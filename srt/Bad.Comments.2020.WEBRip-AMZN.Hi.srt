00:32:18,375 --> 00:32:21,958
You know, it had nothing to
do with Frank or friendship.

523
00:32:22,083 --> 00:32:25,000
Or anything.
I got this role from the producer.

524
00:32:25,291 --> 00:32:29,833
So you need to get your
information straight.

525
00:32:29,958 --> 00:32:31,934
Interviewer-we all know the
role was meant for Frank Orji.

526
00:32:31,958 --> 00:32:33,875
Well that doesn't concern me.

527
00:32:34,541 --> 00:32:37,958
Let's talk about this video
of Frank, circulating the net.

528
00:32:38,666 --> 00:32:44,791
- He is your very good friend.
- [chuckles] Good is a very, too strong a word to use.

529
00:32:45,166 --> 00:32:50,666
You know we, yeah we're like acquaintances,
but not as tight as you're saying.

530
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:52,916
But you're together a lot.

531
00:32:53,333 --> 00:32:56,291
I see tons of instagram
photos with you and Frank Orji.

532
00:32:56,416 --> 00:33:00,875
[chuckles lightly] wait up a bit.
We work, often okay.

533
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:08,750
And then, um yeah of course, because when you're on
the job People tend to think y'all are close friends

534
00:33:08,875 --> 00:33:12,250
but hey, we're just mere colleagues.

535
00:33:12,583 --> 00:33:14,750
You mean you're not
friends with Frank Orji.

536
00:33:14,875 --> 00:33:17,583
[chuckles lightly]
No.

537
00:33:23,583 --> 00:33:26,208
I stayed with them long after my flight.

538
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:34,125
It was announced to ensure he was fine. To ensure he was
comfortable before we went ahead to catch our flight.

539
00:33:34,250 --> 00:33:36,166
That day.

540
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:44,000
The fact that the video was doctored to a
point clearly reveals the malicious intent

541
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:45,500
of its author.

542
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:53,500
Truth Hurts, the online troll.
We know how he or she operates.

543
00:33:54,791 --> 00:33:57,500
They target people like myself.

544
00:33:58,625 --> 00:33:59,750
I'm totally innocent.

545
00:34:00,916 --> 00:34:02,708
I rose through the ranks.

546
00:34:03,333 --> 00:34:08,375
My early twenties, in this noble profession
and most of you know me

547
00:34:08,916 --> 00:34:11,500
I've never lifted a finger to hurt anyone.

548
00:34:11,916 --> 00:34:13,875
I've always been respectful of everyone.

549
00:34:15,166 --> 00:34:17,625
Look into it and understand
purely what this is.

550
00:34:18,291 --> 00:34:19,291
That I'm a target.

551
00:34:20,125 --> 00:34:21,125
Of online trolls.

552
00:34:22,166 --> 00:34:24,500
Thank you for coming
out to hear my version.

553
00:34:25,291 --> 00:34:28,041
Are there any questions for our Mr Orji?

554
00:34:28,208 --> 00:34:29,708
Yes

555
00:34:31,041 --> 00:34:32,250
Er, lady in the back.

556
00:34:32,666 --> 00:34:35,250
Some people will say
this is PR damage control

557
00:34:35,958 --> 00:34:39,125
Or have you actually gone to see
the man, to ensure he's still fine?

558
00:34:44,208 --> 00:34:47,958
Mr Frank,. Mr Frank please,
You can't do this.

559
00:34:48,083 --> 00:34:49,958
You can't do this. You're wicked!

560
00:34:50,083 --> 00:34:51,958
[indistinct shouting]

561
00:34:52,083 --> 00:34:53,958
You're wicked. You're too wicked.

562
00:34:54,083 --> 00:34:56,041
[indistinct shouting]

563
00:34:56,833 --> 00:34:57,625
No comments.

564
00:34:57,750 --> 00:34:59,708
Mr Frank.

565
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:02,500
[car door jams]
[sighs frustratedly]

566
00:35:02,625 --> 00:35:04,500
We need this old man to speak.

567
00:35:04,625 --> 00:35:07,416
To clear you and say the truth.

568
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Arrgh.

569
00:35:10,583 --> 00:35:13,375
Let me try and find his number.

570
00:35:14,041 --> 00:35:15,541
No comment please!

571
00:35:20,208 --> 00:35:23,916
Yes that is, that is fine.
I assure that, that would be just fine.

572
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:25,916
Okay.
Thank you.

573
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:27,875
[sighs deeply]

574
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,125
Okay he has agreed to tell
his side of the story.

575
00:35:32,541 --> 00:35:36,458
He went to the airport to see his
son, who works in a private lounge.

576
00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:38,458
He bumped into you accidentally.

577
00:35:38,958 --> 00:35:39,958
Okay.

578
00:35:40,833 --> 00:35:43,041
Okay pay him whatever he wants. Okay.

579
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:45,650
This nightmare has to be over with.

580
00:35:46,583 --> 00:35:50,500
On it Boss.
- Then he has to release the testimony video on time.

581
00:35:50,750 --> 00:35:52,083
Absolutely.
Alright.

582
00:35:59,916 --> 00:36:00,916
Baby.

583
00:36:01,416 --> 00:36:04,583
Well this is where the magic happens.

584
00:36:10,166 --> 00:36:14,666
[making out]

585
00:36:35,833 --> 00:36:38,958
Hold that thought.

586
00:36:39,083 --> 00:36:41,666
I don't want distractions over here.

587
00:36:45,458 --> 00:36:47,541
Yeah I knew it was you, what do you want?

588
00:36:49,833 --> 00:36:50,875
Hmmm

589
00:36:53,708 --> 00:36:54,708
[call ends abruptly]

590
00:36:57,875 --> 00:37:00,750
When the slap of Frank Orji
landed me on the floor.

591
00:37:00,875 --> 00:37:06,541
I was looking for a pastor to confess
my sins before my iminent death.

592
00:37:06,958 --> 00:37:08,333
Then he started kicking me.

593
00:37:08,666 --> 00:37:10,125
Marching me on the ground.

594
00:37:10,625 --> 00:37:12,500
No mercy at all.

595
00:37:12,958 --> 00:37:13,958
Eh.

596
00:37:14,708 --> 00:37:15,708
Oh.

597
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:21,875
Please fellow Nigerians, anyday you
see snake on one side of the road

598
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,625
coming towards you, then
Frank Orji on the other end

599
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,500
please rush to the side of snake because

600
00:37:28,833 --> 00:37:31,250
Frank Orji is a Devil.

601
00:37:32,833 --> 00:37:39,416
Frank, are you mad? Did nepa take
light in your head you dingbat?

602
00:37:40,625 --> 00:37:42,958
You beat an old man.

603
00:37:44,333 --> 00:37:46,750
Is your entire generation cursed?

604
00:37:47,166 --> 00:37:50,583
Why are you lending yourself to
the propagation of stupidity?

605
00:37:51,166 --> 00:37:54,750
And surrendering your soul
to idiocy for life. [tuts]

606
00:37:54,875 --> 00:37:56,833
Babe, did you really do that?

607
00:37:57,583 --> 00:38:00,208
[stutters]

608
00:38:00,833 --> 00:38:02,791
That's not me. Why are
you giving me that look?

609
00:38:02,916 --> 00:38:04,833
That's not me.
Don't even touch me.

610
00:38:05,875 --> 00:38:09,500
That's so mean, how could you be..
No, no, no

611
00:38:09,583 --> 00:38:11,500
No, no, no I'm not that guy.

612
00:38:11,583 --> 00:38:14,125
This is nothing, this is not me.

613
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:18,750
I'm being set up, babe.
Don't babe me.

614
00:38:18,875 --> 00:38:20,750
Babe wait, hey, hey, eh

615
00:38:20,875 --> 00:38:22,833
Come back.
Babe!

616
00:38:23,625 --> 00:38:24,625
Bring this thing back.

617
00:38:29,416 --> 00:38:32,041
What is going on with my life?

618
00:38:32,833 --> 00:38:35,208
[phone dials]

619
00:38:35,333 --> 00:38:37,041
Hilda, what is going on?

620
00:38:37,208 --> 00:38:38,958
Frank I need you to calm down.

621
00:38:39,083 --> 00:38:40,843
- I'm working on it.
- What did I just watch?

622
00:38:41,166 --> 00:38:42,541
Gentle men of the press.

623
00:38:42,750 --> 00:38:47,833
With immediate effect, Frank Orji is hereby
expelled from the Actors Guild of Nigeria.

624
00:38:48,458 --> 00:38:53,500
No Producer or any Production Company is
allowed to work or do business with him.

625
00:38:54,125 --> 00:38:55,325
Hey everyone, what's going on?

626
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:59,500
This is your girl, The Real Warri Pikin
[self eulogy]

627
00:38:59,750 --> 00:39:03,583
There is a matter that has gotten my
attention. Hearing it made me weak.

628
00:39:03,916 --> 00:39:07,750
It's that video that has Frank Orji beating
on a man old enough to be his father.

629
00:39:07,875 --> 00:39:11,958
[speaking in parables]

630
00:39:12,125 --> 00:39:14,583
Frank Orji, let me tell you.
You're messing up.

631
00:39:14,750 --> 00:39:16,708
You beat a man old enough to birth you.

632
00:39:16,833 --> 00:39:20,083
You see, you meet your waterloo.

633
00:39:20,208 --> 00:39:25,291
Yes I [stutters] understand that they're
painting it out to be something different.

634
00:39:25,416 --> 00:39:30,041
But that is honestly not the case. Once again.
I assure you that he is an amazing client.

635
00:39:31,166 --> 00:39:34,666
Yes I [stutters]... really?

636
00:39:35,041 --> 00:39:36,333
Hello ma'am.

637
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:39,500
Really? Thast...

638
00:39:44,416 --> 00:39:45,416
Hel...

639
00:39:56,750 --> 00:40:00,416
Don't sir, with all due respect, the
information that you have is not accurate.

640
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:03,458
My client is very respectful.

641
00:40:04,250 --> 00:40:06,708
Sir I need you to
understand what I'm saying.

642
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,041
Sir.
Hello.

643
00:40:10,625 --> 00:40:13,750
Um, this is Frank Orji.

644
00:40:14,250 --> 00:40:15,250
Do you have a minute sir?

645
00:40:17,833 --> 00:40:25,208
Okay, it's in view of what is going on.
Listen sir, it's nothing like me.

646
00:40:27,291 --> 00:40:28,291
I know I can prove it.

647
00:40:28,625 --> 00:40:30,708
But it's obvious that I'm being set up

648
00:40:30,833 --> 00:40:32,500
I'm being set up, trust me.

649
00:40:33,250 --> 00:40:36,416
Everything [stuttering] is an indication

650
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:39,458
Listen Frank, I'm only
going to say this once.

651
00:40:40,375 --> 00:40:41,375
So listen carefully.

652
00:40:42,208 --> 00:40:47,333
[speaking foreign language]

653
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:51,166
Listen em, sir, I don't mean
to be disrespectful but please

654
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:53,375
You think maybe you can speak English?

655
00:40:53,541 --> 00:40:57,625
[continues speaking foreign language]

656
00:40:59,125 --> 00:41:01,416
Erm, I can't understand what...

657
00:41:02,916 --> 00:41:05,416
There, I hope we have an understanding.

658
00:41:05,833 --> 00:41:07,583
Understanding.
Understanding about what?

659
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:09,500
Have a great day.

660
00:41:11,291 --> 00:41:12,291
[call clicks]

661
00:41:12,541 --> 00:41:13,791
Sir, hello?

662
00:41:16,958 --> 00:41:17,958
Boss.

663
00:41:18,916 --> 00:41:25,166
Boss please do not tell me that we
just lost the Xiaomi mobile deal.

664
00:41:26,291 --> 00:41:27,291
Boss.

665
00:41:34,625 --> 00:41:39,083
Come come

666
00:41:39,208 --> 00:41:41,125
Thank you.
Yeah.

667
00:41:41,833 --> 00:41:48,000
I hope you are ready to be the first
African Brand Ambassador of Xiaomi Mobile.

668
00:41:48,875 --> 00:41:50,458
Warri Never Comes Last mhen.

669
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,041
No, that simply means I'm
%100 in love with your brand.

670
00:41:55,875 --> 00:41:58,791
Hahaha, thank you my brother, thank you.

671
00:42:05,375 --> 00:42:07,958
What is going on in my life?

672
00:42:08,250 --> 00:42:09,916
Who is after me? Who wants to destroy me?

673
00:42:10,041 --> 00:42:12,958
What did I do?
I've treated everybody fairly.

674
00:42:13,125 --> 00:42:14,958
Have I not?
Boss I need you to calm down.

675
00:42:15,083 --> 00:42:17,123
- Please sit down and calm down.
- No you calm down.

676
00:42:17,166 --> 00:42:18,166
You calm down.

677
00:42:24,708 --> 00:42:25,750
[door locks]

678
00:42:36,416 --> 00:42:38,583
What are they doing here?
You beat that baba now?

679
00:42:40,125 --> 00:42:42,708
That old man that has cancer.

680
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:48,500
You beat him?

681
00:42:48,625 --> 00:42:49,625
Huh [tuts]

682
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,000
Okpetu.

683
00:42:51,708 --> 00:42:52,708
Heavy abomination

684
00:42:54,791 --> 00:42:55,791
That's a curse.

685
00:42:56,750 --> 00:42:59,541
And that curse will follow
you everywhere you go

686
00:43:00,416 --> 00:43:01,541
like stinky beans.

687
00:43:02,958 --> 00:43:06,458
Anything you touch will die
like it was doused in acid.

688
00:43:07,583 --> 00:43:10,208
But sir, even as you're sitting
down, do you have any idea

689
00:43:10,333 --> 00:43:15,250
Do you have the slightest idea of how
many demons are playing house with you.

690
00:43:15,583 --> 00:43:17,375
Come on shut up. Will you shut up?

691
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,200
You have demons in your mouth.

692
00:43:20,291 --> 00:43:22,791
Oh oh, you've ganged up against me too.

693
00:43:23,291 --> 00:43:26,958
[stutters] I told you there's a conspiracy, you

I'm a monster right?

697
00:43:32,791 --> 00:43:34,083

Almost dead, then they wanted to throw her out

815
00:50:47,500 --> 00:50:48,500
That's

00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:06,666
Frank don't say that.

870
00:54:07,916 --> 00:54:09,041
Nobody loves me.

871
00:54:12,791 --> 00:54:13,791
Frank I love you.

872
00:54:16,750 --> 00:54:18,000
I'm a national joke.

873
00:54:25,041 --> 00:54:27,583
Have you heard of NOTA?

874
00:54:29,958 --> 00:54:30,958
Who?

875
00:54:32,750 --> 00:54:34,708
Nolly Old Timers Association.

876
00:54:37,208 --> 00:54:38,208
What about them?

877
00:54:41,500 --> 00:54:42,708
They offered me a membership.

878
00:54:44,375 --> 00:54:46,583
[laughs]

879
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,875
Those losers offered me
a seat at their table.

880
00:54:52,833 --> 00:54:54,583
That's what has become of my life.

881
00:54:56,125 --> 00:54:58,750
Frank you know as crazy as it sounds,

882
00:54:59,708 --> 00:55:01,750
[sighs] maybe it's not a bad idea.

883
00:55:06,041 --> 00:55:08,641
It's better than you being in this
big 'ol house all by yourself.

884
00:55:08,916 --> 00:55:10,676
Someone actually wants
to hang out with you.

885
00:55:11,541 --> 00:55:12,581
You should think about it.

886
00:55:14,083 --> 00:55:15,083
[exhales]

887
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:16,375
This place is a mess.

888
00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:18,375
♪ Dry bones shall rise again ♪

889
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:21,583

895
00:56:25,541 --> 00:56:31,625
Man - It was after the Frankfurt trip.
As things started going bad.

896
00:56:34,333 --> 00:56:36,375
But Germany, ahh!

897
00:56:38,625 --> 00:56:41,916
Germany is my favourite place. Of all time.

898
00:56:42,541 --> 00:56:44,750
well mine was Atlanta 2009

899
00:56:45,791 --> 00:56:47,625
I did 7 movies back to back.

900
00:56:48,583 --> 00:56:53,625
15,000 dollars each movie.
Well those good old days.

901
00:56:54,208 --> 00:56:57,708
What about you Mr Lawani,
what brought you down?

902
00:56:58,791 --> 00:57:00,750
Same as you, bad comments

903
00:57:04,041 --> 00:57:08,041
my own case, after my
cheating and divorce scandal

904
00:57:09,458 --> 00:57:12,333
bad comments from thousands
of people, I don't even know

905
00:57:13,375 --> 00:57:16,708
On facebook, twitter, I saw my
career going down the drain.

906
00:57:16,833 --> 00:57:17,833
Me too oo

907
00:57:19,083 --> 00:57:25,375
Just because of a little scandal, my
career ended even before it started.

908
00:57:27,208 --> 00:57:31,458
Bros, hmm?
Drink oo, drink and forget your sorrows.

909
00:57:31,750 --> 00:57:32,750
Cheer up.

910
00:57:33,791 --> 00:57:35,333
Most stars will fall.

911
00:57:35,458 --> 00:57:38,375
[affirmative murmur]
We pray that,

912
00:57:39,833 --> 00:57:43,208
And then we have men like
you, who have money you know.

913
00:57:43,625 --> 00:57:44,416
Hmm

914
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:48,333
People who can bring value to the table

915
00:57:48,750 --> 00:57:51,041
- exactly.
- Not all these wish washing people you know.

916
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:53,375
Hm barman

917
00:57:53,625 --> 00:57:55,875
Do you know what is easy to forget?

918
00:57:56,416 --> 00:57:57,416
People have power.

919
00:57:59,750 --> 00:58:03,375
The most powerful is the mouth.
Social media represents our mouth.

920
00:58:04,291 --> 00:58:07,375
Hence it is as powerful as the
words that leave our mouths.

921
00:58:07,708 --> 00:58:11,833
But the words and deeds being projected
on social media these days are disturbing.

922
00:58:12,666 --> 00:58:14,625
One word typed can break a heart.

923
00:58:15,208 --> 00:58:16,768
[background chatter]
and depress a soul.

924
00:58:16,958 --> 00:58:19,333
One picture being shared
can break a marriage.

925
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:23,291
Some even use it to broadcast the
false representation of their lives.

926
00:58:23,416 --> 00:58:24,416
To their followers.

927
00:58:25,125 --> 00:58:27,375
Flaunting things they
don't own in real life.

928
00:58:28,583 --> 00:58:31,333
Fake life makes a huge
part of social media today.

929
00:58:32,458 --> 00:58:35,375
Today's social media, everyone
wants to be a reporter,

930
00:58:35,833 --> 00:58:39,833
so they'll rather whip out their phones
to record am incident or accident.

931
00:58:39,958 --> 00:58:42,625
Rather than render a
helping hand to the victim.

932
00:58:43,958 --> 00:58:50,625
Many have lost jobs, relationships and families
because of their treacherous social media activities

933
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:55,458
Because of their bad comments.

934
00:58:59,958 --> 00:59:01,158
Something good came out of it.

935
00:59:03,041 --> 00:59:04,041
Like what?

936
00:59:05,625 --> 00:59:07,208
God used it to bring you to us now.

937
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:10,000
So this is it?

938
00:59:10,541 --> 00:59:12,791
This is forever?

939
00:59:13,541 --> 00:59:14,916
Nothing, there's no recourse?

940
00:59:15,250 --> 00:59:17,291
We're down and out for good?

941
00:59:18,166 --> 00:59:21,666
My brother, you have enjoyed life to
the fullest. What else do you want?

942
00:59:23,750 --> 00:59:26,083
What about the person that did this to me?

943
00:59:26,625 --> 00:59:27,791
That did this to all of us.

944
00:59:28,500 --> 00:59:29,660
The people that are doing it.

945
00:59:30,625 --> 00:59:31,625
What are you going to do?

946
00:59:32,125 --> 00:59:33,458
Track them down and punish them?

947
00:59:34,083 --> 00:59:35,375
[chuckles lightly]
Listen,

948
00:59:35,625 --> 00:59:39,250
the reason why this people flourish
is because no one is challenging them.

949
00:59:39,375 --> 00:59:42,125
Think.
is because no one is challenging them

950
00:59:42,250 --> 00:59:44,250
..is because no one is challenging them

951
00:59:44,375 --> 00:59:46,333
Do you even know what that sounds like?

952
00:59:48,041 --> 00:59:51,583
It's ill informed, unrealistic and dumb.

953
00:59:52,666 --> 00:59:56,583
You know what Boss, I.. I'm not even
gonna let you do it, you're not doing it.

954
00:59:57,541 --> 00:59:58,541
No.

955
00:59:58,583 --> 00:59:59,791
Listen to me arrgh.

956
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,708
You're the only one who stood
by me throughout this ordeal.

957
01:00:07,083 --> 01:00:08,208
I was loosing my mind.

958
01:00:09,458 --> 01:00:12,083
Now scratch that, I
lost my mind completely.

959
01:00:13,625 --> 01:00:15,083
I lost everything but money.

960
01:00:15,791 --> 01:00:16,833
Everything.

961
01:00:18,916 --> 01:00:20,125
Everybody abandoned me.

962
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,291
I.. I don't know where this is leading

963
01:00:26,375 --> 01:00:29,500
I just know that if I never
get back up, it doesn't matter.

964
01:00:31,166 --> 01:00:32,166
But I must get even.

965
01:00:35,250 --> 01:00:37,666
Boss what exactly does this accomplish now?

966
01:00:38,583 --> 01:00:39,625
What?

967
01:00:43,666 --> 01:00:44,708
I don't know Hilda.

968
01:00:46,958 --> 01:00:48,625
Maybe I'll be saving the next guy.

969
01:00:59,458 --> 01:01:00,458
Fine.

970
01:01:02,375 --> 01:01:03,375
Fine.

971
01:01:04,583 --> 01:01:05,583
Where do we start?

972
01:01:54,666 --> 01:01:58,708
The name is Roma and I've always wanted
to be a blackhat hacker since I was 13.

973
01:02:01,833 --> 01:02:04,166
Hmm [sucks straw]

974
01:02:19,458 --> 01:02:23,458
Welcome to the interview,
Mr Tunde Tornado.

975
01:02:24,625 --> 01:02:26,833
Now tell me a little about yourself.

976
01:02:26,958 --> 01:02:28,916
Tunde Tornado

977
01:02:32,541 --> 01:02:34,125
Tunde Tornado.

978
01:02:34,291 --> 01:02:38,333
Oh okay, do you think that you
can speak just a little louder?

979
01:02:38,458 --> 01:02:39,458
I'm already shouting.

980
01:02:39,833 --> 01:02:41,041
What is he saying?

981
01:02:42,458 --> 01:02:43,666
This is the loudest I can do.

982
01:02:44,208 --> 01:02:45,875
Tunde Tornado.

983
01:02:46,416 --> 01:02:47,416
Do you want me or not?

984
01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:50,500
Hilda

985
01:02:51,375 --> 01:02:52,416
You're our point woman.

986
01:02:53,750 --> 01:02:58,666
I want you to make a list of the
top trolls in Sub-Saharan Africa.

987
01:02:59,041 --> 01:03:00,083
Everyone of them.

988
01:03:01,791 --> 01:03:04,541
I want you to design the
strategy of approach.

989
01:03:05,458 --> 01:03:06,458
And attack.

990
01:03:07,041 --> 01:03:07,750
Understood?

991
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:09,083
Got it Boss, on it.

992
01:03:10,041 --> 01:03:12,750
Roma, take that list

993
01:03:14,708 --> 01:03:15,708
Find them.

994
01:03:16,625 --> 01:03:17,916
I want to know where they live.

995
01:03:19,208 --> 01:03:20,688
I want to know who their friends are.

996
01:03:21,333 --> 01:03:22,416
Who their families are.

997
01:03:22,916 --> 01:03:24,916
Where they work, who they work for.

998
01:03:25,083 --> 01:03:26,791
Their strengths, their weaknesses.

999
01:03:27,166 --> 01:03:28,166
What makes them tick.

1000
01:03:29,958 --> 01:03:32,083
I want to understand their
motives for doing this.

1001
01:03:32,333 --> 01:03:35,125
If they take a piss, I want to hear live.

1002
01:03:35,458 --> 01:03:37,583
On camera, understood?

1003
01:03:37,708 --> 01:03:39,500
Yes boss, I'm already on it.

1004
01:03:39,916 --> 01:03:43,166
Tornado, I want you to
understand your unique position,

1005
01:03:46,208 --> 01:03:47,625
You are my weapon of choice.

1006
01:03:49,291 --> 01:03:53,833
You're the street general.
I want you to pick your top lieutenants

1007
01:03:53,958 --> 01:03:56,458
out in the streets and
place them strategically.

1008
01:03:57,875 --> 01:03:59,625
We're going to take pain to them.

1009
01:04:01,166 --> 01:04:03,375
I want you to make it hurt.

1010
01:04:04,875 --> 01:04:05,875
Understood?

1011
01:04:06,541 --> 01:04:07,791
They'll pay for it.

1012
01:04:08,833 --> 01:04:12,041
Several trolls occupy
the social media world,

1013
01:04:12,666 --> 01:04:16,166
but none as worse as this three.
First up,

1014
01:04:16,708 --> 01:04:17,708
Ojuju.

1015
01:04:18,291 --> 01:04:20,625
Next we have busy body 2000

1016
01:04:20,750 --> 01:04:24,458
Now this troll paints famous
people in silly lights

1017
01:04:25,083 --> 01:04:29,541
provoking tons of millions of bad comments.

1018
01:04:29,666 --> 01:04:31,458
Which of course make the celebrities upset.

1019
01:04:31,750 --> 01:04:33,458
And worst of them all, \

1020
01:04:35,833 --> 01:04:36,833
Truth Hurts.

1021
01:04:37,208 --> 01:04:45,208
Now his specialty is having false accusations
with audio, video and photo proof.

1022
01:04:46,583 --> 01:04:48,125
This one started it

1023
01:04:51,583 --> 01:04:53,291
I want this one first.

1024
01:04:56,791 --> 01:04:59,250
Go away, get out of my way, I'll...

1025
01:05:04,916 --> 01:05:07,500
Handle @obinnafashionista

1026
01:05:07,791 --> 01:05:11,666
Always claiming to have slept
with Nollywood guys apparently.

1027
01:05:14,416 --> 01:05:16,083
So what is he, gay?

1028
01:05:16,791 --> 01:05:21,750
Arrrgh, apparently not. He just likes
breaking homes of male celebrities.

1029
01:05:22,375 --> 01:05:27,083
Real name, Maruf Okanle.
A tailor from Ikorodu.

1030
01:05:27,291 --> 01:05:29,500
[soft chuckle] See his head like a coconut.

1031
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,583
- What?
- I said his head looks like a coconut.

1032
01:05:33,166 --> 01:05:34,166
Coconut?

1033
01:05:34,250 --> 01:05:35,833
Yes, his head is a coconut.

1034
01:05:37,583 --> 01:05:39,063
I'm shouting, can't you guys hear me?

1035
01:05:39,208 --> 01:05:41,048
Can't you guys hear me?
No no, we can hear you.

1036
01:05:41,125 --> 01:05:44,000
All of you are crazy here.
We can hear you chairman.

1037
01:05:44,291 --> 01:05:46,375
Calm down. The guy is very ugly. [tuts]

1038
01:05:46,500 --> 01:05:48,833
we know [ laughter]

1039
01:05:50,500 --> 01:05:55,833
Roma - I DM'd him after we trolled Tiwa
Savage, to meet me for a job. Isent him 50k

1040
01:05:55,958 --> 01:06:00,125
and said I had to see him in
person to balance him another 50k.

1041
01:06:00,625 --> 01:06:01,666
[knocking]

1042
01:06:02,166 --> 01:06:03,500
Come in.
[opens door]

1043
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:07,583
The biggest celebrity blogger.

1044
01:06:07,833 --> 01:06:09,208
How are you?
I'm good bro.

1045
01:06:09,333 --> 01:06:10,333
Got the balance?

1046
01:06:11,625 --> 01:06:12,625
Here's your balance.

1047
01:06:15,333 --> 01:06:17,666
How would you be killing the story.
Come on.

1048
01:06:18,583 --> 01:06:20,291
The story will be dead in a few minutes.

1049
01:06:21,500 --> 01:06:24,125
This is what we do guy, come on.
I'm good at this, you know this.

1050
01:06:25,125 --> 01:06:30,916
But how will you now convince the
people that the guy isn't really gay?

1051
01:06:31,208 --> 01:06:32,916
And that he didn't really sleep with you.

1052
01:06:34,166 --> 01:06:37,086
I'll come up with the narrative that
I mistook his name for someone else.

1053
01:06:38,083 --> 01:06:39,375
Than the culprit right?

1054
01:06:42,708 --> 01:06:43,828
Then the story will be dead.

1055
01:06:45,750 --> 01:06:47,708
Very good, so you're really not gay.

1056
01:06:48,750 --> 01:06:49,750
Here you go.

1057
01:06:52,375 --> 01:06:57,500
[hearty laughter]
Alright.

1058
01:06:58,166 --> 01:07:00,250
Who is next?
Cletus Mbanefo.

1059
01:07:01,125 --> 01:07:04,708
Loves to troll actresses
and female dignitaries.

1060
01:07:05,708 --> 01:07:08,625
Asking if they enjoyed their
night of bliss with him.

1061
01:07:55,958 --> 01:07:56,791
Common wake up.

1062
01:07:56,916 --> 01:07:57,916
Huh?

1063
01:07:59,708 --> 01:08:00,708
What is it?

1064
01:08:01,416 --> 01:08:02,416
A ha.

1065
01:08:04,583 --> 01:08:05,625
Who are these guys?

1066
01:08:07,708 --> 01:08:08,750
What is it?

1067
01:08:10,833 --> 01:08:18,750
No!

1068
01:08:28,666 --> 01:08:30,750
Oh my god. [gushing]

1069
01:08:30,875 --> 01:08:33,708
[gigling excitedly]

1070
01:08:37,791 --> 01:08:39,791
Awww.

1071
01:08:41,958 --> 01:08:44,125
Awwww, [excitement]

1072
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,708
[screams] [splash]
Oh my god.

1073
01:08:59,750 --> 01:09:00,750
Are you crazy?

1074
01:09:00,833 --> 01:09:02,708
Are you crazy?

1075
01:09:03,125 --> 01:09:04,708
Why did you do thjs?

1076
01:09:05,083 --> 01:09:06,125
Crazy.

1077
01:09:07,958 --> 01:09:12,958
Who propose go fear. God dey.
You stupid bitch.

1078
01:09:13,083 --> 01:09:16,291
[inaudible]

1079
01:09:20,916 --> 01:09:21,916
Tracy.

1080
01:09:23,458 --> 01:09:26,916
[laughs]
Just look. Look...

1081
01:09:27,041 --> 01:09:28,958
Look at her.

1082
01:09:30,333 --> 01:09:31,583
And the best for the last.

1083
01:09:32,333 --> 01:09:33,583
I caught one of the big 3.

1084
01:09:36,500 --> 01:09:38,166
Natasha Adebayor

1085
01:09:38,750 --> 01:09:41,083
There's something different about this one.

1086
01:09:42,666 --> 01:09:43,666
Yeah

1087
01:09:44,416 --> 01:09:48,583
She doesn't fit the mod
of your regular troll.

1088
01:09:48,750 --> 01:09:49,750
Uh huh.

1089
01:09:51,583 --> 01:09:53,458
None of them look like online trolls.

1090
01:09:54,125 --> 01:09:57,583
They're lions online and
then pussycats in real life.

1091
01:09:59,083 --> 01:10:00,083
She's too fine.

1092
01:10:00,666 --> 01:10:01,666
What?

1093
01:10:02,250 --> 01:10:03,666
She's a goddess of beauty.

1094
01:10:04,166 --> 01:10:05,166
Huh?

1095
01:10:05,833 --> 01:10:08,541
Everytime, you guys pretend
like you can't hear me.

1096
01:10:09,500 --> 01:10:11,166
Please leave me.

1097
01:10:13,875 --> 01:10:16,250
Okay, what's her story?

1098
01:10:17,500 --> 01:10:18,791
Her story is

1099
01:10:19,083 --> 01:10:22,291
um, teacher of the year,
two times in a row.

1100
01:10:22,708 --> 01:10:29,875
Volunteers with the red cross at her free
time and advocates against child abuse.

1101
01:10:30,500 --> 01:10:34,791
My point exactly, that
is not the MO of a troll.

1102
01:10:35,250 --> 01:10:36,541
Let alone Ojuju

1103
01:10:36,708 --> 01:10:40,625
uh, maybe her phone was hacked?
No

1104
01:10:40,958 --> 01:10:44,500
Not likely, except her
device is being shared.

1105
01:10:45,500 --> 01:10:48,291
But I don't think her
accounts is the problem.

1106
01:10:48,458 --> 01:10:50,125
It has to be her device.

1107
01:10:50,583 --> 01:10:54,500
Listen erm, as much as I want
to get back at these bastards

1108
01:10:55,583 --> 01:10:57,958
It will really kill me to
hurt an innocent person.

1109
01:11:00,375 --> 01:11:02,708
Okay then how do we ascertain that?

1110
01:11:04,708 --> 01:11:09,291
[water clattering]

1111
01:11:41,291 --> 01:11:42,291
Hey is that not Frank?

1112
01:11:42,416 --> 01:11:46,000
Oh shit!
Frank! It's Frank.

1113
01:11:46,125 --> 01:11:48,666
Go back guys, whoa!
[kids squealing excitedly]

1114
01:11:48,791 --> 01:11:52,500
Whoa!

1115
01:11:53,083 --> 01:11:56,791
Hey, children stop. oh guys!
Stop that, please go into the bus.

1116
01:11:56,916 --> 01:11:58,791
Go into the bus quickly.
Let me get a minute.

1117
01:11:58,916 --> 01:12:00,250
To the bus, into the bus.

1118
01:12:00,375 --> 01:12:02,208
[excited chatter]

1119
01:12:02,333 --> 01:12:03,625
nice to meet you guys.

1120
01:12:04,833 --> 01:12:07,125
Trust me the love is reciprocal.

1121
01:12:07,500 --> 01:12:09,140
You wanna help me up please?
Frank Orji.

1122
01:12:09,291 --> 01:12:11,125
Yes.
Erm..

1123
01:12:12,125 --> 01:12:13,500
What brings you here?

1124
01:12:13,666 --> 01:12:18,625
Eh well, I hope you're not gonna
kick me down and spit on me

1125
01:12:19,333 --> 01:12:20,833
No why would I do that?

1126
01:12:21,250 --> 01:12:22,250
I'm a huge fan.

1127
01:12:23,083 --> 01:12:25,723
Oh you are? Well that didn. t stop
the others doing the same thing.

1128
01:12:28,083 --> 01:12:30,458
So um, what brings you here?

1129
01:12:31,750 --> 01:12:33,708
Just you know coming out here to,

1130
01:12:34,541 --> 01:12:36,125
Look around and see em,

1131
01:12:36,583 --> 01:12:39,125
Erm, Oh, I know

1132
01:12:39,416 --> 01:12:41,125
You're doing research

1133
01:12:41,416 --> 01:12:44,875
for a movie and you want to use
our school as your case study.

1134
01:12:45,875 --> 01:12:48,125
Oh aren't you quite the genius.

1135
01:12:48,250 --> 01:12:49,541
[laughs]

1136
01:12:50,041 --> 01:12:51,458
That was very quick of the optic

1137
01:12:51,791 --> 01:12:53,000
Actually I was um,

1138
01:12:53,333 --> 01:12:54,541
yes, new movie role.

1139
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:56,541
Um playing a teacher,

1140
01:12:56,666 --> 01:13:00,500
thought somebody said come check
out this school, and you know

1141
01:13:00,583 --> 01:13:03,000
see if I can understudy
a proper teacher and em,

1142
01:13:03,833 --> 01:13:04,833
and go from there.

1143
01:13:04,916 --> 01:13:08,500
Well Mrs Isaac would be
glad to do it because she

1144
01:13:08,583 --> 01:13:10,541
absolutely loves Nollywood movies.

1145
01:13:11,750 --> 01:13:12,750
But...

1146
01:13:13,166 --> 01:13:15,458
I think having you in my class
will be quite distracting.

1147
01:13:15,833 --> 01:13:17,233
Looking at what you did to my kids.

1148
01:13:17,500 --> 01:13:18,500
Hmm uh.

1149
01:13:19,625 --> 01:13:25,708
Um I think I might have
a solution to that one.

1150
01:13:32,375 --> 01:13:40,375
[music]

1151
01:13:49,416 --> 01:13:53,875
- Good morning class.
- Good morning Miss Tasha.

1152
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:57,333
Today we're going to be discussing
the addition of decimal fractions

1153
01:13:57,458 --> 01:13:59,916
and we have an example on
the board as you can see.

1154
01:14:00,250 --> 01:14:01,833
So 0.914

1155
01:14:01,958 --> 01:14:04,541
plus 0.035, who can give me the answer?

1156
01:14:05,666 --> 01:14:06,666
Hmmm

1157
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:13,958
[clapping]

1158
01:14:14,083 --> 01:14:20,208
9th question.
Calp for her everyone. [clapping]

1159
01:14:22,208 --> 01:14:24,166
so here we have that.

1160
01:14:26,166 --> 01:14:31,250
[laughing] no no no, it is not a laughing
matter. Lady, I am a very rich man.

1161
01:14:31,375 --> 01:14:35,000
Take a 100 dollar, Lady put
your name and phone number.

1162
01:14:35,125 --> 01:14:38,333
Lady put your name and
number, let me take it up.

1163
01:14:38,458 --> 01:14:42,750
You're going to make my
ribs hurt with this..

1164
01:14:42,875 --> 01:14:44,791
I could keep this up all day.

1165
01:14:49,875 --> 01:14:51,500
I like to see you very happy.

1166
01:14:54,541 --> 01:14:56,958
It's no wonder these kids just adore you.

1167
01:14:59,833 --> 01:15:03,125
But you know, I wonder what
your other face is like.

1168
01:15:07,250 --> 01:15:14,000
With me, what you see is what you get.
Hmm, I beg to differ.

1169
01:15:15,208 --> 01:15:16,791
I think people have two faces.

1170
01:15:18,208 --> 01:15:21,875
One they show to the world
and the other in the shadows.

1171
01:15:23,500 --> 01:15:25,666
Frank, that sounds like
a line from a movie.

1172
01:15:25,791 --> 01:15:28,041
Nah this is a line from life.

1173
01:15:31,208 --> 01:15:37,166
Um well... Tasha is a very happy person.

1174
01:15:37,875 --> 01:15:38,958
Tasha is happy.

1175
01:15:39,500 --> 01:15:44,208
And my guilty pleasures are apple martinis

1176
01:15:44,541 --> 01:15:46,000
the occasional shisha.

1177
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:50,541
And sometimes, I google
Chaning Tatum's pictures.

1178
01:15:50,666 --> 01:15:53,625
[laughs]
Oh Jesus, that's dirty.

1179
01:15:53,750 --> 01:15:57,625
But other than that, there are
no skeletons in my cupboard.

1180
01:16:00,125 --> 01:16:03,416
But yeah, this has been
really good but I have to go.

1181
01:16:05,708 --> 01:16:10,791
It doesn't have to end. I mean for all
the research gold you gave me today,

1182
01:16:11,083 --> 01:16:16,958
Yeah I think I should take you out, I know
this good place. I would love to but my mother

1183
01:16:17,083 --> 01:16:20,750
and younger brother are always at it and
I'm the peace maker

1184
01:16:20,875 --> 01:16:22,475
So I actually have to go, but thank you.

1185
01:16:22,500 --> 01:16:27,000
Okay so em, by tomorrow, I'm certain you
would have been done playing united nation.

1186
01:16:27,166 --> 01:16:29,000
[{giggles] You crack me up.

1187
01:16:29,500 --> 01:16:32,250
So maybe we can go get
a bite to eat somewhere.

1188
01:16:33,375 --> 01:16:34,833
Okay, sounds good.

1189
01:16:35,041 --> 01:16:39,000
I know this good place.
Let's get going.

1190
01:16:39,375 --> 01:16:40,375
Ladies first.

1191
01:16:45,583 --> 01:16:49,333
So any word on Truth Hurts?

1192
01:16:51,083 --> 01:16:56,333
[sighs] Boss Truth Hurts has one of the baddest
firewalls I ahve tried and tried and tried.

1193
01:16:57,041 --> 01:17:00,708
But I'm not gonna give up, I'll keep hacking at it till I get it.
- Busybody 2000?

1194
01:17:01,166 --> 01:17:05,500
Same thing as Truth Hurts, but
not as bad or not as complicated.

1195
01:17:06,166 --> 01:17:08,646
Infact I have a guy that can
come up with an algorithm for it.

1196
01:17:09,208 --> 01:17:17,083
Hm, listen bring in whoever you need
to bring in, at whatever cost, okay?

1197
01:17:18,625 --> 01:17:19,833
I want this cracked.

1198
01:17:21,958 --> 01:17:25,458
Were you able to link Tasha to Ojuju?

1199
01:17:26,666 --> 01:17:31,750
Well, no such luck yesterday,

1200
01:17:34,166 --> 01:17:36,250
I will give it another shot tomorrow.

1201
01:17:36,750 --> 01:17:41,791
Boss if you ask me, I think Tasha is Ojuju.
She might not look it, but she is.

1202
01:17:42,500 --> 01:17:48,333
Look at this guy, Man With No Name. Nice guy
in real life, baddest com mentor online.

1203
01:17:48,791 --> 01:17:54,208
These guys, these trolls, they are chameleons.|
You can't let her deceive you Boss.

1204
01:17:54,416 --> 01:17:55,416
Very perky.

1205
01:17:56,375 --> 01:18:00,291
I think there's something
different about her.

1206
01:18:04,041 --> 01:18:08,125
Why? Because she has great
lips, hips and curves?

1207
01:18:10,500 --> 01:18:11,500
Nope.

1208
01:18:13,375 --> 01:18:15,875
I think there's something
beautiful about her inside.

1209
01:18:17,666 --> 01:18:18,750
So you've been inside her.

1210
01:18:19,291 --> 01:18:20,291
[chuckles]

1211
01:18:26,500 --> 01:18:27,500
Wow.

1212
01:18:30,708 --> 01:18:36,583
Let's just say that if
Ojuju happens to be Tasha

1213
01:18:37,958 --> 01:18:39,041
She'll get served.

1214
01:18:39,166 --> 01:18:40,666
Like the rest.

1215
01:18:45,958 --> 01:18:53,958
Madam, whosoever she is, I want her.
Noted.

1216
01:18:58,750 --> 01:18:59,750
Think I'm in love.

1217
01:19:00,250 --> 01:19:05,500
Why did I become a teacher? uh huh. To be
honest, I don't have a noble answer for that.

1218
01:19:07,416 --> 01:19:12,250
I didn't have any plans of saving the world,
or giving the children a better tomorrow.

1219
01:19:12,875 --> 01:19:15,666
After school, I got this job
and I fell in love with it.

1220
01:19:16,250 --> 01:19:17,250
You?

1221
01:19:17,708 --> 01:19:19,083
Hm, fair enough.

1222
01:19:20,166 --> 01:19:21,726
I bet you always wanted to be an actor.

1223
01:19:22,583 --> 01:19:23,583
Hmm.

1224
01:19:24,666 --> 01:19:32,666
You know, I've always wanted this since I was little.
I wanted to be famous, I loved the attention.

1225
01:19:35,333 --> 01:19:38,000
I knew it was my greatest asset, my gift.

1226
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:42,916
And so I pushed for it,
spoke it into existence

1227
01:19:43,833 --> 01:19:46,208
you know, strived for it
and positioned for it.

1228
01:19:46,416 --> 01:19:54,416
Hmm, In no time, I think it was my forth
year. A production company came to school

1229
01:19:54,625 --> 01:19:58,791
And then do the film. Yeah.
The rest is history.

1230
01:19:59,291 --> 01:20:00,791
Do you know, uh huh.

1231
01:20:01,541 --> 01:20:02,791
I mean what do I do really?

1232
01:20:03,500 --> 01:20:07,541
I came from humble beginnings, I understand
what these people are talking about.

1233
01:20:07,666 --> 01:20:10,458
It's not like I'm some rich
kid or some trust fund baby.

1234
01:20:10,833 --> 01:20:13,083
I worked my butt off for every dime I got.

1235
01:20:13,541 --> 01:20:14,708
I had to look after my mom.

1236
01:20:15,541 --> 01:20:18,708
So I just didn't wanna be
pulled down by my circumstances.

1237
01:20:18,833 --> 01:20:23,416
So I strived and used my gift audaciously.

1238
01:20:24,791 --> 01:20:26,708
Where am I supposed to be blamed for it.

1239
01:20:27,500 --> 01:20:32,875
So I take the odd picture of my toils, of
my achievement and I just wanna look good.

1240
01:20:33,333 --> 01:20:37,458
To let people understand that you can be anything
you want to be, if you strive for it. Uh huh.

1241
01:20:37,541 --> 01:20:38,708
Believe enough in it.

1242
01:20:39,500 --> 01:20:41,500
- So true.
- And then somebody decides

1243
01:20:42,375 --> 01:20:46,625
that I'm doing something so wrong, he makes a
career of making people like me miserable.

1244
01:20:47,333 --> 01:20:48,625
How does that play?

1245
01:20:49,333 --> 01:20:50,375
It's crazy.

1246
01:20:56,208 --> 01:20:57,500
Are you on social media?

1247
01:20:57,791 --> 01:20:59,291
Uh huh, twitter and instagram.

1248
01:21:00,208 --> 01:21:01,208
I see.

1249
01:21:02,583 --> 01:21:05,708
I suppose then that you know
some of the top bloggers.

1250
01:21:05,833 --> 01:21:09,583
Truth Hurts for instance.
[chuckles] Who doesn't know?

1251
01:21:10,208 --> 01:21:12,250
Everyone does know Truth Hurts.

1252
01:21:17,583 --> 01:21:21,250
Alright then, I also suppose
that you know a masquerade

1253
01:21:21,916 --> 01:21:28,500
Um if I catch you on the mainland, Ojuju.

1254
01:21:29,041 --> 01:21:32,125
- Yes we know all of them.
- You know Ojuju.

1255
01:21:32,500 --> 01:21:33,500
Yeah,

1256
01:21:35,041 --> 01:21:36,041
It's crazy.

1257
01:21:37,291 --> 01:21:41,500
So my question to you is what kind
of low life despicable creature

1258
01:21:41,791 --> 01:21:43,500
- hm,
- will make a career

1259
01:21:44,291 --> 01:21:46,875
of making other people,
I mean wake up in the morning

1260
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,958
literally dreaming about how to
destroy other people's lives.

1261
01:21:50,458 --> 01:21:52,541
You have to be the lowest of lows

1262
01:21:52,833 --> 01:21:55,375
Frank, people are angry.

1263
01:21:56,500 --> 01:21:57,500
They want your life.

1264
01:21:58,416 --> 01:22:01,333
They study, they work hard, you know...

1265
01:22:02,500 --> 01:22:06,208
they go out of their way to be everything
and still they settle for less.

1266
01:22:06,458 --> 01:22:09,625
And then some actor goes and
buys a whip of 50 million.

1267
01:22:10,166 --> 01:22:15,500
A footballer throws a wedding of 100 million, and
you expect them to say congratulations? [heh]

1268
01:22:15,583 --> 01:22:17,041
They'll say burn in hell.

1269
01:22:17,875 --> 01:22:22,541
You know. So just before you put
out that new endorsement deal.

1270
01:22:22,666 --> 01:22:24,541
Or that new whip that you bought,

1271
01:22:24,666 --> 01:22:28,083
Just know that half of your social
media followers, are not your fans.

1272
01:22:28,916 --> 01:22:32,556
They are frustrated people looking for how to
vent, and you are just their outlet, trust me.

1273
01:22:33,500 --> 01:22:34,500
[phone vibrates]
I see.

1274
01:22:39,125 --> 01:22:40,125
Frank.

1275
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:43,000
Frank.

1276
01:22:43,750 --> 01:22:44,750
Back to earth, I'm here.

1277
01:22:45,750 --> 01:22:48,000
Message received loud and clear, I'm here.

1278
01:22:48,375 --> 01:22:56,041
- Um, I have to go.
- You haven't even touched your food.

1279
01:22:56,416 --> 01:23:00,916
Hakeem is outside and I'm with
the key, so I need to go home now.

1280
01:23:01,375 --> 01:23:02,375
Hakeem the boyfriend?

1281
01:23:02,833 --> 01:23:05,166
[sighs] Hakeem is my brother.

1282
01:23:05,333 --> 01:23:06,958
And him and my mother had a fight.

1283
01:23:07,291 --> 01:23:08,958
So he's staying with me for a few days.

1284
01:23:11,291 --> 01:23:14,125
- Okay so, I'll..
- I just called my, I already called a cab.

1285
01:23:14,375 --> 01:23:16,125
Don't do that, cancel.

1286
01:23:16,500 --> 01:23:18,916
- No cancel seriously.
- It's off your route.

1287
01:23:19,875 --> 01:23:20,875
You are my route.

1288
01:23:21,166 --> 01:23:22,166
Heh.

1289
01:23:22,291 --> 01:23:24,291
Aunty Kaffy, I swear to god I tried.

1290
01:23:24,708 --> 01:23:27,166
If mum is telling the
truth, she'll say I tried.

1291
01:23:27,500 --> 01:23:30,833
I went to those interviews
mhen, jobs are useless.

1292
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:35,208
Okay so what about the
toyota we bought for you?

1293
01:23:38,541 --> 01:23:39,833
No Uber is beneath you.

1294
01:23:40,541 --> 01:23:43,500
Uncle Jemide's company, you
said he's too hard to work with.

1295
01:23:44,541 --> 01:23:48,375
Okay we said, look for an idea,
so we can add money for capital.

1296
01:23:48,500 --> 01:23:49,958
Hakeem till now, nothing.

1297
01:23:52,791 --> 01:23:55,431
Three months, that's all you have
in my house and I am not joking.

1298
01:23:59,375 --> 01:24:03,833
Frank please let me quickly go and change.

1299
01:24:04,250 --> 01:24:05,250
I'll be back.

1300
01:24:05,541 --> 01:24:07,458
- Where am I going to sleep?
- On my head.

1301
01:24:12,583 --> 01:24:16,708
So um, 6 months in kirikiri yh?

1302
01:24:18,250 --> 01:24:19,250
What was it like?

1303
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:21,500
She told you I was in prison?

1304
01:24:22,208 --> 01:24:23,875
There's nothing to be ashamed of.

1305
01:24:25,583 --> 01:24:27,500
It's a private family matter now.

1306
01:24:27,625 --> 01:24:29,500
Why does aunty Kaffy like to expose me?

1307
01:24:30,750 --> 01:24:31,958
She didn't mean it that way.

1308
01:24:32,083 --> 01:24:39,000
She said you were one of the 26 year olds
that were caught on Odolume street for fraud.

1309
01:24:39,750 --> 01:24:41,875
Mhen that's on TV, that's casting.

1310
01:24:42,500 --> 01:24:46,500
- Boss, you won't understand.
- Come on I do understand.

1311
01:24:46,583 --> 01:24:47,666
I really do.

1312
01:24:48,458 --> 01:24:51,333
See, this is not my real face.

1313
01:24:52,750 --> 01:24:55,708
And forget the professor look
and everything, we're both men.

1314
01:24:56,416 --> 01:24:58,250
Why don't we talk man to man or like men.

1315
01:25:04,458 --> 01:25:08,500
Growing up, you want to
get shit like that in Unilag.

1316
01:25:08,833 --> 01:25:11,833
I used to just find
something to push to school.

1317
01:25:12,333 --> 01:25:14,541
Making clothes, making shoes.

1318
01:25:14,958 --> 01:25:18,375
You know I started this yahoo
thing last year, after I graduated.

1319
01:25:18,625 --> 01:25:21,250
And under a few month,
I became Hakeem the hacker.

1320
01:25:21,416 --> 01:25:23,500
The don, the baddest.

1321
01:25:24,166 --> 01:25:27,083
My maga success ratio was 90%

1322
01:25:27,583 --> 01:25:30,083
you know bro, after a
few months, I bought benz

1323
01:25:30,333 --> 01:25:32,875
I bought prado, I rented a flat at Oniru.

1324
01:25:33,166 --> 01:25:37,166
I used to dash mum and dad money, even
Aunty Kaffy, I used to dash her money.

1325
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:41,041
Although I lied that it was a contract job.

1326
01:25:41,500 --> 01:25:43,000
But then I got busted.

1327
01:25:43,125 --> 01:25:44,708
They took me to Kirikiri.

1328
01:25:45,041 --> 01:25:49,125
Then since I came out, but..
Well I can understand.

1329
01:25:50,125 --> 01:25:53,708
One minute you're in the
Prados and Benzos, and then..

1330
01:25:53,833 --> 01:25:55,750
Hey that's actually a rhyme you know?

1331
01:25:56,416 --> 01:25:58,916
Well.
But you know..

1332
01:25:59,250 --> 01:26:02,833
When they started talking about Uber,
it didn't obviously sit well with you.

1333
01:26:02,958 --> 01:26:05,250
I swear to God bro, you get it.

1334
01:26:05,666 --> 01:26:06,666
This guy bam.

1335
01:26:06,916 --> 01:26:10,958
But you know Hakeem, being
on the straight and narrow

1336
01:26:11,333 --> 01:26:13,875
has it's rewards, you'll be
able to sleep well at night.

1337
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:15,000
With you eyes closed.

1338
01:26:15,583 --> 01:26:19,041
It may not make as much
money as yahoo, but you know

1339
01:26:19,750 --> 01:26:22,916
A kid as smart as you,
can be anything they want.

1340
01:26:23,583 --> 01:26:25,583
I swear to god bro, you're old.

1341
01:26:25,875 --> 01:26:30,291
This generation, it's either music or maga.

1342
01:26:30,416 --> 01:26:32,375
Nah but it doesn't work that way.

1343
01:26:32,958 --> 01:26:36,333
You spent 4 years paying your
way through school Hakeem.

1344
01:26:36,958 --> 01:26:38,718
That means you understand
what hard work is.

1345
01:26:39,541 --> 01:26:44,916
I'm telling you all you need to do is
get a proper job, stay on the street,

1346
01:26:45,958 --> 01:26:48,166
A kid as smart as you
will make it, eventually.

1347
01:26:48,875 --> 01:26:53,708
Bro let me tell you something,
this regular job vibes

1348
01:26:54,541 --> 01:26:58,541
My family would be happy, but me,
I'll be depressed.

1349
01:27:01,875 --> 01:27:04,958
Trust me Hakeem, we're
both in the same boat.

1350
01:27:07,208 --> 01:27:08,916
And I think I'll make you understand that.

1351
01:27:23,875 --> 01:27:27,750
- Boss! Frank Orji.
- Right.

1352
01:27:27,875 --> 01:27:29,750
- Mad oo
- I told you.

1353
01:27:30,500 --> 01:27:34,083
Aunty Kaffy, please come.
[laugh]

1354
01:27:36,083 --> 01:27:37,458
What is it? What's going on?

1355
01:27:37,583 --> 01:27:40,500
Your new ugly boyfriend is actually Frank.

1356
01:27:40,791 --> 01:27:41,833
Frank Orji.

1357
01:27:42,958 --> 01:27:43,958
I told you.

1358
01:27:44,125 --> 01:27:45,833
- Mad oo
- Is that why you were calling me?

1359
01:27:47,083 --> 01:27:49,208
Wow, you look gorgeous.

1360
01:27:51,958 --> 01:27:54,500
[Laughs]

1361
01:27:56,666 --> 01:27:58,875
Hey, look at you.

1362
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:03,500
How are you, you just having fun?
Come here. Hey.

1363
01:28:04,708 --> 01:28:05,708
He's just a kid.

1364
01:28:07,500 --> 01:28:08,500
Jezebel mom.

1365
01:28:08,583 --> 01:28:11,750
Nice one, I will holla at you alright.
Nice one boss.

1366
01:28:12,500 --> 01:28:14,083
- You got it?
- I got it.

1367
01:28:15,041 --> 01:28:16,083
Okay, wow.

1368
01:28:17,416 --> 01:28:18,416
So what's next?

1369
01:28:19,041 --> 01:28:23,458
I mean Boss, ever since you started talking
to Tasha, Ojuju has stopped posting.

1370
01:28:24,083 --> 01:28:25,458
I mean, doesn't that ring a bell?

1371
01:28:28,666 --> 01:28:33,750
I need a few days with her till I figure
this out. Everything will pan out.

1372
01:28:34,166 --> 01:28:35,833
Eventually, alright.

1373
01:28:36,625 --> 01:28:37,375
Few days.

1374
01:28:37,500 --> 01:28:45,500
[music]

1375
01:29:06,916 --> 01:29:07,916
[knocking]

1376
01:29:14,833 --> 01:29:15,833
[gasps]

1377

1401
01:31:08,916 --> 01:31:10,041
I honestly didn't get that.

1402
01:31:10,166 --> 01:31:12,083
Leave me alone.

1403

1417
01:32:03,875 --> 01:32:06,791
I'll have a word with
his manager or somebody.

1418
01:32:07,041 --> 01:32:09,208

Wow, well

1420
01:32:12,541 --> 01:32:14,708
That's my world in black and white.

1421
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:22,750
Now you understand why I pay top dollar for private spaces like this.
- Yes.

1422
01:32:24,541 --> 01:32:31,166
Yeah you become invisible to hostiles
but now the hostiles are insiders

1423
01:32:33,583 --> 01:32:35,541
You're accepting this
instead of fighting it.

1424
01:32:38,041 --> 01:32:39,041
Who do I fight?

1425
01:32:40,666 --> 01:32:42,333
Where do I start from?

1426
01:32:44,625 --> 01:32:46,125
I'm spiritually drained.

1427
01:32:48,666 --> 01:32:50,583
The world, I mean life is life.

1428
01:32:51,958 --> 01:32:53,541
People will be people.

1429
01:32:54,916 --> 01:32:56,541
I am who I am regardless.

1430
01:32:57,125 --> 01:33:02,500
No, I just decided to focus my
energy on something alot better.

1431
01:33:02,791 --> 01:33:06,958
Makes sense.
Hey listen, here, put it here.

1432
01:33:07,541 --> 01:33:12,125
[glasses clink]
To the good life and love.

1433
01:34:38,500 --> 01:34:46,500
[banter]

1434
01:34:52,541 --> 01:34:53,708
What's the problem?

1435
01:34:54,166 --> 01:34:55,708
There's trouble.

1436
01:34:58,541 --> 01:34:59,541
Boss.

1437
01:35:00,666 --> 01:35:08,666
Tasha Kafilat Adebayor, celebrated Basic 3
teacher, Is also the famed notorious troll, Ojuju.

1438
01:35:13,375 --> 01:35:18,291
Is also the secret lover of the disgraced,
violent, fallen Nollywood star, Frank Orji.

1439
01:35:21,791 --> 01:35:24,291
Boss, they even tagged
a video to this thing.

1440
01:35:31,666 --> 01:35:32,666
Truth Hurts

1441
01:35:39,916 --> 01:35:41,041
Boss what do we do?

1442
01:35:45,291 --> 01:35:46,291
Did you

1443
01:35:48,333 --> 01:35:56,333
by any chance, link Ojuju's
account to Tasha's IP address?

1444
01:35:57,875 --> 01:35:58,875
Sir.

1445
01:35:59,458 --> 01:36:00,791
All evidence points

1446
01:36:01,375 --> 01:36:02,791
that she is not Ojuju.

1447
01:36:04,541 --> 01:36:05,875
She can't be, it's not possible.

1448
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:07,000
Then find him!

1449
01:36:07,666 --> 01:36:08,666
I will.

1450
01:36:09,166 --> 01:36:13,583
But boss you know I have tried, this thing
is not easy, it's not a small matter.

1451
01:36:15,083 --> 01:36:16,958
- I've tried.
- I want this bastard.

1452
01:36:17,708 --> 01:36:19,666
This bastard is drowning me.

1453
01:36:19,791 --> 01:36:21,250
This person is drowning me.

1454
01:36:23,166 --> 01:36:26,958
- You have to find him.
- Boss, I have tried. This person's skill is mad.

1455
01:36:27,583 --> 01:36:31,303
This person is a hacker, it's not something I can
just hack This person knows what he's doing.

1456
01:36:31,416 --> 01:36:38,000
So what you're telling me, is that in this whole
universe, there's no hacker badder than this person?

1457
01:36:38,125 --> 01:36:40,958
Never, too many bad boys all over the net.

1458
01:36:41,083 --> 01:36:42,958
Fine let me speak a
language you understand.

1459
01:36:43,083 --> 01:36:47,625
2 million. Get me a hacker for 2 million

1460
01:36:47,750 --> 01:36:51,750
that will find Truth Hurts,
I want this person found in 24 hours.

1461
01:36:52,291 --> 01:36:53,291
Boss.

1462
01:36:54,916 --> 01:36:56,041
Boss.
Boss now.

1463
01:37:01,958 --> 01:37:03,000
You need

1464
01:37:03,416 --> 01:37:04,416
[alert]

1465
01:37:11,083 --> 01:37:12,791
That's your 2 million, I want that hacker.

1466
01:37:12,916 --> 01:37:14,708
Go. Get to it.

1467
01:37:15,083 --> 01:37:15,791
Alright boss.

1468
01:37:15,916 --> 01:37:16,916
Hey guys.

1469
01:37:22,791 --> 01:37:23,833
Oh God!

1470
01:37:27,333 --> 01:37:29,375
You should have kept this indoors.

1471
01:37:30,208 --> 01:37:34,708
I mean going out, going out to
eat, that's what caused this.

1472
01:37:38,958 --> 01:37:40,666
So she is Ojuju.

1473
01:37:50,875 --> 01:37:53,458
Yeah, bad guy, did you get my message?

1474
01:37:54,500 --> 01:37:59,375
[knocking]

1475
01:37:59,500 --> 01:38:03,250
[crying]
Frank, why are they doing this to me?

1476
01:38:03,458 --> 01:38:05,916
They almost cost me my job.

1477
01:38:06,250 --> 01:38:11,416
[crying profusely]

1478
01:38:43,125 --> 01:38:47,833
Because of my history, they suspended
me for 2 weeks but with pay.

1479
01:38:49,208 --> 01:38:51,000
Atleast they don't want to loose me.

1480
01:38:53,500 --> 01:38:57,833
But what I don't understand is why anyone
would think I'm a social media troll.

1481
01:38:58,250 --> 01:39:00,208
Like I don't even see the connection.

1482
01:39:07,875 --> 01:39:14,500
Um, what device do you
use for social media?

1483
01:39:16,125 --> 01:39:17,125
My phone.

1484
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:20,083
Yeah, but what way did you get the phone?

1485
01:39:21,250 --> 01:39:23,125
My cousin in England gave it to me.

1486
01:39:26,250 --> 01:39:27,250
Why?

1487
01:39:31,666 --> 01:39:33,125
It's no big deal, it's nothing.

1488
01:39:35,041 --> 01:39:37,833
I think you should come
over to mine for a few days.

1489
01:39:38,500 --> 01:39:40,208
Or atleast till this blows over.

1490
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:42,416
Just to look after you.

1491
01:39:42,583 --> 01:39:43,983
Protect you, make sure you're okay.

1492
01:39:48,458 --> 01:39:49,750
Everything is going to be fine.

1493
01:39:54,708 --> 01:39:56,291
[light chuckle]

1494
01:39:56,416 --> 01:39:58,375
[phone vibrating]

1495
01:40:07,375 --> 01:40:08,625
Hello Hilda.

1496
01:40:13,583 --> 01:40:14,583
What!

1497
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:23,458
Roma!
Is he gonna be okay?

1498
01:40:23,541 --> 01:40:27,250
Roma!
[car door jams]

1499
01:40:27,500 --> 01:40:28,500
Roma!

1500
01:40:29,958 --> 01:40:30,958
[dog barking]

1501
01:40:34,291 --> 01:40:35,291
Roma.

1502
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:38,750
What's going on?

1503
01:40:38,875 --> 01:40:40,166
I don't know..

1504
01:40:40,291 --> 01:40:42,267
[siren wailing]
What happened to him? I don't know.

1505
01:40:42,291 --> 01:40:44,166
I don't know.

1506
01:40:44,291 --> 01:40:47,500
[siren wailing]

1507
01:40:49,375 --> 01:40:50,434
What do you mean you don't know?

1508
01:40:50,458 --> 01:40:52,333
He just... he just collapsed.

1509
01:40:52,458 --> 01:40:55,208
Sir I don't know what happened [stuttering]

1510
01:40:55,333 --> 01:40:56,333
I don't know.

1511
01:40:56,833 --> 01:40:57,916
Tasha is outed.

1512
01:40:58,666 --> 01:41:00,541
The old man saga is dredged

1513
01:41:01,250 --> 01:41:02,541
and Roma falls ill.

1514
01:41:05,166 --> 01:41:11,583
No, no no honestly, all of these,
all these feels very very connected.

1515
01:41:15,791 --> 01:41:16,791
I don't care.

1516
01:41:18,416 --> 01:41:21,083
I'm just really concerned
about everyone around me.

1517
01:41:22,416 --> 01:41:23,875
Obviously, we're being targeted.

1518
01:41:26,041 --> 01:41:28,500
I need you guys to be really careful.

1519
01:41:31,041 --> 01:41:33,000
I want you guys to give me some room.

1520
01:41:34,333 --> 01:41:37,375
I need atleast a 40 foot
distance away from me

1521
01:41:39,666 --> 01:41:40,666
Who is next?

1522
01:41:40,875 --> 01:41:42,750
Everybody around me is getting destroyed.

1523
01:41:45,041 --> 01:41:46,041
Okay you know what?

1524
01:41:47,083 --> 01:41:48,291
I'm gonna run you a hot bath

1525
01:41:50,250 --> 01:41:51,875
to get you out of this funky mood.

1526
01:41:52,666 --> 01:41:53,875
Alright.

1527
01:42:13,291 --> 01:42:16,708
[phone ringing]

1528
01:42:16,958 --> 01:42:18,708
[sighs]

1529
01:42:19,791 --> 01:42:24,250
Hello.
Boss I did it. 200k. I did it bro.

1530
01:42:24,708 --> 01:42:25,708
Did what?

1531
01:42:26,583 --> 01:42:32,000
You said if I can get a job and make up to
200k, you'll double it for me to invest.

1532
01:42:32,458 --> 01:42:33,458
What did you do?

1533
01:42:33,791 --> 01:42:35,375
It's Uber.

1534
01:42:35,500 --> 01:42:40,125
You know I figured if I stay level headed, I
should be able to make something big out of it.

1535
01:42:40,500 --> 01:42:41,500
I'm proud of you.

1536
01:42:44,500 --> 01:42:46,583
Send your account details,
Ill do the rest yeah.

1537
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:52,875
Boss don't worry, if I can do 200k,
I'm sure I can do better than this.

1538
01:42:53,500 --> 01:43:00,416
Infact, I heard of this HWO
foundation, let me see how it goes.

1539
01:43:00,500 --> 01:43:06,125
Sounds good, I've heard good things about it. I
hear they're really empowering young entrepreneurs.

1540
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:08,200
I think you should take it up.

1541
01:43:09,250 --> 01:43:10,250
Proud of you mhen.

1542
01:43:10,416 --> 01:43:18,208
Yes Boss, with this slow and steady process, I can
sleep with both eyes closed and that's the main thing.

1543
01:43:18,833 --> 01:43:21,208
This is amazing, You're
a great guy you know.

1544
01:43:22,791 --> 01:43:24,458
You just needed perspective.

1545
01:43:25,708 --> 01:43:27,583
Atleast something good came out of me.

1546
01:43:28,291 --> 01:43:29,958
I don't understand Boss.

1547
01:43:30,375 --> 01:43:34,041
Well you heard what happened
to your sister because of me.

1548
01:43:35,375 --> 01:43:36,375
Are you Truth Hurts?

1549
01:43:37,500 --> 01:43:38,500
No man.

1550
01:43:38,666 --> 01:43:41,125
That guy has been attacking
me and everything I do.

1551
01:43:42,666 --> 01:43:44,166
Trying to destroy me

1552
01:43:44,833 --> 01:43:45,833
at every turn.

1553
01:43:46,791 --> 01:43:50,708
He somehow dragged Tasha into this.
He's trying to bring her down.

1554
01:43:51,791 --> 01:43:54,708
Mad people have done everything
to break his firewall but

1555
01:43:55,541 --> 01:43:57,666
He just didn't bend to... I just

1556
01:43:57,791 --> 01:44:00,151
Boss why didn't you tell me
you're looking for Truth Hurts?

1557
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:05,958
Listen, Hakeem I really appreciate
your offering to help but

1558
01:44:06,541 --> 01:44:12,375
My brother this is not the regular yahoo
yahoo thing. This is deep stuff mhen

1559
01:44:12,500 --> 01:44:14,458
Security cyber stuff mhen.

1560
01:44:14,541 --> 01:44:16,375
It's way beyond your skill set.

1561
01:44:16,500 --> 01:44:18,833
You've forgotten it's
me, Hakeem the baddest.

1562
01:44:19,500 --> 01:44:23,500
Boss I graduated from Unilag
with a 2.1 in computer science.

1563
01:44:23,916 --> 01:44:28,208
And all these yahooing was because I was
a commander in Supreme Blackhat Hacking.

1564
01:44:28,375 --> 01:44:29,625
Boss, I'm good.

1565
01:44:30,166 --> 01:44:33,041
- That one is small, I will find him.
- You can find him?

1566
01:44:33,208 --> 01:44:36,166
Common social media troll, I will find him.

1567
01:44:36,458 --> 01:44:39,500
- You sure?
- Smallest, Boss

1568
01:44:39,708 --> 01:44:45,458
I will do it, infact I have a request right now Boss. Let me call you back.
- Okay.

1569
01:44:45,541 --> 01:44:47,500
Okay Hakeem [line clicks]

1570
01:45:07,750 --> 01:45:09,791
No way, you have to be kidding me.

1571
01:45:10,500 --> 01:45:12,220
You're the one that has been outing trolls?

1572
01:45:14,166 --> 01:45:15,166
Yes.

1573
01:45:18,166 --> 01:45:21,041
So what, you came after me
because you thought I was Ojuju.

1574
01:45:22,541 --> 01:45:23,541
Apparently.

1575
01:45:28,875 --> 01:45:31,000
Listen, I understand your frustration.

1576
01:45:32,083 --> 01:45:35,625
But given the situation then,
I had to take drastic measures.

1577
01:45:36,541 --> 01:45:39,333
So I brought onboard some of
the best minds in the game.

1578
01:45:39,750 --> 01:45:41,000
And we did what they do

1579
01:45:42,291 --> 01:45:46,625
We traced the IP Address of every
troll, linked it to their email

1580
01:45:46,833 --> 01:45:48,750
subsequently, their address.

1581
01:45:49,958 --> 01:45:52,541
And then of course we ended
up at a certain device.

1582
01:45:53,666 --> 01:45:56,208
Now the device in question that you posses

1583
01:45:57,041 --> 01:46:01,041
was the device Ojuju uses to
troll people, especially me.

1584
01:46:01,625 --> 01:46:04,000
But I told you that it was
my cousin that gave it to me.

1585
01:46:04,375 --> 01:46:05,375
And I believe you.

1586
01:46:06,500 --> 01:46:08,500
Okay so what are you going
to do to my cousin now?

1587
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:11,000
Nothing.

1588
01:46:13,666 --> 01:46:14,958
If for anything,

1589
01:46:15,625 --> 01:46:16,625
the fight

1590
01:46:17,750 --> 01:46:20,291
has been drained out of me since I met you.

1591
01:46:22,083 --> 01:46:23,750
And that's why I decided to end it.

1592
01:46:25,625 --> 01:46:27,208
I've decided to end this operation

1593
01:46:28,875 --> 01:46:29,875
because

1594
01:46:34,250 --> 01:46:35,333
I found you.

1595
01:46:36,416 --> 01:46:37,416
No really.

1596
01:46:39,708 --> 01:46:40,708
[slap]

1597
01:46:42,708 --> 01:46:43,791
What was that for?

1598
01:46:45,166 --> 01:46:46,500
Because now I'm in love with you.

1599
01:46:48,958 --> 01:46:50,000
Come here.

1600
01:46:52,541 --> 01:46:54,125
Come on, please.

1601
01:46:55,750 --> 01:46:56,750
Please.

1602
01:47:03,500 --> 01:47:04,500
I love you too.

1603
01:47:12,291 --> 01:47:14,750
Get a room guys, there's 7 of us here.

1604
01:47:16,125 --> 01:47:17,416
One second Hilda.

1605
01:47:18,208 --> 01:47:20,208
- You know what we need?
- Yes Boss.

1606
01:47:20,791 --> 01:47:21,791
Pizza.

1607
01:47:22,500 --> 01:47:26,375
You got Boss.
With extra cheese for the lovely lady.

1608
01:47:26,583 --> 01:47:32,708
Okay, so please, pepperoni for me
as usual and anything really good.

1609
01:47:32,833 --> 01:47:35,750
- Alright, let's go. Chop chop.
- Alright.

1610
01:47:36,208 --> 01:47:37,750
[exhales]

1611
01:47:46,625 --> 01:47:47,875
Me Hakeem.

1612
01:47:49,125 --> 01:47:50,125
Baddest.

1613
01:47:50,500 --> 01:47:51,500
[tuts]

1614
01:47:55,208 --> 01:47:56,500
Oh shit!

1615
01:48:04,291 --> 01:48:08,291
[tapping]
[engiene revs]

1616
01:48:09,541 --> 01:48:10,916
[dialing]

1617
01:48:13,416 --> 01:48:16,541
The customer you're dialing is busy
Boss pick now [tuts]

1618
01:48:23,375 --> 01:48:24,791
fucking hell.

1619
01:48:38,125 --> 01:48:41,583
[leaves rustling]

1620
01:48:47,041 --> 01:48:49,250
[car zooms]

1621
01:48:59,666 --> 01:49:00,666
Babe,

1622
01:49:01,208 --> 01:49:02,250
pizza's here.

1623
01:49:02,791 --> 01:49:05,125
- Oou
- set it up

1624
01:49:06,708 --> 01:49:11,291
- okay
- hmm, smells nice already.

1625
01:49:11,416 --> 01:49:13,291
Oh I know.
Alright.

1626
01:49:13,416 --> 01:49:14,750
- Dig in baby
- uh huh.

1627
01:49:18,083 --> 01:49:18,916
Hol up.

1628
01:49:19,041 --> 01:49:23,000
Just a second, I have
something to tell you.

1629
01:49:24,041 --> 01:49:26,416
Now something amazing
happened while you were away.

1630
01:49:28,333 --> 01:49:31,208
- No, Frank!
- Yes.

1631
01:49:31,500 --> 01:49:33,180
I popped the big question.
[excited squeal]

1632
01:49:33,250 --> 01:49:38,666
Look at that, got bling in it.
Look at this one, haha it will blind you.

1633
01:49:38,916 --> 01:49:41,958
- I love it babe.
- You deserve more. Aw

1634
01:49:42,083 --> 01:49:45,500
Now listen, I know I've not
known her for that long.

1635
01:49:45,791 --> 01:49:48,250
But, this one is for me.

1636
01:49:48,458 --> 01:49:49,208
Babe stop.

1637
01:49:49,333 --> 01:49:51,250
[laughing and kissing]

1638
01:49:51,416 --> 01:49:55,333
Wow!

1639
01:49:55,500 --> 01:49:57,166
We should celebrate.

1640
01:49:57,291 --> 01:49:58,750
I know right.

1641
01:49:58,875 --> 01:50:01,458
- Don't I have the best PA in the whole world?
- Yes!

1642
01:50:01,541 --> 01:50:05,208
Okay you grab the crystal,
I'll grab the glasses.

1643
01:50:05,333 --> 01:50:07,291
Quite right.

1644
01:50:07,500 --> 01:50:11,291
[glass clinking]

1645
01:50:16,708 --> 01:50:17,708
Alright.

1646
01:50:18,666 --> 01:50:20,166
Congratulations. [he he]

1647
01:50:20,291 --> 01:50:22,166
Thank [laughs lightly]

1648
01:50:22,291 --> 01:50:24,166
- Yeah
- Babe you need to taste this.

1649
01:50:24,291 --> 01:50:26,708
Oh for real, uh huh.

1650
01:50:28,416 --> 01:50:30,666
[mindful eating]

1651
01:50:30,791 --> 01:50:37,083
- uh, it's so good. It's amazing.
- Open that you mouth, it's amazing right?

1652
01:50:37,416 --> 01:50:38,666
This is amazing babe.

1653
01:50:38,791 --> 01:50:43,083
It's incomparable The best

1654
01:50:44,750 --> 01:50:46,017
You need to grab a piece of this.

1655
01:50:46,041 --> 01:50:49,916
Grab a piece.
Trust me on this one

1656
01:50:50,041 --> 01:50:52,000
It is to die for.

1657
01:50:54,291 --> 01:50:59,333
Interesting choice of words, Frank Orji.

1658
01:51:09,458 --> 01:51:10,500
What's going on

1659
01:51:11,750 --> 01:51:12,750
Well.

1660
01:51:14,208 --> 01:51:21,500
Frank Orji and his
beautiful, pretty, lovely

1661
01:51:21,666 --> 01:51:22,750
Bitch!

1662
01:51:23,750 --> 01:51:25,583
Are having a last supper.

1663
01:51:27,583 --> 01:51:31,458
[groaning]

1664
01:51:31,541 --> 01:51:33,541
arrrrgh, oh!

1665
01:51:35,750 --> 01:51:37,333
I forgot to tell you.

1666
01:51:38,083 --> 01:51:39,500
The pizza

1667
01:51:40,125 --> 01:51:44,416
The pizza came with a generous portion

1668
01:51:45,208 --> 01:51:46,416
of arsenic

1669
01:51:46,583 --> 01:51:47,625
[loud groan]

1670
01:51:47,750 --> 01:51:51,208
thickly marinated and seasoned

1671
01:51:52,333 --> 01:51:54,375
in some cheese please.

1672
01:51:55,166 --> 01:51:59,000
[evil laugh]

1673
01:52:01,375 --> 01:52:03,791
oh guys stop, stop.

1674
01:52:04,291 --> 01:52:05,500
Don't worry [groaning]

1675
01:52:06,500 --> 01:52:09,666
you still have a few minutes
to say your last prayers.

1676
01:52:10,625 --> 01:52:12,291
[ahhhhhh]
[groaning in pain]

1677
01:52:12,416 --> 01:52:14,333
[laughs]
[groaning in pain]

1678
01:52:20,166 --> 01:52:22,333
Why?

1679
01:52:22,458 --> 01:52:28,750
Well because you are a
pathologically ignoramus bastard!

1680
01:52:28,958 --> 01:52:30,166
Frank Orji.

1681
01:52:30,958 --> 01:52:31,958
Ah

1682
01:52:35,291 --> 01:52:40,291
Do these, look like movie props?

1683
01:52:40,958 --> 01:52:48,125
Does this look like a film costume?

1684
01:52:48,250 --> 01:52:50,208
[groaning]

1685
01:52:50,416 --> 01:52:52,208
For 2 years.

1686
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:55,916
2 long years

1687
01:52:56,041 --> 01:52:59,000
I invested in makeup

1688
01:52:59,125 --> 01:53:04,625
and hair dos, and dresses,
and facials, and fragrances.

1689
01:53:05,291 --> 01:53:09,458
Only for me to be rewarded with words

1690
01:53:10,708 --> 01:53:13,125
How do you repay my efforts?

1691
01:53:14,583 --> 01:53:19,708
You fall in love with Trasha

1692
01:53:19,833 --> 01:53:21,750
Frank Orji.

1693
01:53:23,375 --> 01:53:24,375
[sighs deeply

1694
01:53:26,875 --> 01:53:28,875
Frank Orji.

1695
01:53:29,750 --> 01:53:32,166
Arrrgh, the flings!

1696
01:53:32,291 --> 01:53:35,666
And the dates, the one
night stands, the sex!

1697
01:53:35,875 --> 01:53:38,000
The flings, the dates, the one night stands

1698
01:53:38,125 --> 01:53:40,041
the flings, the dates, the sex!

1699
01:53:40,166 --> 01:53:43,291
The one night stands, all very

1700
01:53:43,416 --> 01:53:44,625
forgiveable.

1701
01:53:44,750 --> 01:53:47,583
And understandable.

1702
01:53:48,416 --> 01:53:50,583
Because you're a man.

1703
01:53:51,541 --> 01:53:55,708
And every man has that gene, that gene

1704
01:53:56,041 --> 01:53:57,708
That fuck boy gene!

1705
01:53:58,333 --> 01:53:59,708
Frank Orji

1706
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:06,500
I was supposed to be your queen.

1707
01:54:06,583 --> 01:54:12,083
[breathing hard]
I was supposed to be the one on top

1708
01:54:12,916 --> 01:54:14,875
but you know what you did?

1709
01:54:18,041 --> 01:54:23,375
You find some nobody, from God knows where

1710
01:54:23,500 --> 01:54:26,500
who has the online Monica of Ojuju

1711
01:54:26,583 --> 01:54:31,291
oh Frank Orji how, how
could you stoop so low?

1712
01:54:31,416 --> 01:54:33,291
Frank Orji

1713
01:54:36,750 --> 01:54:38,208
[sucks teeth]

1714
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:41,000
It was you.

1715
01:54:43,125 --> 01:54:44,125
Roma

1716
01:54:46,875 --> 01:54:49,083
Roma?

1717
01:54:51,333 --> 01:54:52,333
Roma

1718
01:55:07,666 --> 01:55:08,666
Roma

1719
01:55:09,333 --> 01:55:10,958
Roma

1720
01:55:11,083 --> 01:55:11,791
Yes!

1721
01:55:11,916 --> 01:55:15,625
Roma almost discovered who I was.

1722
01:55:16,375 --> 01:55:17,875
He was this close

1723
01:55:19,208 --> 01:55:20,958
so he had to go.

1724
01:55:23,458 --> 01:55:24,458
[shouts]

1725
01:55:33,250 --> 01:55:35,875
[struggling to speak]

1726
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:36,666
what?

1727
01:55:36,791 --> 01:55:39,833
[gasping and groaning]

1728
01:55:40,916 --> 01:55:42,000
Truth Hurts

1729
01:55:43,208 --> 01:55:44,541
Truth hurts

1730
01:55:44,666 --> 01:55:48,166
Yes Frank Orji

1731
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:51,250
Truth Hurts

1732
01:55:53,375 --> 01:55:54,875
It does doesn't it?

1733
01:56:03,208 --> 01:56:06,333
Frank Orji, the truth hurts

1734
01:56:06,458 --> 01:56:09,708
and the truth always wins

1735
01:56:11,166 --> 01:56:19,166
why?
Well, Frank Orji.

1736
01:56:22,125 --> 01:56:30,125
Oh why?
Questions of life why

1737
01:56:32,375 --> 01:56:40,375
Frank Orji. I came into this
entertainment industry for a career.

1738
01:56:40,833 --> 01:56:45,083
And all I kept getting
offered were times in bed

1739
01:56:46,125 --> 01:56:50,916
So up close and personal I
realized and I discovered

1740
01:56:51,750 --> 01:56:54,125
that it was all a facade

1741
01:56:54,333 --> 01:56:56,541
it was all bullshit.

1742
01:56:57,666 --> 01:57:05,166
Frank Orji

1743
01:57:05,291 --> 01:57:06,416
You were good.

1744
01:57:06,500 --> 01:57:10,583
- Fix yourself
- and different

1745
01:57:11,958 --> 01:57:15,583
and you took my opinions on board.

1746
01:57:17,375 --> 01:57:24,208
And I was falling in love with you.
And we would have been perfect together.

1747
01:57:24,333 --> 01:57:32,333
Frank Orji, did you know how many hours
of video footage I have of you Frank Orji?

1748
01:57:46,708 --> 01:57:48,583
Ah

1749
01:58:09,500 --> 01:58:15,875
I am not interested in Hilda
like that, she's a proficient PA.

1750
01:58:23,208 --> 01:58:25,458
You needed to be punished.

1751
01:58:26,166 --> 01:58:30,166
Humbled, Frank Orji.

1752
01:58:32,333 --> 01:58:36,791
You were supposed to hit
rock bottom, loose everything

1753
01:58:37,833 --> 01:58:41,625
Your friends, your career,
your love, everything.

1754
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:51,000
And then someone was supposed to bring
you right out of all that mess, not her!

1755
01:58:54,625 --> 01:58:55,625
Me.

1756
01:59:02,875 --> 01:59:06,500
The glory would have been all mine.

1757
01:59:08,041 --> 01:59:09,041
All

1758
01:59:28,791 --> 01:59:36,666
- Victory is mine, Victory is mine
- What happened to them?

1759
01:59:36,791 --> 01:59:39,666
Oh my gosh! yes,

1760
01:59:39,791 --> 01:59:43,541
[stuttering] I came in and
I found them on the floor.

1761
01:59:43,666 --> 01:59:47,875
You know what I think happened
I think she poisoned him

1762
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:50,875
and then she poisoned herself.

1763
01:59:53,291 --> 01:59:54,791
Wait, who are you?

1764
01:59:57,375 --> 02:00:03,500
My friend
And my brother. Boss.

1765
02:00:04,458 --> 02:00:07,041
Yes. We got everything
Good job.

1766
02:00:09,708 --> 02:00:10,708
Baddest guy!

1767
02:00:16,416 --> 02:00:18,666
Wait, what is going on?

1768
02:00:18,791 --> 02:00:22,333
What is going on is that
we've been on to you from day 1.

1769
02:00:23,208 --> 02:00:28,708
You see, when Roma slumped
I knew something was happening.

1770
02:00:29,666 --> 02:00:35,708
And of course, the hospital chalked
his condition to high blood pressure.

1771
02:00:36,458 --> 02:00:43,500
I mean he had no pre condition like that, neither
did he have any family history in that state.

1772
02:00:44,250 --> 02:00:50,000
I thought something was really
amiss, so we dug deeper.

1773
02:00:50,291 --> 02:00:56,416
I took the pack of juice Roma had and
sent it to the lab and had it checked out.

1774
02:00:56,500 --> 02:01:01,375
And it was laced with a
high dose of adrenaline

1775
02:01:02,875 --> 02:01:04,416
exactly

1776
02:01:05,541 --> 02:01:10,875
So I decided to dig even deeper.
At first I suspected my friend here

1777
02:01:15,291 --> 02:01:19,125
After that, Hakeem and my
girlfriend came into the picture.

1778
02:01:19,250 --> 02:01:24,125
Hilda Wakama, your manager,
Boss I assessed her video files

1779
02:01:24,333 --> 02:01:27,333
This babe is the girlfriend of the devil.

1780
02:01:27,500 --> 02:01:29,250
Wild stuff that you've done in the past

1781
02:01:32,041 --> 02:01:35,291
I couldn't believe that is the same
person I've been with all this years.

1782
02:01:35,416 --> 02:01:39,583
Hakeem the baddest, no
1 cyber guy, trust me.

1783
02:01:40,250 --> 02:01:42,250
And that's where the die was cast

1784
02:01:44,875 --> 02:01:49,083
So, we took it a step further

1785
02:01:49,208 --> 02:01:52,125
Get a room guys, there's 7 of us here

1786
02:01:52,250 --> 02:01:55,416
You know what we need? Yes boss

1787
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:05,416
How long will she take? I'm on my way.

1788
02:02:05,958 --> 02:02:10,416
And my dear your performance
this afternoon was stellar.

1789
02:02:10,500 --> 02:02:13,666
And yours was oscar worthy.

1790
02:02:15,791 --> 02:02:18,041
Ah, you still have a few minutes.

1791
02:02:18,166 --> 02:02:21,583
To say your last prayers.

1792
02:02:24,333 --> 02:02:27,000
Honestly we didn't
expect that speech drama.

1793
02:02:27,125 --> 02:02:30,405
We were really amazed at how much drama
and how much confession you gave us today.

1794
02:02:36,666 --> 02:02:42,958
We switched it, you see that whole
moment where I asked to get the crystal.

1795
02:02:43,083 --> 02:02:44,958
Yes we switched it.

1796
02:02:45,208 --> 02:02:51,333
And then before then, she toasted some
bread to disguise the aroma of the pizza

1797
02:02:51,458 --> 02:02:53,375
walking in, you would not suspect

1798
02:02:55,083 --> 02:03:01,500
Baby, Pizza is here... oou. And you
know how we know you poisoned the pizza?

1799
02:03:02,250 --> 02:03:08,041
We had Tornado follow you all through,
that is how we found out who you truly are.

1800
02:03:10,041 --> 02:03:18,041
You know what, You know what the
difference between you and me

1801
02:03:21,291 --> 02:03:23,625
Is that I'm not well.
I'm not well.

1802
02:03:24,416 --> 02:03:28,041
I have experience doing
really bad things, okay

1803
02:03:28,166 --> 02:03:32,375
So what's going to happen is you're going
to give me everything that you have on me.

1804
02:03:32,500 --> 02:03:33,500
Everything.

1805
02:03:33,541 --> 02:03:39,000
And then I'm going to walk out of here.
And it'll be my word against yours.

1806
02:03:39,125 --> 02:03:43,583
Well it's not exactly that easy.

1807
02:03:43,708 --> 02:03:48,166
Because you're on live cam,
to start with my friend

1808
02:03:49,041 --> 02:03:51,500
recording her was brilliant,

1809
02:03:51,625 --> 02:03:55,791
but having her on live is the grand feed.
Instagram live.

1810
02:03:56,625 --> 02:04:00,375
Was absolutely spectacular,

1811
02:04:00,500 --> 02:04:01,583
Move to the left

1812
02:04:02,166 --> 02:04:03,583
Right, small small

1813
02:04:03,833 --> 02:04:06,458
Yeah yeah, chill now.
Yeah it's alright.

1814
02:04:10,500 --> 02:04:12,583
Move yeah it's alright.

1815
02:04:14,208 --> 02:04:17,500
Yeah say hi to the world bitch.
Shit!

1816
02:04:17,625 --> 02:04:20,166
On live cam? ehen.

1817
02:04:20,291 --> 02:04:21,333
Shit

1818
02:04:33,291 --> 02:04:35,083
Yeah get her Tornado, get her!

1819
02:04:48,916 --> 02:04:50,500
It was on this seat

1820
02:04:51,291 --> 02:04:52,500
5 months ago

1821
02:04:55,125 --> 02:04:59,125
that I lied and slandered my fellow man.

1822
02:05:02,500 --> 02:05:04,125
His name is Frank

1823
02:05:05,791 --> 02:05:06,791
Orji

1824
02:05:10,708 --> 02:05:12,750
It was the devil's work.

1825
02:05:16,375 --> 02:05:17,666
I needed money.

1826
02:05:20,583 --> 02:05:23,958
A lady, Hilda, gave me money.

1827
02:05:30,166 --> 02:05:32,041
The devil pushed her

1828
02:05:34,708 --> 02:05:36,250
and she pushed me.

1829
02:05:37,958 --> 02:05:39,708
And we'll pay double for all the trouble.

1830
02:05:44,166 --> 02:05:46,291
Well, double sounds good.

1831
02:05:47,166 --> 02:05:49,125
Thank you, Mr onevick

1832
02:05:52,500 --> 02:05:54,875
Frank that we know, heh

1833
02:05:55,208 --> 02:05:57,916
To think that Frank will
do such a thing to that man

1834
02:05:58,458 --> 02:06:03,958
or even anybody else, no we stood
by him all the way, we had his back.

1835
02:06:04,833 --> 02:06:10,333
You see this life is just somehow, you know
People misunderstand people.

1836
02:06:11,041 --> 02:06:16,000
I always knew you know, Frank.
I always knew he was innocent, maybe I..

1837
02:06:16,875 --> 02:06:18,125
For everyone of you

1838
02:06:20,708 --> 02:06:22,041
that have lost something.

1839
02:06:24,250 --> 02:06:25,250
Either a job,

1840
02:06:26,333 --> 02:06:27,333
a relationship,

1841
02:06:28,625 --> 02:06:29,708
a house,

1842
02:06:32,333 --> 02:06:33,541
I've arranged a bailout.

1843
02:06:37,708 --> 02:06:39,875
I'll give each one of you a better job,

1844
02:06:41,083 --> 02:06:42,083
a better home,

1845
02:06:43,791 --> 02:06:45,083
the companies that I took,

1846
02:06:46,791 --> 02:06:50,083
underneath your feet will reabsorb you.

1847
02:06:51,166 --> 02:06:52,541
We'll move you into better homes.

1848
02:06:53,500 --> 02:06:55,500
I have done this for posterity.

1849
02:06:56,416 --> 02:06:58,083
Now you replicate,

1850
02:06:58,208 --> 02:07:01,583
by going out there helping people
with the power and skill you have.

1851
02:07:02,166 --> 02:07:06,000
Your mind and your device is for
lifting and for pulling down.

1852
02:07:11,500 --> 02:07:14,291
Thank you very much for your time sirs.

1853
02:07:14,625 --> 02:07:18,416
Bio medical waste
management is big business.

1854
02:07:18,500 --> 02:07:21,250
One that a lot of people
have not taken time to study.

1855
02:07:21,375 --> 02:07:25,958
Fortunately I have, and my
findings are quite interesting.

1856
02:07:26,375 --> 02:07:31,875
In a few seconds, I will use
this chat to juxtapose the ratio

1857
02:07:32,458 --> 02:07:33,916
in demand with..

1858
02:07:35,250 --> 02:07:40,500
Ah good day sir, here is the presentation for
the bio medical waste management project.

1859
02:07:40,958 --> 02:07:45,250
Sorry this is..
and erm, this is the introduction.

1860
02:07:45,708 --> 02:07:48,750
Leave introduction first,
scroll down to the budget

1861
02:07:48,875 --> 02:07:50,833
Oh, the budget, okay

1862
02:07:52,458 --> 02:07:54,000
Here is the budget.

1863
02:07:55,416 --> 02:07:57,583
- How much is this?
- 55 million sir.

1864
02:07:59,500 --> 02:08:03,625
What do I want to do with 55 million?

1865
02:08:06,875 --> 02:08:10,291
Sir 55 million is the exact amount
you need to execute this project.

1866
02:08:12,500 --> 02:08:17,166
Sharp, put 200 million.
Once I collect my 200 million cash

1867
02:08:17,291 --> 02:08:20,500
I will give you 10 million. And me I'm off.

Good afternoon sirs, I'm Hakeem Adebayor.

I'm here to share my
revolutionary new software.

1884
02:09:20,500 --> 02:09:24,375
For heightened cyber security.
Sounds interesting.
