1
00:01:07,829 --> 00:01:12,702
Venus, my Venus, Venus

2
00:01:13,207 --> 00:01:18,672
Venus, my Venus, Venus

3
00:01:19,082 --> 00:01:24,324
Venus, my Venus, Venus

4
00:01:24,718 --> 00:01:29,889
Venus, my Venus, Venus

5
00:01:30,089 --> 00:01:32,927
Started out on the horizon

6
00:01:33,297 --> 00:01:35,473
Then it grew to be a siren

7
00:01:35,784 --> 00:01:38,445
I'm a fire and I'm coming undone

8
00:01:38,638 --> 00:01:40,876
It's so beautiful now I'm crying

9
00:01:41,411 --> 00:01:44,211
Thought that love was
made for someone else,

10
00:01:44,475 --> 00:01:46,455
but you have changed me

11
00:01:46,730 --> 00:01:51,700
My body and my mind agree
that you have rearranged me

12
00:01:51,977 --> 00:01:54,153
Oh, Venus

13
00:01:54,414 --> 00:01:59,685
Like a supernova, I can't stop
this overwhelming feeling

14
00:01:59,917 --> 00:02:05,945
You got me falling in love and
everybody here can see us

15
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:09,120
My world is upside down

16
00:02:09,331 --> 00:02:11,486
Oh, Venus

17
00:02:12,325 --> 00:02:15,256
You turn my heart around

18
00:02:26,589 --> 00:02:29,132
I couldn't love 'til you arrived

19
00:02:29,466 --> 00:02:31,996
Now I'm living with
the bluer skies

20
00:02:32,332 --> 00:02:34,850
I shouldn't laugh,
shouldn't be surprised

21
00:02:35,103 --> 00:02:37,265
It's what you do,
and you do it right

22
00:02:37,594 --> 00:02:40,786
Thought that love was
made for someone else,

23
00:02:41,023 --> 00:02:42,630
but you have changed me

24
00:02:43,224 --> 00:02:48,237
My body and my mind agree
that you have rearranged me

25
00:02:48,518 --> 00:02:50,592
Oh, Venus

26
00:02:50,904 --> 00:02:56,002
Like a supernova, I can't stop
this overwhelming feeling

27
00:02:56,344 --> 00:03:01,957
You got me falling in love and
everybody here can see us

28
00:03:02,683 --> 00:03:05,509
My world is upside down

29
00:03:05,721 --> 00:03:07,956
Oh, Venus

30
00:03:08,907 --> 00:03:11,521
You turn my heart around

31
00:03:12,266 --> 00:03:17,232
Venus, my Venus, my

32
00:03:17,664 --> 00:03:22,658
Venus, my Venus, Venus

33
00:03:24,091 --> 00:03:29,305
Now I understand
what it is to fly

34
00:03:29,667 --> 00:03:35,333
To dive in deep with someone
for more the just a night

35
00:03:35,701 --> 00:03:39,892
Now I understand what
love songs really mean

36
00:03:40,035 --> 00:03:42,085
Two bodies into one

37
00:03:42,363 --> 00:03:44,805
Two minds into a dream

38
00:03:45,001 --> 00:03:47,358
Oh, Venus

39
00:03:47,555 --> 00:03:52,527
Like a supernova, I can't stop
this overwhelming feeling

40
00:03:52,863 --> 00:03:58,799
You got me falling in love and
everybody here can see us

41
00:03:59,295 --> 00:04:01,700
My world is upside down

42
00:04:02,187 --> 00:04:05,168
Oh, Venus, mm-mm

43
00:04:05,427 --> 00:04:07,990
You turn my heart around

44
00:04:08,187 --> 00:04:09,577
Venus

45
00:04:09,913 --> 00:04:14,775
Like a supernova, I can't stop
this overwhelming feeling

46
00:04:15,468 --> 00:04:21,017
You got me falling in love and
everybody here can see us

47
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:24,478
My world is upside down

48
00:04:24,779 --> 00:04:27,545
Oh, Venus, mm-mm

49
00:04:27,908 --> 00:04:33,484
You turn my heart around

50
00:04:51,974 --> 00:04:55,670
I didn't know that I
could want you so deep

51
00:04:56,132 --> 00:04:59,573
Until I saw you with
someone who's not me

52
00:04:59,997 --> 00:05:03,236
You've got me playing in
a game that ain't fair

53
00:05:03,716 --> 00:05:07,922
But you're taking me there,
but you're taking me there

54
00:05:08,173 --> 00:05:12,134
Oh, I can't help myself, it's
human nature, human nature

55
00:05:12,522 --> 00:05:14,699
Who's to say what's
meant to be?

56
00:05:15,789 --> 00:05:20,578
Oh, why can't we be on our worst
behavior, worst behavior

57
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:22,447
When it comes so naturally

58
00:05:23,673 --> 00:05:28,220
'Cause I would like, to get what?
(to know you baby)

59
00:05:28,368 --> 00:05:31,441
Like to get, under
your sexy body

(Under your sexy body)

64
00:05:47,323 --> 00:05:50,468
I know what you're doing
when you hold her like that

65
00:05:51,046 --> 00:05:54,418
You're looking at me to see
if I'm looking back

66
00:05:54,949 --> 00:05:58,805
But me and you both know
where tonight is gon' lead

67
00:05:58,966 --> 00:06:00,531
'Cause you're leaving with me

68
00:06:00,891 --> 00:06:02,942
But you're leaving with
me, yeah

69
00:06:03,264 --> 00:06:07,560
Oh, I can't help myself, it's
human nature, human nature

70
00:06:07,735 --> 00:06:09,694
Who's to say what's meant to be?

71
00:06:10,858 --> 00:06:15,140
Oh, why can't we be on our worst
behavior, worst behavior

72
00:06:15,513 --> 00:06:17,383

Thank you so much!

101
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:14,491
Amsterdam, how are we
feeling tonight?

102
00:08:16,586 --> 00:08:17,911
What about you guys up there?

103
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:19,438
Are you feeling alright?

104
00:08:22,594 --> 00:08:24,852
I am so happy to be here.

105
00:08:25,277 --> 00:08:28,782
Welcome to the Venus tour
with me and my girls.

106
00:08:30,684 --> 00:08:32,532
We're gonna have a
good night tonight.

107
00:08:34,974 --> 00:08:39,833
Let's all just escape for
a second to planet Venus.

108
00:08:42,709 --> 00:08:44,565
(Na, na, na,
yeah)

109
00:08:45,677 --> 00:08:49,301
Let's put on our dancing shoes
and get a little hot and sweaty.

110
00:08:51,694 --> 00:08:55,771
Everything's going like crazy
Yeah

111
00:08:56,039 --> 00:09:00,242
Don't even got time
to breathe, oh yeah

112
00:09:00,495 --> 00:09:04,572
Lately I'm needing my baby, mm-mm

113
00:09:04,893 --> 00:09:08,024
To come and take care of
me, me, me, me

114
00:09:08,187 --> 00:09:09,440
(Please) Could you pour
up my drink?

115
00:09:09,619 --> 00:09:10,537
Could you rub my feet?

116
00:09:10,709 --> 00:09:11,674
Would you roll with me?

117
00:09:11,846 --> 00:09:13,440
Hey, baby, I'm (Weak)

118
00:09:14,149 --> 00:09:16,358
In the knees, yeah

119
00:09:16,521 --> 00:09:18,155
(Please) Could you pour
up my drink?

120
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:19,255
'Cause you know my kink

121
00:09:19,437 --> 00:09:20,368
Would you roll with me?

122
00:09:20,544 --> 00:09:22,127
Hey, baby, I'm weak

123
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:25,099
Come fly with me, yeah

124
00:09:25,366 --> 00:09:28,236
Ooh, you got my heart goin', bae

125
00:09:28,446 --> 00:09:30,355
I think we one and the same

126
00:09:30,552 --> 00:09:33,209
Baby, be my escape

127
00:09:34,191 --> 00:09:36,977
Maybe we could hop on a plane

128
00:09:37,171 --> 00:09:39,025
Hear you calling my name

129
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:41,659
Baby, be my escape

130
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:45,830

Would you be my, be

133
00:09:52,065 --> 00:09:53,623
See, it's a private flight

134
00:09:53,812 --> 00:09:55,861
You can take me all the
way, anywhere you like

135
00:09:56,023 --> 00:10:00,305
Just don't let me go

136
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:02,408
Leave all the finer things

137
00:10:02,582 --> 00:10:04,692
When I'm lying next to
you, that's enough for me

138
00:10:04,804 --> 00:10:08,670
Just don't let me go

139
00:10:10,823 --> 00:10:16,704
Ooh, hey
Yeah

140
00:10:17,391 --> 00:10:20,451
So maybe we could hop on a plane

141
00:10:20,716 --> 00:10:22,617
Hear you calling my name

142
00:10:22,819 --> 00:10:25,561
Baby, be my escape

143
00:10:25,837 --> 00:10:29,504
Got me feeling like ooh,

00:10:29,676 --> 00:10:32,085

Na na na, whoa-oh

148
00:10:41,646 --> 00:10:46,072
Would you be my, be

149
00:10:46,224 --> 00:10:49,365
Yeah

150
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:52,303
Alright, Amsterdam

151
00:10:52,668 --> 00:10:55,962
Let's throw it back
to Poster Girl.

152
00:10:58,062 --> 00:10:59,865
Now this is Look What
You've Done.

153
00:11:07,618 --> 00:11:11,636
And now they're playing
our favorite song that

154
00:11:11,897 --> 00:11:15,527
We used to dance to,
nights like tonight

155
00:11:15,702 --> 00:11:19,839
The pain is fading,
feels so amazing

156
00:11:20,067 --> 00:11:23,699
To know you hurt me
for the last time

157
00:11:23,859 --> 00:11:25,805
So I ain't crying anymore

158
00:11:27,434 --> 00:11:30,674
I'm stronger than I was before

159
00:11:31,818 --> 00:11:34,898
You keep calling me again

160
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:38,374
But I keep dancing anyway

161
00:11:39,877 --> 00:11:41,714
'Cause now that you're gone

162
00:11:42,358 --> 00:11:44,117
I'm number one

163
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:48,020
Boy, I should thank
you for who I've become

164
00:11:48,453 --> 00:11:50,004
Don't need no one

165
00:11:50,308 --> 00:11:51,884
This girl's having fun

166
00:11:52,184 --> 00:11:54,098
Watch me catch fire

167
00:11:54,303 --> 00:11:56,087
Yeah, look what you've done

168
00:11:56,533 --> 00:11:58,405
Look what you've done

169
00:11:58,608 --> 00:11:59,729
(Look what you've done)

170
00:12:00,273 --> 00:12:01,210
(Look what you've done)

171
00:12:01,659 --> 00:12:04,156
Look what you've done

172
00:12:04,632 --> 00:12:08,303
Look what you've done

173
00:12:08,637 --> 00:12:09,443
(Look what you've done)

174
00:12:09,793 --> 00:12:11,200
Look what you've done

175
00:12:11,525 --> 00:12:12,990
(Look what you've done)

176
00:12:14,054 --> 00:12:18,173
Baby, can't you see what
you've done to me?

177
00:12:18,433 --> 00:12:19,962
Look what I've become

178
00:12:20,452 --> 00:12:22,755
Look what you have done

179
00:12:24,485 --> 00:12:27,212
Look what you have done

180
00:12:28,852 --> 00:12:30,846
'Cause now that you're gone

181
00:12:31,127 --> 00:12:32,932
I'm number one

182
00:12:33,261 --> 00:12:36,363
Boy, I should thank you for
who I've become

183
00:12:36,556 --> 00:12:38,771
Who I've become
(Don't need no one)

184
00:12:39,082 --> 00:12:40,442
This girl's having fun

185
00:12:40,619 --> 00:12:43,821
This girl is having
so much fun.

186
00:12:45,195 --> 00:12:46,982
Now, look what you've done

187
00:12:47,237 --> 00:12:48,307
(Look what you've done)

188
00:12:48,845 --> 00:12:50,048
(Look what you've done)

189
00:12:50,315 --> 00:12:53,270
Look what, look what
you've done

190
00:12:53,546 --> 00:12:57,921
Look what you've done,
hey yeah

191
00:12:58,566 --> 00:13:02,592
Baby, now look what
you've done.

192
00:13:11,167 --> 00:13:12,790
Where's all my girls?

193
00:13:17,417 --> 00:13:18,032
Hey!

194
00:13:25,257 --> 00:13:25,927
(What do girls like?)

195
00:13:26,088 --> 00:13:27,725
I know what boys like

196
00:13:28,129 --> 00:13:29,838
I know what they want

197
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:31,797
They want that good thing

198
00:13:32,012 --> 00:13:33,773
They wanna get some

199
00:13:34,011 --> 00:13:35,652
I know what boys like

200
00:13:35,931 --> 00:13:37,476
I know what they want

201
00:13:37,757 --> 00:13:39,993
So go ahead and prove me right

202
00:13:40,315 --> 00:13:41,541
Cause that's what girls like

203
00:13:41,723 --> 00:13:42,908
Don't need me a guy who's a friend

204
00:13:43,188 --> 00:13:44,879
He better pick me up in a Benz

205
00:13:45,057 --> 00:13:46,812
I like cruisin' around the West End

206
00:13:47,035 --> 00:13:49,506
No Netflix and chill, that's dead
(All the girls like)

207
00:13:50,795 --> 00:13:52,722
I don't need your money for my rent
(All the girls like)

208
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:54,874
I'm not an eight or a nine, I'm a ten
(All the girls like)

209
00:13:55,012 --> 00:13:57,125
What's the code to your Wi-Fi again?
(G-G-Girls like)

210
00:13:57,268 --> 00:13:58,675
I know what boys like

211
00:13:59,022 --> 00:14:00,766
I know what they want

212
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:02,782
They want that good thing

213
00:14:03,004 --> 00:14:04,726
They wanna get some

214
00:14:04,916 --> 00:14:06,597
I know what boys like

215
00:14:06,791 --> 00:14:08,451
I know what they want

216
00:14:08,726 --> 00:14:10,863
So go ahead and prove me right

217
00:14:11,121 --> 00:14:12,921
Cause that's what girls like

218
00:14:19,696 --> 00:14:20,514
(Go)

219
00:14:27,691 --> 00:14:29,403
At your house again

220
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:31,101
Are we more than friends?

221
00:14:31,456 --> 00:14:33,826
There's so much that I wanna say

222
00:14:34,715 --> 00:14:36,908
But I gotta hold it back

223
00:14:37,243 --> 00:14:38,937
So scared how you'll react

224
00:14:39,286 --> 00:14:41,683
I just hide it all away

225
00:14:41,952 --> 00:14:44,643
I could give you it
all in a minute

226
00:14:44,855 --> 00:14:46,557
We'll fall any minute

227
00:14:46,726 --> 00:14:49,435
But we go 'round and 'round

228
00:14:49,629 --> 00:14:52,456
I don't wanna mention commitment

229
00:14:52,588 --> 00:14:54,365
But I feel it slippin'

230
00:14:54,555 --> 00:14:59,293
So please don't let
me down, me down

231
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:02,427
I got the words "I love you"

232
00:15:02,671 --> 00:15:05,140
Sittin' on the tip of my tongue

233
00:15:05,957 --> 00:15:07,729
Oh, I feel like

234
00:15:07,917 --> 00:15:10,345
As soon as they leave my mouth

235
00:15:10,529 --> 00:15:12,933
You're just gonna get up and run

236
00:15:13,502 --> 00:15:15,291
You're gonna run away

237
00:15:16,122 --> 00:15:17,725
You know we connect

238
00:15:18,028 --> 00:15:19,796
More than just the sex

239
00:15:20,013 --> 00:15:22,456
But are you gonna let me in?

240
00:15:23,016 --> 00:15:25,520
Yeah, I can set your world on fire

241
00:15:25,762 --> 00:15:27,454
But you're holdin' the lighter

242
00:15:27,729 --> 00:15:29,968
Instead, you're puttin'
out our flame

243
00:15:30,319 --> 00:15:33,164
I could give you it
all in a minute

244
00:15:33,312 --> 00:15:35,059
We'll fall any minute

245
00:15:35,209 --> 00:15:37,825
But we go 'round and 'round

246
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:40,756
I don't wanna mention commitment

247
00:15:40,935 --> 00:15:42,845
But I feel it slippin'

248
00:15:43,002 --> 00:15:45,837
So please don't let
me down

249
00:15:46,494 --> 00:15:48,973
I got the words "I love you"

250
00:15:49,151 --> 00:15:51,631
Sittin' on the tip of my tongue

251
00:15:52,361 --> 00:15:54,188
Oh, I feel like

252
00:15:54,416 --> 00:15:56,687
As soon as they leave my mouth

253
00:15:56,909 --> 00:15:59,294
You're just gonna get up and run

254
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:02,187
You're gonna run away
(Run)

255
00:16:02,394 --> 00:16:04,142
Run away (Run)

256
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:06,040
Run away (Run)

257
00:16:06,197 --> 00:16:08,267
I got the words "I love you"

258
00:16:08,493 --> 00:16:10,828
Sittin' on the tip of my tongue

259
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,382
Oh, I feel like

260
00:16:13,584 --> 00:16:16,133
As soon as they leave my mouth

261
00:16:16,298 --> 00:16:18,597
You're just gonna get up and run

262
00:16:18,983 --> 00:16:21,345
You're gonna run away

263
00:16:21,685 --> 00:16:23,469
If I say it now

264
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:27,037
Then one day, I'll wake up
and you walked out

265
00:16:27,191 --> 00:16:28,414
You walked out,
you walked out

266
00:16:28,545 --> 00:16:31,564
(So I just stay here with
The words "I love you")

267
00:16:31,696 --> 00:16:33,764
Sittin' on the tip of my tongue

268
00:16:38,526 --> 00:16:39,331
(I love you)

269
00:16:40,236 --> 00:16:41,395
(I love you)

270
00:16:42,223 --> 00:16:43,367
(I love you)

271
00:16:45,308 --> 00:16:51,113
Run, run, run
(I love you)

272
00:16:58,477 --> 00:16:59,932
Thank you.

273
00:17:04,631 --> 00:17:08,752
I used to be so happy, but without
you here I feel so low

274
00:17:11,227 --> 00:17:15,004
I watched you as you left, but
I can never seem to let you go

275
00:17:16,813 --> 00:17:20,107
'Cause once upon a time
you were my everything

276
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:23,145
It's clear to see that time
hasn't changed a thing

277
00:17:23,388 --> 00:17:24,382
No

278
00:17:24,576 --> 00:17:28,215
It's buried deep inside me, but I feel
there's somethin' you should know

279
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:30,448
Hey

280
00:17:30,728 --> 00:17:33,227
I will never
forget you, yeah

281
00:17:33,938 --> 00:17:36,783
You will always be by my side

282
00:17:37,172 --> 00:17:39,438
From the day that I met you

283
00:17:39,908 --> 00:17:43,083
I knew that I would love
you 'til the day I die

284
00:17:43,386 --> 00:17:46,415
And I will never want much more

285
00:17:46,611 --> 00:17:50,538
And in my heart,
I will always be sure

286
00:17:50,758 --> 00:17:52,214
I will never forget you

287
00:17:53,169 --> 00:17:57,589
And you will always be
by my side 'til the day I die

288
00:18:02,615 --> 00:18:03,987
'Til the day I die

289
00:18:10,427 --> 00:18:14,772
Funny how we both end up here,
but everything seems so right

290
00:18:15,833 --> 00:18:16,878
Right

291
00:18:17,079 --> 00:18:20,951
I wonder what would happen
if we went back and put up a fight

292
00:18:22,714 --> 00:18:25,928
'Cause once upon a time
you were my everything

293
00:18:26,106 --> 00:18:29,288
It's clear to see that
time hasn't changed a thing

294
00:18:29,531 --> 00:18:33,752
So, what in this world do you think
could ever take you off my mind?

295
00:18:33,892 --> 00:18:35,961
(Take you off my mind)

296
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:38,522
I will never forget you, yeah

297
00:18:39,739 --> 00:18:42,405
You will always be by my side

298
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:45,295
From the day that I met you

299
00:18:45,683 --> 00:18:48,814
I knew that I would love
you 'til the day I die

300
00:18:49,018 --> 00:18:52,145
And I will never want much more

301

And in my heart,
I will always be sure

302
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:58,148
I will never forget you

303
00:18:59,319 --> 00:19:02,720
And you will always be
by my side 'til the day I die

304
00:19:02,868 --> 00:19:06,079
Because I'm feelin' it, lovin' it,
everything that we do

305
00:19:06,323 --> 00:19:09,468
And all along, I knew I had
somethin' special with you

306
00:19:09,626 --> 00:19:12,587
But sometimes you just gotta know
that these things fall through

307
00:19:12,745 --> 00:19:15,738
But I'm still tied and I can't hide
my connection with you

308
00:19:15,889 --> 00:19:19,365
'Cause I am feelin' it, lovin' it,
everything that we do

309
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:22,547
And all along, I knew I had
something special with you

310
00:19:22,724 --> 00:19:25,767
But sometimes you just gotta
know that these things fall through

311
00:19:25,936 --> 00:19:28,772
I can't hide my connection with you

312
00:19:29,033 --> 00:19:31,409
(I will never forget you, yeah)

313
00:19:32,257 --> 00:19:35,107
(You will always be by my side)

314
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:37,938
(From the day that I met you)

315
00:19:38,341 --> 00:19:41,452
(I knew that I would love
you 'til the day I die)

316
00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:44,842
And I will never want much more

317
00:19:45,044 --> 00:19:48,864
And in my heart,

Never, never, never, never

325
00:20:15,048 --> 00:20:17,275
I will never forget you

326
00:20:18,252 --> 00:20:20,697
And you will always be by my side

327

00:20:49,438 --> 00:20:51,381
Are you having a
good time so far?

331
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:55,442
What about you
guys on the sides?

332
00:20:56,288 --> 00:20:57,762
I didn't check with you guys yet.

333
00:20:57,932 --> 00:20:58,906
Are you having a good time?

334
00:21:00,826 --> 00:21:04,317
I am so so happy to be

335
00:21:04,942 --> 00:21:07,616
I love these signs.
Are you the number one zluts?

336
00:21:08,336 --> 00:21:09,082

337
00:21:09,575 --> 00:21:11,195
I got you, I got you.

338
00:21:11,479 --> 00:21:12,873
Could you give that vinyl, please?

339
00:21:14,002 --> 00:21:16,595
Could you?
Thank you.

340
00:21:17,304 --> 00:21:19,595
This is my new album, Venus.

341
00:21:19,907 --> 00:21:23,936
Has anyone heard it yet?
Yeah?

342
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:26,606
What's your favorite song on it?

343
00:21:28,171 --> 00:21:29,353
Ammunition?

344
00:21:29,763 --> 00:21:33,563
Well, today is your luck day
'cause I'm gonna play that song.

345
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:37,178
I, I'm really really happy,

00:21:37,356 --> 00:21:40,250
I really am that you all

347
00:21:40,403 --> 00:21:44,601
I mean, this is my favorite
spot on the whole entire earth.

348
00:21:44,839 --> 00:21:47,180
And to just be here with
this many people.

349
00:21:47,538 --> 00:21:49,292
And make beautiful memories

350
00:21:49,463 --> 00:21:51,091
and just create together.

351
00:21:51,985 --> 00:21:52,890
Honestly,

352
00:21:53,386 --> 00:21:56,514
this is probably the best
nights of the tour so far.

353
00:21:56,910 --> 00:21:58,586
Could you give this back?

354
00:22:01,145 --> 00:22:03,123
So I will forgive you, guys

355
00:22:03,603 --> 00:22:07,524
If don't know all the words

356
00:22:07,718 --> 00:22:09,708
'Cause it didn't come
out that long ago.

357
00:22:10,232 --> 00:22:11,988
I barely know them myself.

358
00:22:12,312 --> 00:22:15,417
The one who knows know,
I struggle sometimes with lyrics,

359
00:22:15,699 --> 00:22:19,462
but I think you guys know
this next song.

360
00:22:19,724 --> 00:22:22,035
And if you do, please don't be shy.

361
00:22:22,202 --> 00:22:23,881
If you wanna stand up,

Now I'm sleeping alone and
I'm starting to freeze

370

Baby, come bring me hell

Alright, let's slow it
down for a second.

443
00:26:12,464 --> 00:26:15,848
The one before you wasn't careful

444
00:26:16,407 --> 00:26:21,953
The one before you took
my heart around the core

445
00:26:23,055 --> 00:26:26,049
The one before you wasn't gentle

446
00:26:26,579 --> 00:26:32,317
Nobody told me love
was a contact sport

447
00:26:32,895 --> 00:26:37,521
So no, he's not your fault

448
00:26:38,021 --> 00:26:42,000
That I can't love you yet

449
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:45,162
But can I be with you

450
00:26:45,613 --> 00:26:47,827
after the healing

451
00:26:48,266 --> 00:26:52,675
After the healing is done?

452
00:26:53,334 --> 00:26:58,296
So can I be with you
after the hurting

453
00:26:58,696 --> 00:27:03,026
After the monsters in my
head are finally gone?

454
00:27:03,633 --> 00:27:10,563
So can I be with you
after the healing?

455
00:27:14,584 --> 00:27:17,452
The one before you wasn't easy

456
00:27:18,214 --> 00:27:23,652
The one before you pushed
me right over the edge

457
00:27:24,935 --> 00:27:27,739
And now I got some
trouble sleeping

458
00:27:28,691 --> 00:27:33,573
I'm kept awake by
knife left in my bed

459
00:27:34,964 --> 00:27:38,639
So no, he's not your fault

460
00:27:40,234 --> 00:27:44,353
That I can't love you yet

461
00:27:44,813 --> 00:27:47,260
But can I be with you

462
00:27:47,579 --> 00:27:49,838

463
00:27:50,165 --> 00:27:54,451

So can I be with you
after the healing?

467
00:28:16,192 --> 00:28:18,844
So give me just a little time

468
00:28:19,035 --> 00:28:21,512
'Cause I just gotta let me cry

469
00:28:21,767 --> 00:28:25,430
This isn't your responsibility

470
00:28:26,109 --> 00:28:30,806
'Cause I wanna be with
you after the healing

471
00:28:31,351 --> 00:28:35,678

472
00:28:36,355 --> 00:28:41,431
So can I be with you
after the hurting

473
00:28:41,748 --> 00:28:46,233

00:28:47,124 --> 00:28:49,766
So give me just a little time

475
00:28:49,929 --> 00:28:52,617
'Cause I just gotta let me cry

476
00:28:52,788 --> 00:28:57,181
This isn't your responsibility

477
00:28:57,466 --> 00:29:02,157
Can I be with you

So can I be with you
after the healing?

480
00:29:36,469 --> 00:29:40,358
The beginning is a very
delicate time.

481
00:31:30,438 --> 00:31:31,598
Amsterdam!

482
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:36,535
Do you wanna be part of
my symphony tonight?

483
00:31:38,876 --> 00:31:40,216
You ready?

484
00:31:41,435 --> 00:31:44,365
I've been hearin' symphonies

485
00:31:45,483 --> 00:31:49,572
Before, all I heard was silence
Hey!

486
00:31:49,756 --> 00:31:52,621
A rhapsody for you and me

487
00:31:53,273 --> 00:31:57,714
And every melody is timeless

488
00:31:58,091 --> 00:32:01,324
Life was stringin' me along

489
00:32:02,214 --> 00:32:05,840
Then you came and
you cut me loose

490
00:32:06,435 --> 00:32:09,548
Was solo, singin' on my own

491
00:32:10,558 --> 00:32:13,382
Now I can't find the key without you

492
00:32:13,643 --> 00:32:17,317
And now your song is on repeat

493
00:32:17,545 --> 00:32:21,619
And I'm dancin' on
to your heartbeat

494
00:32:21,853 --> 00:32:25,061
And when you're gone,
I feel incomplete

495
00:32:25,199 --> 00:32:27,161
Are you ready?
(So, if you want the truth)

496
00:32:27,703 --> 00:32:32,387
Woah-oh, I just wanna be
part of your symphony

497
00:32:34,698 --> 00:32:38,247

Symphony

499
00:32:42,712 --> 00:32:46,420

00:32:46,694 --> 00:32:50,135
Will you hold me tight
and not let go?

501
00:32:50,734 --> 00:32:53,251
I'm sorry if it's all too much

502
00:32:54,663 --> 00:32:57,956
Every day you're here, I'm healin'

503
00:32:58,435 --> 00:33:00,898
And I was runnin' outta luck

504
00:33:02,256 --> 00:33:05,441

505
00:33:06,347 --> 00:33:09,570

on the radio, hey

530
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:46,647
Symphony

531
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:50,848
(Will you hold me
tight and not let go?)

532
00:34:51,859 --> 00:34:55,126
Symphony

533
00:34:55,484 --> 00:34:59,191
Like a love song
on the radio

534
00:34:59,384 --> 00:35:03,402
Will you hold me
tight and not let go?

535
00:35:06,127 --> 00:35:07,528
Thank you!

536
00:35:08,838 --> 00:35:10,280
That was amazing.

537
00:35:13,104 --> 00:35:18,811
Alright, let's throw it back, like
really throw it back

538
00:35:19,258 --> 00:35:25,748
to the very beginning
of my career, and

539
00:35:27,116 --> 00:35:31,863
this song is so special to me,
and especially here 'cause it was

540
00:35:31,998 --> 00:35:34,601
so well-recieved and
I feel like you guys

541
00:35:34,743 --> 00:35:37,653
have been a part of my
journey for over a decade

542
00:35:38,941 --> 00:35:41,348
and I just wanna sing this song
with you guys tonight

543
00:35:41,889 --> 00:35:46,284
still one of my favorite songs,
you know what to do

544
00:35:46,611 --> 00:35:50,057
if you know the words,
come on, Amsterdam,

545
00:35:54,304 --> 00:35:56,135
are you with me?

546
00:36:00,509 --> 00:36:05,672
Nobody sees, nobody knows

547
00:36:06,416 --> 00:36:11,249
We are a secret, can't be exposed

548
00:36:11,638 --> 00:36:16,596
That's how it is,
that's how it goes

549
00:36:17,088 --> 00:36:19,351
Far from the others

550
00:36:19,824 --> 00:36:22,386
Close to each other

551
00:36:23,389 --> 00:36:25,937
In the daylight,
in the daylight

552
00:36:26,154 --> 00:36:28,537
When the sun is shinin'

553
00:36:28,757 --> 00:36:31,358
On a late night,
on a late night

554
00:36:31,543 --> 00:36:33,704
When the moon is blindin'

555
00:36:33,992 --> 00:36:36,650
In plain sight,
plain sight

556
00:36:36,882 --> 00:36:39,237
Like stars in hidin'

557
00:36:39,456 --> 00:36:44,076
You and I burn on, on

558
00:36:44,241 --> 00:36:47,595
Put two and together, forever

559
00:36:47,804 --> 00:36:49,592
We'll never change

560
00:36:49,767 --> 00:36:51,742
Two and together

561
00:36:51,934 --> 00:36:53,924
We'll never change

562
00:36:54,463 --> 00:36:59,337
Nobody sees, nobody knows

563
00:36:59,642 --> 00:37:04,157
We are a secret,
can't be exposed

564
00:37:05,092 --> 00:37:09,999
That's how it is,
that's how it goes

565
00:37:10,585 --> 00:37:12,861
Far from the others

566
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:15,520
Close to each other

567
00:37:15,897 --> 00:37:20,804
That's when we uncover-cover-cover

568
00:37:21,059 --> 00:37:26,446
That's when we uncover-cover-cover

569
00:37:27,113 --> 00:37:30,004
My asylum, my asylum

570
00:37:30,218 --> 00:37:32,535
Is in your arms

571
00:37:32,736 --> 00:37:35,364
When the world gives
heavy burdens

572
00:37:35,521 --> 00:37:38,079
I can bear a thousand tons

573
00:37:38,241 --> 00:37:40,896
On your shoulder,
on your shoulder

574
00:37:41,066 --> 00:37:43,439
I can reach an endless sky

575
00:37:43,743 --> 00:37:47,989
Feels like paradise

576
00:37:48,275 --> 00:37:51,650
Put two and together, forever

577
00:37:51,825 --> 00:37:53,631
We'll never change

578
00:37:53,819 --> 00:37:55,805
Two and together

579
00:37:55,976 --> 00:37:58,685
We'll never change.
Sing!

580
00:37:58,837 --> 00:38:03,306
Nobody sees, nobody knows

581
00:38:03,684 --> 00:38:08,697
We are a secret, can't be exposed

582
00:38:08,986 --> 00:38:14,122
And that's how it is,
that's how it goes

583
00:38:14,538 --> 00:38:16,815
Far from the others

584
00:38:17,132 --> 00:38:19,454
Close to each other

585
00:38:19,885 --> 00:38:24,714
That's when we uncover-cover-cover

586
00:38:25,006 --> 00:38:30,676
That's when we uncover-cover-cover

587
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:34,891
But we could build a
universe right here

588
00:38:35,310 --> 00:38:37,636
All the world could disappear

589
00:38:37,903 --> 00:38:41,297
I wouldn't notice, I wouldn't care

590
00:38:41,584 --> 00:38:45,782
'Cause we could build
a universe right here

591
00:38:45,944 --> 00:38:48,780
The world could disappear

592
00:38:49,113 --> 00:38:54,728
I just need you near.
Sing!

593
00:38:54,860 --> 00:39:00,110
Nobody sees, nobody knows

594
00:39:00,424 --> 00:39:03,546
We are a secret, can't be exposed

595
00:39:05,094 --> 00:39:09,860
That's how it is, that's how it goes

596
00:39:10,154 --> 00:39:13,021
Far from the others

597
00:39:13,177 --> 00:39:15,524
Close to each other

598
00:39:15,710 --> 00:39:20,556
But that's when we
uncover-cover-cover

599
00:39:21,003 --> 00:39:26,389
That's when we uncover-cover-cover

600
00:39:26,558 --> 00:39:30,183
That's when we uncover.

601
00:39:31,692 --> 00:39:33,358
Thank you so much.

602
00:39:35,011 --> 00:39:36,605
That was beautiful.

603
00:39:36,744 --> 00:39:38,075
Thank you, Amsterdam.

604
00:40:15,376 --> 00:40:16,804
Make your jaw drop-drop

605
00:40:16,949 --> 00:40:18,797
Say, "Oh my," drop-drop-drop

606
00:40:18,952 --> 00:40:20,422
Make you say, "Oh my god"

607
00:40:20,594 --> 00:40:21,513
My, drop-drop

608
00:40:21,679 --> 00:40:22,624
Make your jaw drop

609
00:40:22,812 --> 00:40:24,089
Make you say, "Oh my god"

610
00:40:24,317 --> 00:40:26,749
And you never felt
this type of emotion

611
00:40:27,735 --> 00:40:29,126
Make your jaw drop-drop

612
00:40:29,352 --> 00:40:31,168
Say, "Oh my," drop-drop-drop

613
00:40:31,366 --> 00:40:32,712
Make you say, "Oh my god"

614
00:40:32,911 --> 00:40:33,825
My, drop-drop

615
00:40:33,984 --> 00:40:35,010
Make your jaw drop

616
00:40:35,198 --> 00:40:36,544
Make you say, "Oh my god"

617
00:40:36,702 --> 00:40:39,160
And you never felt
this type of emotion

618
00:40:40,162 --> 00:40:42,599
Baby, I'm not even in a gown

619
00:40:43,057 --> 00:40:45,712
I'm just in a T-shirt on the couch

620
00:40:46,102 --> 00:40:48,770
The way you want me
makes me want you now

621
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:52,969
The only thing you
have to say is (Wow)

622
00:40:53,232 --> 00:40:56,133
And I feel this
way with no chemicals

623
00:40:56,372 --> 00:40:59,058
In my system, babe, it's incredible

624
00:40:59,314 --> 00:41:00,717
When you're touching me,

625
00:41:00,908 --> 00:41:02,263
yeah, that says it all

626
00:41:02,446 --> 00:41:04,733
You said it all (Yeah)

627
00:41:04,968 --> 00:41:06,769
(Baby, I'm not even in a gown)

628
00:41:06,902 --> 00:41:08,152
I'm not even in a gown

629
00:41:08,270 --> 00:41:09,869
(I'm just in a T-shirt on the couch)

630
00:41:10,973 --> 00:41:12,877
The way you want me
makes me want you now

631
00:41:13,041 --> 00:41:14,046
Want me now

632
00:41:14,198 --> 00:41:17,325
The only thing you
have to say is (Wow)

633
00:41:17,465 --> 00:41:18,775
Make your jaw drop-drop

634
00:41:18,930 --> 00:41:20,767
Say, "Oh my," drop-drop-drop

635
00:41:20,916 --> 00:41:22,347
Make you say, "Oh my god"

636
00:41:22,477 --> 00:41:23,396
My, drop-drop

637
00:41:23,553 --> 00:41:24,489
Make your jaw drop

638
00:41:24,656 --> 00:41:26,127
Make you say, "Oh my god"

639
00:41:26,290 --> 00:41:28,865
And you never felt
this type of emotion

640
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:31,212
Make your jaw drop-drop

641
00:41:31,384 --> 00:41:33,181
Say, "Oh my," drop-drop-drop

642
00:41:33,321 --> 00:41:34,727
Make you say, "Oh my god"

643
00:41:34,886 --> 00:41:35,872
My, drop-drop

644
00:41:36,042 --> 00:41:37,022
Make your jaw drop

645
00:41:37,174 --> 00:41:38,621
Make you say, "Oh my god"

646
00:41:38,752 --> 00:41:41,364
(And you never felt this type of emotion)
Never, never, never

647
00:41:41,981 --> 00:41:44,996
Never, never, never, oh

648
00:41:45,235 --> 00:41:48,258
Never, never, never, oh

649
00:41:48,432 --> 00:41:51,274
Never, never, never, oh

650
00:41:51,481 --> 00:41:53,143
Never, eh

651
00:41:54,657 --> 00:41:56,610
Make your jaw
make your jaw drop

652
00:41:57,980 --> 00:41:59,856
Make you say, "Oh my god"

653
00:42:00,517 --> 00:42:02,650
Make your jaw
make your jaw drop

654
00:42:03,493 --> 00:42:06,232
And you never felt
this type of emotion.

655
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:16,605
(None of these guys;
Nothing on mine)

656
00:42:16,806 --> 00:42:18,723
(None of these, none of these,
none of these, none of these)

657
00:42:18,958 --> 00:42:20,904
None of these guys
got nothing on mine

658
00:42:21,068 --> 00:42:22,998
They're either too short,
they're either too high

659
00:42:23,232 --> 00:42:25,420
None of these guys
got nothing on mine

660
00:42:25,593 --> 00:42:26,655
(Nothing on mine)

661
00:42:27,716 --> 00:42:29,661
None of these guys
got nothing on mine

662
00:42:29,890 --> 00:42:31,885
They don't have his cool,
they don't have his style

663
00:42:32,119 --> 00:42:34,174
Yeah, none of these
guys got nothing on mine

664
00:42:34,509 --> 00:42:35,446
(Nothing on mine)

665
00:42:37,149 --> 00:42:39,039
Feelin' sweaty and crowded

666
00:42:39,565 --> 00:42:41,296
Drippin' down to my knees

667
00:42:41,754 --> 00:42:43,727
They woke up but I doubt they

668
00:42:43,978 --> 00:42:45,383
Got the right energy

669
00:42:46,323 --> 00:42:48,424
Hundred bodies touchin' all around

670
00:42:48,639 --> 00:42:50,523
But I'm only lookin' at one

671
00:42:50,730 --> 00:42:52,529
All these guys look alive but

672
00:42:52,696 --> 00:42:54,276
They're just NPCs

673
00:42:54,450 --> 00:42:56,236
None of these guys
got nothing on mine

674
00:42:56,432 --> 00:42:58,483
They're either too short,
they're either too high

675
00:42:58,765 --> 00:43:00,847
Yeah, none of these guys
got nothing on mine

676
00:43:01,103 --> 00:43:03,321
(Nothing on mine, they got
nothing, they got nothing)

677
00:43:03,471 --> 00:43:05,193
None of these guys
got nothing on mine

678
00:43:05,438 --> 00:43:07,549
They don't have his cool,
they don't have his style

679
00:43:07,767 --> 00:43:09,783
Yeah, none of these
guys got nothing on mine

680
00:43:09,941 --> 00:43:11,100
(Nothing on mine)

681
00:43:11,337 --> 00:43:14,039
Through the night

682
00:43:14,224 --> 00:43:18,412
Nobody can read the signs

683
00:43:18,658 --> 00:43:22,777
You stand out from all these guys

684
00:43:23,083 --> 00:43:26,083
Way you make me feel so right

685
00:43:27,317 --> 00:43:31,812
Babe, they might hate
but I can't lie-ie

686
00:43:32,213 --> 00:43:34,070
None of these guys
got nothing on mine

687
00:43:34,322 --> 00:43:36,307
They're either too short,
they're either too high

688
00:43:36,519 --> 00:43:38,737
Yeah, none of these
guys got nothing on mine

689
00:43:38,923 --> 00:43:40,942
(None of these guys
got nothing on mine)

690
00:43:41,122 --> 00:43:43,098
None of these guys
got nothing on mine

691
00:43:43,266 --> 00:43:45,298
They don't have his cool,
they don't have his style

692
00:43:45,458 --> 00:43:47,482
Yeah, none of these
guys got nothing on mine

693
00:43:47,645 --> 00:43:49,017
(mine, mine, mine)

694
00:43:49,159 --> 00:43:51,775
Through the night

695
00:43:51,990 --> 00:43:56,316
Nobody can read the signs

696
00:43:56,533 --> 00:44:00,566
You stand out from all these guys

697
00:44:00,886 --> 00:44:03,831
Way you make me feel so right

698
00:44:05,296 --> 00:44:08,425
They might hate but I can't lie.

699
00:44:13,394 --> 00:44:17,807
Alright, this next one.
This one's for my friend over there

700
00:44:18,245 --> 00:44:22,549
and which also happens to be
one of my personal favorites off Venus.

701
00:44:25,078 --> 00:44:27,674
You know my situation

702
00:44:28,341 --> 00:44:31,444
Why you acting like
you can't be patient?

703
00:44:32,331 --> 00:44:35,860
All I'm hearing from you lately.
What?

704
00:44:36,066 --> 00:44:39,750
"Monogamy's so fucking dated"
Huh?

705
00:44:39,972 --> 00:44:43,162
(Mm-mm) Boys like you
love fantasy

706
00:44:43,718 --> 00:44:47,102
(Mm-mm) Anime, no,
that ain't me

707
00:44:47,531 --> 00:44:50,841
(Mm-mm) They dream 'bout
controlling things

708
00:44:51,264 --> 00:44:55,176
(Mm-mm) Sad you went so
cold on me, come hold on me

709
00:44:55,486 --> 00:44:57,174
You've been distant

710
00:44:57,824 --> 00:44:59,742
I wanna give us a shot, please

711
00:44:59,935 --> 00:45:02,735
Give me, give me,
give me ammunition

712
00:45:03,258 --> 00:45:05,163
Love me, love me,
kiss me, touch me

713
00:45:05,328 --> 00:45:07,017
I wanna give us a shot, please

714
00:45:07,218 --> 00:45:09,733
Give me, give me,
give me ammunition

715
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:12,674
You know my intuition
(Intuition, yoh)

716
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:16,239
Got me out here looking
at you different (Different)

717
00:45:16,430 --> 00:45:19,995
You've been acting like
you on a mission (Yoh)

718
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:24,740
Tryna make this love we made
go missing, mm-mm yeah

719
00:45:25,608 --> 00:45:29,246
Girls like me know what
we need (Mm-mm)

720
00:45:29,391 --> 00:45:31,379
Fix yourself or watch
me leave (Mm-mm)

721
00:45:32,731 --> 00:45:35,250
They dream 'bout
controlling me (Mm-mm)

722
00:45:36,427 --> 00:45:39,757
Sad you went so cold on me,
come hold on me (Mm-mm)

723
00:45:39,993 --> 00:45:41,686
You've been distant

724
00:45:42,081 --> 00:45:43,937
I wanna give us a shot, please
(Shot)

725
00:45:44,269 --> 00:45:46,837
Give me, give me,

I wanna give us a shot, please

728
00:45:51,633 --> 00:45:54,414
Give me, give me,
give me ammunition

729
00:45:55,007 --> 00:45:59,455
Can we just go back to when
I still believed in it?

730
00:46:01,649 --> 00:46:06,883
'Cause if you got me way back,
then life could've been different

731
00:46:08,844 --> 00:46:14,097
I'd probably be livin' with you
but after all I been through, I

732
00:46:16,678 --> 00:46:18,860
I get nervous when
you're swerving me

733
00:46:19,094 --> 00:46:20,916
Can't think about you hurting me

734
00:46:21,071 --> 00:46:24,167
I need you to prove your worth

735
00:46:24,315 --> 00:46:25,653
You've been distant

736
00:46:26,387 --> 00:46:28,980
I wanna give us a shot, please

737
00:46:29,242 --> 00:46:31,283
Give me ammunition

738

I wanna give us a shot,

740
00:46:37,153 --> 00:46:40,808

Give me ammunition (Shot)

747
00:46:57,970 --> 00:47:01,510
Give me ammunition (Shot)

748
00:47:01,640 --> 00:47:05,144
Give me ammunition (Shot)

749
00:47:05,276 --> 00:47:08,931
Give me ammunition (Shot)

750
00:47:09,083 --> 00:47:11,718
Gimme, gimme, gimme,
gimme, gimme, gimme,

751
00:47:11,858 --> 00:47:14,179
Gimme, gimme
gimme, gimme, gimme,

752
00:47:14,325 --> 00:47:16,285
Gimme, gimme, gimme,
gimme, gimme

753
00:47:16,437 --> 00:47:18,167
Love me, love me,
kiss me, touch me

754
00:47:18,303 --> 00:47:20,009
Kiss me, touch me,
touch me, touch me

755
00:47:20,166 --> 00:47:21,824
Love me, love me,
kiss me, touch me

756
00:47:23,561 --> 00:47:27,089
Love me, love me,
kiss me, touch me

757
00:47:27,465 --> 00:47:30,611
Love me, love me, I wanna
give us a shot (Shot)

758
00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:34,478
Love me, love me,
kiss me, touch me

759
00:47:34,727 --> 00:47:38,150
Love me, love me,
kiss me, touch me

760
00:47:38,608 --> 00:47:41,736
Love me, love me,
kiss me, touch me

761
00:47:42,250 --> 00:47:45,450
Love me, love me, I wanna
give us a shot (Shot)

762
00:47:46,130 --> 00:47:49,493
Love me, love me,
kiss me, touch me

763
00:47:49,707 --> 00:47:53,053
Love me, love me,
kiss me, touch me

764
00:48:06,118 --> 00:48:09,304
This one, this one

765
00:48:11,112 --> 00:48:16,955
goes out to that one friend
who would just not listen.

766
00:48:19,028 --> 00:48:21,817
Ugh. You try to tell them,

767
00:48:22,315 --> 00:48:24,248
You say they're not
good for you, you know.

768
00:48:24,830 --> 00:48:26,319
You deserve
someone better.

769
00:48:28,014 --> 00:48:29,119
And they just say:

770
00:48:29,241 --> 00:48:32,700
"but I love them, you
don't get it, I love them".

771
00:48:40,380 --> 00:48:42,186
You feel me, Amsterdam?

772
00:48:47,594 --> 00:48:49,923
You're so in love with him, it's tragic

773
00:48:50,252 --> 00:48:54,892
You just wanna have
him all to yourself (Ah)

774
00:48:55,101 --> 00:48:57,534
And to your family,
he's perfect

775
00:48:57,769 --> 00:49:02,490
But behind the curtains,
he's someone else (Ah)

776
00:49:02,660 --> 00:49:06,065
When will you use your
common sense?

777
00:49:06,224 --> 00:49:10,394
He drags you down instead
of compliments

778
00:49:10,599 --> 00:49:13,738
You know he ain't Heaven-sent

779
00:49:13,930 --> 00:49:18,539
No, he ain't Heaven-sent,
look at the evidence. Sing!

780
00:49:18,660 --> 00:49:20,155
Girl, give him up

781
00:49:20,493 --> 00:49:22,614
I'm tellin' you as a friend

782
00:49:22,762 --> 00:49:25,321
What he's putting you
through is too much

783
00:49:25,539 --> 00:49:27,717
I told you enough

784
00:49:27,916 --> 00:49:30,075
But you don't wanna listen

785
00:49:30,242 --> 00:49:32,798
You just tell me,
"You love who you love"

786
00:49:32,990 --> 00:49:36,439
Won't be long,
it's a matter of time

787
00:49:36,763 --> 00:49:40,130
Till you call me 'cause
he made you cry

788
00:49:40,579 --> 00:49:42,745
Enough is enough

789
00:49:42,968 --> 00:49:45,003
'Cause you don't wanna listen

790
00:49:45,231 --> 00:49:47,697
You just tell me, "You
love who you love"

791
00:49:51,252 --> 00:49:53,835
It's like we goin'
'round in circles

792
00:49:54,029 --> 00:49:58,428
He does this on purpose
to keep you near (Ah)

793
00:49:58,782 --> 00:50:02,391
This toxic love makin' you
feel like you're insane

794
00:50:02,633 --> 00:50:06,088
He promised you he was
gonna change, but he's the same

795
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:09,641
When will you use your
common sense?

796
00:50:09,929 --> 00:50:14,261
He drags you down instead
of compliments

797
00:50:14,442 --> 00:50:17,265
You know he ain't Heaven-sent

798
00:50:17,438 --> 00:50:21,607
No, he ain't Heaven-sent,
look at the evidence

799
00:50:21,784 --> 00:50:23,830
Girl, give him up

800
00:50:24,244 --> 00:50:26,316
I'm tellin' you as a friend

801
00:50:26,502 --> 00:50:29,164
What he's putting you
through is too much

802
00:50:29,367 --> 00:50:31,511
I told you enough

803
00:50:31,716 --> 00:50:33,719
But you don't wanna listen

804
00:50:33,910 --> 00:50:36,584
You just tell me, "You
love who you love"

805
00:50:36,740 --> 00:50:40,098
Won't be long,
it's a matter of time

806
00:50:40,488 --> 00:50:43,945
Till you call me 'cause
he made you cry

807
00:50:44,301 --> 00:50:46,509
Enough is enough

808
00:50:46,764 --> 00:50:48,603
'Cause you don't wanna listen

809
00:50:48,849 --> 00:50:51,604
You just tell me, "You
love who you love"

810
00:50:55,049 --> 00:50:58,700
Maybe one day, you will
finally understand

811
00:50:59,412 --> 00:51:02,924
That if you're lookin' for
love, he isn't the man

812
00:51:03,124 --> 00:51:05,876
I sound like a broken record

813
00:51:06,065 --> 00:51:12,794
But you need to figure it out

814
00:51:14,827 --> 00:51:18,043
Girl, give him up

815
00:51:18,621 --> 00:51:20,729
I'm tellin' you as a friend

816
00:51:20,921 --> 00:51:23,486
What he's putting you
through is too much

817
00:51:23,735 --> 00:51:25,807
I told you enough

818
00:51:26,008 --> 00:51:28,208
But you don't wanna listen

819
00:51:28,374 --> 00:51:30,962
You just tell me, "You
love who you love"

820
00:51:31,161 --> 00:51:34,412
Won't be long,
it's a matter of time

821
00:51:34,915 --> 00:51:38,666
Till you call me
'cause he made you cry

822
00:51:38,832 --> 00:51:40,965
Enough is enough

823
00:51:41,162 --> 00:51:43,225
'Cause you don't wanna listen

824
00:51:43,481 --> 00:51:46,044
You just tell me,
"You love who you love"

825
00:51:58,648 --> 00:52:00,055
Oh my, oh my, oh my

826
00:52:02,012 --> 00:52:03,544
Oh my, oh my, oh my

827
00:52:05,345 --> 00:52:09,731
Oh my, oh my, oh my
oh my (Hahahahaha)

828
00:52:10,107 --> 00:52:13,325
It ain't my fault you
keep turnin' me on

829
00:52:13,636 --> 00:52:16,645
It ain't my fault you got,
got me so gone

830
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:20,202
It ain't my fault I'm
not leavin' alone

831
00:52:20,442 --> 00:52:23,359
It ain't my fault you
keep turnin' me on

832
00:52:23,552 --> 00:52:24,443
I can't talk right now

833
00:52:24,572 --> 00:52:25,726
I'm lookin' and I like
what I'm seein',

834
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:26,961
got me feelin' kinda
shocked right now

835
00:52:27,115 --> 00:52:28,065
Couldn't stop right now

836
00:52:28,265 --> 00:52:30,530
Even if I wanted, gotta get it, get it,
get it when it's hot right now

837
00:52:30,714 --> 00:52:32,166
Oh my God, what is this?

838
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:33,743
Want you all in my business

839
00:52:33,912 --> 00:52:34,777
Baby, I insist

840
00:52:34,968 --> 00:52:37,761
Please don't blame me for
whatever happens next

841
00:52:38,030 --> 00:52:41,266
No, I-I-I-I can't be responsible

842
00:52:41,509 --> 00:52:44,513
If I-I-I-I get you in trouble now

843
00:52:44,902 --> 00:52:47,971
See, you're too irresistible

844
00:52:48,363 --> 00:52:50,298
Yeah, that's for sure

845
00:52:50,537 --> 00:52:54,053
So, if I put your hands
where my eyes can't see

846
00:52:54,247 --> 00:52:57,306
Then you're the one
who's got a hold on me

847
00:52:58,414 --> 00:53:01,372
No, I-I-I-I can't be responsible

848
00:53:02,018 --> 00:53:03,125
Responsible

849
00:53:03,612 --> 00:53:04,873
It ain't my fault

850
00:53:05,194 --> 00:53:08,089
Nope, nope, nope, nope

851
00:53:08,296 --> 00:53:10,505
Nope, nope, nope

852
00:53:10,667 --> 00:53:11,654

Nope, nope, nope

00:53:17,521 --> 00:53:18,171
It ain't my fault

856
00:53:18,398 --> 00:53:21,186
It ain't my fault you
came here lookin' like that

857
00:53:21,411 --> 00:53:24,542
You just made me trip,
fall and land on your lap

858
00:53:24,712 --> 00:53:28,080
Certain bad boy smooth,
body hotter than a summer

859
00:53:28,222 --> 00:53:31,499
I don't mean to be rude, but
I'd look so damn good on ya

860
00:53:31,668 --> 00:53:32,746
Ain't got time right now

861
00:53:32,925 --> 00:53:35,191
Missed me with that "What's
your name, your sign" right now

862
00:53:35,353 --> 00:53:36,224
It's light outside

863
00:53:36,391 --> 00:53:38,531
I just called an Uber
and it's right outside

864
00:53:38,702 --> 00:53:40,294
Oh my God, what is this?

865
00:53:40,455 --> 00:53:41,865
Want you all in my business

866
00:53:42,031 --> 00:53:42,977

874
00:54:06,675 --> 00:54:09,302
No, I-I-I-I can't be responsible

00:54:10,094 --> 00:54:11,261
Responsible

876
00:54:11,706 --> 00:54:12,883
It ain't my fault

877
00:54:13,078 --> 00:54:16,226
Nope, nope, nope, nope

878
00:54:16,583 --> 00:54:18,626
Nope, nope, nope

879
00:54:18,785 --> 00:54:19,712
It ain't my fault

880
00:54:20,053 --> 00:54:22,991
Nope, nope, nope, nope

881
00:54:23,232 --> 00:54:25,462
Nope, nope, nope

882
00:54:26,007 --> 00:54:28,748
Baby, one, two, three

883
00:54:29,195 --> 00:54:32,052
Your body's callin' me

884
00:54:32,334 --> 00:54:34,446
And I know wherever you're at

885
00:54:34,657 --> 00:54:37,462
Is exactly where I wanna be

886
00:54:37,722 --> 00:54:39,085
But don't blame me

887
00:54:39,239 --> 00:54:43,423
It ain't my fault, no

888
00:54:43,802 --> 00:54:47,255
No (Nope, nope, nope, nope
It ain't my fault)

889
00:54:47,424 --> 00:54:50,523
No (Nope, nope, nope, nope
It ain't my fault)

890
00:54:50,748 --> 00:54:53,890
Hey (Nope, nope, nope, nope
It ain't my fault)

891
00:54:54,139 --> 00:54:57,874
(Nope, nope, nope, it ain't my fault)
Well, that's too bad it ain't my fault.

892
00:55:06,575 --> 00:55:11,215
Alright, let's slow it down,
get a little sexy here.

893
00:55:31,507 --> 00:55:37,639
Feel, I feel myself fallin'

894
00:55:38,467 --> 00:55:45,967
All the blood rushed
to my head, mm-mm

895
00:55:46,836 --> 00:55:51,609
Knee-deep into emotion

896
00:55:51,862 --> 00:56:00,187
And you make me want
to sink to oblivion

897
00:56:02,489 --> 00:56:09,179
I want your love
to roll the dice

898
00:56:10,042 --> 00:56:12,918
I put it all on you and I

899
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:17,768
Until the end of time

900
00:56:18,072 --> 00:56:24,826
I want your love
to start a fire

901
00:56:25,177 --> 00:56:28,659
And keep it burnin'
through the night

902
00:56:28,968 --> 00:56:33,178
Baby, until the end of time

903
00:56:33,436 --> 00:56:37,697
They will say that we're insane

904
00:56:38,998 --> 00:56:39,989
Hey!

905
00:56:40,166 --> 00:56:46,910
And in a way, baby,
we are, mm-mm

906
00:56:47,492 --> 00:56:51,148
When you pull me close
underneath that light

907
00:56:51,344 --> 00:56:54,794
From the moment I looked
into your eyes

908
00:56:54,949 --> 00:57:00,294
Saw what I'd been searchin'
for all of this time

909
00:57:00,610 --> 00:57:03,059
This time, oh

910
00:57:03,229 --> 00:57:06,395
I want your love
(I want your love)

911
00:57:06,651 --> 00:57:09,557
To roll the dice
(To roll the dice)

912
00:57:09,916 --> 00:57:13,110
I put it all on you and I

913
00:57:13,507 --> 00:57:17,565
Until the end of time

914
00:57:17,754 --> 00:57:21,416
I want your love
(I want your love)

915
00:57:21,613 --> 00:57:24,747
To start a fire
(To start a fire)

916
00:57:24,935 --> 00:57:28,108
And keep it burnin'
through the night

917
00:57:28,444 --> 00:57:32,500
Baby, until the end of time

918
00:57:47,504 --> 00:57:54,015
I want your love
to redefine

919
00:57:54,489 --> 00:57:58,183
The very meaning of my life

920
00:57:58,447 --> 00:58:02,196
Undo the fabric of my mind

921
00:58:02,395 --> 00:58:05,791
I want your love

922
00:58:06,065 --> 00:58:09,119
To start a fire

923
00:58:09,361 --> 00:58:12,859
And keep it burnin'
through the night

924
00:58:13,077 --> 00:58:18,063
Until the end, the end, the
end of fucking time

925
00:58:18,291 --> 00:58:22,688
La, la, la-la, la, la, la-la-la

926
00:58:22,884 --> 00:58:26,466
La, la, la-la, la, la, la-la-la

927
00:58:26,668 --> 00:58:30,086
La, la, la-la, la, la, la-la-la

928
00:58:30,282 --> 00:58:33,827
La, la, la-la, la, la, la-la-la

929
00:58:34,062 --> 00:58:37,696
La, la, la-la, la, la, la-la-la

930
00:58:37,926 --> 00:58:41,190
La, la, la-la, la, la, la-la-la

931
00:58:41,412 --> 00:58:44,958
La, la, la-la, la, la, la-la-la

932
00:58:45,193 --> 00:58:47,162
La, la, la-la, la

933
00:58:51,197 --> 00:58:54,999
Until the end, until the end,
until the end of time

934
00:59:06,347 --> 00:59:09,868
Until the end, until the end,
until the end of time

935
00:59:21,161 --> 00:59:24,919
Until the end, until the end,
until the end of time

936
01:01:22,100 --> 01:01:27,113
I don't need the time to
make up my mind (Yeah, yeah)

937
01:01:27,508 --> 01:01:30,286
That's on my love (Yeah)

938
01:01:31,042 --> 01:01:37,168
That's on my love, yeah (Yeah)

939
01:01:37,602 --> 01:01:41,217
Hear my pain, can you
hear my prayer?

940
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:45,222
Take my breath, can
you take me there?

941
01:01:46,676 --> 01:01:51,907
That's on my love, yeah, yeah

942
01:01:52,080 --> 01:01:55,502
Into the dark, into the
light, baby, I go

943
01:01:55,721 --> 01:01:59,190
Whether it's wrong, whether
it's right, I will follow

944
01:01:59,528 --> 01:02:02,225
I'll pay the price, I'll sacrifice

945
01:02:02,457 --> 01:02:07,042
That's on my love, yeah

946
01:02:07,435 --> 01:02:09,941
On my love, on my love

947
01:02:10,173 --> 01:02:13,814
I put that on my, on
my love, on my love

948
01:02:14,043 --> 01:02:17,540
I put that on my love

949
01:02:18,007 --> 01:02:21,438

01:02:22,873 --> 01:02:25,481
On my love, on my love

01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:29,489
I put that on my, on
my love, on my love

952

That's on my love

956
01:02:55,495 --> 01:03:00,418
I still need you deep
in my heart (Yeah, yeah)

957

That's on my love (Yeah)

01:03:11,235 --> 01:03:14,562
You're the one thing
I can't escape

960
01:03:15,144 --> 01:03:20,076
You're the fire to my
warm embrace, yeah

961
01:03:20,506 --> 01:03:23,293
That's on my love

962
01:03:25,485 --> 01:03:29,192
Into the dark, into the
light, baby, I go

963
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:33,119
Whether it's wrong, whether
it's right, I will follow

964
01:03:33,334 --> 01:03:36,049
I'll pay the price,
I'll sacrifice

965
01:03:36,378 --> 01:03:39,240
That's on my love

969
01:03:51,601 --> 01:03:55,104
I put that on my love

970
01:04:12,457 --> 01:04:14,860
On my love, on my love

971
01:04:16,220 --> 01:04:18,793
On my love, on my love

01:04:20,272 --> 01:04:22,553
On my love, on my love

973
01:04:24,095 --> 01:04:26,482
On my love, on my love

974
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,416
On my love, on my love

I put that on my love

981
01:04:54,116 --> 01:04:57,233
I put that on my love

982
01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:15,034
It's party time!

983
01:05:16,778 --> 01:05:18,776
I wanna see everybody
up on their feet.

984
01:05:21,035 --> 01:05:22,980
Let's get moving, baby!

985
01:05:26,813 --> 01:05:30,094
C'mon, Amsterdam,
sing this one with me.

986
01:05:31,902 --> 01:05:34,074
I live my day as
if it was the last

987
01:05:34,510 --> 01:05:36,489
Live my day as if
there was no past

988
01:05:36,938 --> 01:05:39,046
Doin' it all night, all summer

989
01:05:39,453 --> 01:05:41,449
Doin' it the way I wanna

990
01:05:41,813 --> 01:05:44,221
Yeah, I'ma dance my heart
out 'til the dawn

991
01:05:44,492 --> 01:05:46,484
But I won't be done
when mornin' comes

992
01:05:46,824 --> 01:05:48,797
Doin' it all night, all summer

993
01:05:49,222 --> 01:05:51,896
Gonna spend it like no other

994
01:05:52,973 --> 01:05:54,153
It was a crush

995
01:05:54,416 --> 01:05:56,656
But I couldn't,
couldn't get enough

996
01:05:57,484 --> 01:05:58,981
It was a rush

997
01:05:59,176 --> 01:06:00,692
But I gave it up

998
01:06:02,564 --> 01:06:04,129
It was a crush

999
01:06:04,343 --> 01:06:06,293
Now, I might've went
and said too much

1000
01:06:07,388 --> 01:06:08,873
But that's all it was

1001
01:06:09,061 --> 01:06:10,579
So I gave it up

1002
01:06:11,080 --> 01:06:13,457
I live my day as if
it was the last

1003
01:06:13,670 --> 01:06:15,831
Live my day as if
there was no past

1004
01:06:16,110 --> 01:06:18,236
Doin' it all night, all summer

1005
01:06:18,506 --> 01:06:20,623
Doin' it the way I wanna

1006
01:06:21,010 --> 01:06:23,383
Yeah, I'ma dance my
heart out 'til the dawn

1007
01:06:23,591 --> 01:06:25,679
But I won't be done
when mornin' comes

1008
01:06:25,879 --> 01:06:28,014
Doin' it all night, all summer

1009
01:06:28,216 --> 01:06:30,955
Gonna spend it like no other

1010
01:06:31,965 --> 01:06:33,356
It was a crush

1011
01:06:33,554 --> 01:06:35,935
I kept sayin',
"I'ma stay in touch"

1012
01:06:36,778 --> 01:06:38,384
But that thing went bust

1013
01:06:38,604 --> 01:06:41,389
So I gave it up, ooh

1014
01:06:41,704 --> 01:06:43,262
No tricks, no bluff

1015
01:06:43,455 --> 01:06:45,524
I'm just better off
without them cuffs

1016
01:06:45,741 --> 01:06:47,818
Yeah, the sun won't set on us

1017
01:06:47,994 --> 01:06:51,423
Ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah

1018
01:06:51,801 --> 01:06:54,144
Went low, went high

1019
01:06:54,346 --> 01:06:56,890
Still waters run dry

1020
01:06:57,098 --> 01:06:59,312
Gotta get back in the groove

1021
01:06:59,607 --> 01:07:01,220
I ain't ever worried

1022
01:07:01,615 --> 01:07:03,900
Went low, went high

1023
01:07:04,116 --> 01:07:06,715
What matters is now

1024
01:07:07,009 --> 01:07:09,032
Gettin' right back in the mood

1025
01:07:09,806 --> 01:07:12,222
I live my day as if
it was the last

1026
01:07:12,463 --> 01:07:14,704
Live my day as if
there was no past

1027
01:07:14,887 --> 01:07:17,052
Doin' it all night, all summer

1028
01:07:17,292 --> 01:07:19,324
Doin' it the way I wanna

1029
01:07:19,563 --> 01:07:22,041
Yeah, I'ma dance my
heart out 'til the dawn

1030
01:07:22,228 --> 01:07:24,479
But I won't be done
when mornin' comes

1031
01:07:24,655 --> 01:07:26,847
Doin' it all night, all summer

1032
01:07:27,045 --> 01:07:29,840
Gonna spend it like no other

1033
01:07:30,331 --> 01:07:32,498
Now I've found another crush

1034
01:07:32,713 --> 01:07:34,942
The lush life's given me a rush

1035
01:07:35,359 --> 01:07:37,354
Had one chance to make me blush

1036
01:07:37,728 --> 01:07:39,320
Second time is one too late

1037
01:07:40,163 --> 01:07:42,476
Now I've found another crush

1038
01:07:42,681 --> 01:07:44,850
The lush life's given me a rush

1039
01:07:45,027 --> 01:07:47,349
Had one chance to make me blush

1040
01:07:47,540 --> 01:07:49,023
Second time is one too late

1041
01:07:50,716 --> 01:07:55,768
Please, give it up for
my incredible band

1042
01:08:00,056 --> 01:08:03,315
and for my amazing dancers,

1043
01:08:05,532 --> 01:08:07,833
for the lightning and the sound.

1044
01:08:10,246 --> 01:08:11,892
Thank you so much for tonight.

1045
01:08:12,040 --> 01:08:14,079
 You guys have been
absolutely incredible.

1046
01:08:15,060 --> 01:08:16,818
Are you with me on
the last chorus?

1047
01:08:18,338 --> 01:08:20,667
I live my day as if it was the last

1048
01:08:21,049 --> 01:08:23,153
Live my day as if there was no past

1049
01:08:23,322 --> 01:08:25,510
Doin' it all night, all summer

Yeah, I'ma dance my heart

1052
01:08:30,883 --> 01:08:33,050
But I won't be done when mornin' comes

1053
01:08:33,228 --> 01:08:35,580
Doin' it all night, all summer

1054
01:08:35,777 --> 01:08:38,104
Gonna spend it like no other

1055
01:08:41,431 --> 01:08:43,536
Now I've found another crush

1056
01:08:43,873 --> 01:08:46,118
The lush life's given me a rush

1057
01:08:46,339 --> 01:08:48,494
Had one chance to make me blush

1058
01:08:48,722 --> 01:08:50,417
Second time is one too late

1059
01:08:51,108 --> 01:08:53,284
Now I've found another crush

1060
01:08:53,575 --> 01:08:55,888
The lush life's given me a rush

1061
01:08:56,218 --> 01:08:58,254
Had one chance to make me blush

1062
01:08:58,593 --> 01:09:00,170
Second time is one too late

1063
01:09:03,372 --> 01:09:05,531
Thank you so much, Amsterdam

1064
01:09:06,503 --> 01:09:08,619
I got one more song for you,

1065
01:09:09,486 --> 01:09:12,566
'cause I know you're wild and crazy

1066
01:09:12,891 --> 01:09:14,469
and I can't tame you.

1067
01:09:20,492 --> 01:09:21,661
You ready?

1068
01:09:33,327 --> 01:09:35,637
Don't need no one, she
can dance on her own

1069
01:09:35,929 --> 01:09:38,260
Club is closin', but she
ain't goin' home

1070
01:09:38,498 --> 01:09:40,915
Night is still young, where
the hell will she go?

1071
01:09:41,295 --> 01:09:43,551
Nobody knows, nobody knows

1072
01:09:43,873 --> 01:09:46,367
Ain't the first time 'cause
I've seen her before

1073
01:09:46,597 --> 01:09:48,890
Smell her perfume as she walks
through the door

1074
01:09:49,233 --> 01:09:51,516
I wanna know, where the
hell will she go?

1075
01:09:51,796 --> 01:09:54,749
Nobody knows, nobody,
nobody knows

1076
01:09:56,224 --> 01:09:58,776
No, you can't tame the girl

1077
01:09:58,995 --> 01:10:01,291
'Cause she runs her own world

1078
01:10:01,744 --> 01:10:04,280

Can't tame her

1085

No, no, no

1086
01:10:28,690 --> 01:10:31,003
Can't tame her magic energy

1087
01:10:31,203 --> 01:10:35,968
She's so magnetic, pulls you in
every time (Every time)

1088

Every time (Every time)

1089

But she don't care, she gonna
