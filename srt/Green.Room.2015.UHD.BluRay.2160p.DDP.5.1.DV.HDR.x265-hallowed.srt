1
00:00:56,349 --> 00:00:57,392
Shit.

2
00:01:03,398 --> 00:01:04,398
Sam.

3
00:01:05,066 --> 00:01:06,568
- Hm?
- Sam, wake up.

4
00:01:07,235 --> 00:01:08,278
What's wrong?

5
00:01:12,282 --> 00:01:13,700
What'd you do, Tiger?

6
00:01:14,951 --> 00:01:17,412
We didn't crash?
- You tell us, asshole.

7
00:01:18,246 --> 00:01:20,582
I guess I fell asleep.
- Yeah.

8
00:01:20,999 --> 00:01:22,709
With the engine running.

9
00:01:26,087 --> 00:01:28,673
Fully charged.
Did you kill the battery, too?

10
00:01:28,798 --> 00:01:30,008
You hear the radio?

11
00:01:35,388 --> 00:01:40,268
There's a skating rink about 11 miles
from here. Big parking lot.

12
00:01:40,852 --> 00:01:42,854
Ice skating or roller skating?

13
00:01:43,313 --> 00:01:44,981
Just says they're open. Why?

14
00:01:45,231 --> 00:01:46,899
Hockey players whoop more ass.

15
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:49,670
I don't know, dude. I've seen some
pretty bad-ass roller skaters.

16
00:01:49,694 --> 00:01:53,281
At seven am?
All right. I'll come with.

17
00:03:36,175 --> 00:03:37,260
Sam?
- Tad.

18
00:03:37,385 --> 00:03:40,555
Awesome. Hey, uh, I work nights,
but I'll catch up with you guys for breakfast.

19
00:03:40,638 --> 00:03:41,431
Okay.

20
00:03:41,556 --> 00:03:45,309
I'm in 2-R up the stairs. Just crash
wherever. Uh, park in the side lot.

21
00:03:45,685 --> 00:03:47,705
Rear doors touch the wall
so no one steals your shit.

22
00:03:47,729 --> 00:03:49,897
All right. Yeah?

23
00:04:07,957 --> 00:04:09,250
These all have mushrooms.

24
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:11,460
This dude's legit.

25
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:15,798
Why, 'cause he wakes up at
five in the morning to put jizz in his hair?

26
00:04:16,591 --> 00:04:19,594
Mm. No, he's true.

27
00:04:25,141 --> 00:04:26,141
Riri.

28
00:04:28,936 --> 00:04:29,937
Who are you callin'?

29
00:04:30,563 --> 00:04:31,939
Is it your business?

30
00:04:32,064 --> 00:04:33,107
I get the bills.

31
00:04:34,066 --> 00:04:35,151
I'm goin' to bed.

32
00:04:35,902 --> 00:04:37,111
We're gonna drink.

33
00:05:04,472 --> 00:05:06,140
Morning.
- Morning.

34
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,760
You the first to fall asleep?

35
00:05:19,821 --> 00:05:23,241
Okay, I'm with The Ain't Rights
from Washington, D.C.

36
00:05:23,366 --> 00:05:25,046
Uh, technically,
we're from Arlington.

37
00:05:25,243 --> 00:05:28,246
Nice. Uh, and this is
for Seaside HCFM.

38
00:05:28,538 --> 00:05:29,538
Not for The Zine?

39
00:05:30,164 --> 00:05:33,044
I'll do a print version for that,
but this'll run on our college station.

40
00:05:33,084 --> 00:05:35,086
- Uh, if that's cool.
- Yeah.

41
00:05:35,586 --> 00:05:37,880
So, you guys working on
anything new?

42
00:05:37,964 --> 00:05:41,092
Hm, yeah. A few songs.
Maybe enough for, like, a seven inch.

43
00:05:41,175 --> 00:05:42,885
Sweet. Will you actually press one?

44
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:44,053
Yeah, if we can afford it.

45
00:05:44,345 --> 00:05:47,557
Yeah, no, I really dig the analogue style.
Uh, which brings me to the fact...

46
00:05:47,682 --> 00:05:48,975
you guys are hard to find.

47
00:05:49,475 --> 00:05:50,852
Why no social media presence?

48
00:05:51,143 --> 00:05:55,231
That's because booking more shows,
selling more records would blow.

49
00:05:55,356 --> 00:05:56,691
It's not hard rock.

50
00:05:56,816 --> 00:06:02,864
No one wants to starve, but when you
take it all virtual, you lose...

51
00:06:04,365 --> 00:06:07,285
good texture.
- What do you mean texture? - Just...

52
00:06:08,119 --> 00:06:14,500
You gotta be there. The music is for effect.
It's time and aggression.

53
00:06:14,584 --> 00:06:15,793
Technical wizardry.

54
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:24,093
And it's shared live... and then it's over.
The energy can't last.

55
00:06:24,886 --> 00:06:27,305
- Unless you're Iggy Pop.
- Yeah, well good for him

56
00:06:27,388 --> 00:06:30,641
but I don't think I want to be in my 70s
still listening to Minor Threat.

57
00:06:30,725 --> 00:06:33,269
- Tiger does.
- I won't live to be 70, so...

58
00:06:34,687 --> 00:06:37,106
Okay, so, uh, this is a good seg
into one of my traditions.

59
00:06:37,189 --> 00:06:40,067
Uh, for each of you,
name your desert island band.

60
00:06:40,776 --> 00:06:41,776
Only one?

61
00:06:42,987 --> 00:06:47,283
If I were to say Black Sabbath,
would I get Ozzy and Dio?

62
00:06:47,408 --> 00:06:49,577
No caveats, just name the band.

63
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:50,660
Okay.

64
00:06:52,246 --> 00:06:54,790
Misfits.
No, The Damned.

65
00:06:55,249 --> 00:06:56,709
Umm...
- No, fuck it. Misfits.

66
00:06:56,792 --> 00:06:58,669
- Poison Idea.
- Cro-Mags.

67
00:06:58,753 --> 00:07:00,087
That's a good one, also.

68
00:07:00,463 --> 00:07:01,881
Okay, say something, dude.

69
00:07:02,798 --> 00:07:04,133
What about Steely Dan?

70
00:07:04,216 --> 00:07:06,302
- Hm, no, Candlebox.
- He's a Juggalo.

71
00:07:07,136 --> 00:07:10,431
Uh... Uh...
- Britney Spears?

72
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:13,785
Hey, hey, you're, you're...
you're gonna edit this, right?

73
00:07:13,809 --> 00:07:16,449
I can chop it up a bit.
- No, you should let it go raw, man.

74
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:19,899
Um, when is this gonna air?
Like maybe we should plug the show.

75
00:07:20,775 --> 00:07:22,026
Yeah, um...

76
00:07:24,904 --> 00:07:27,615
My last show at the
Muni Center didn't end well.

77
00:07:27,698 --> 00:07:30,826
Uh, lots of vomit, some fecal matter.

78
00:07:31,661 --> 00:07:33,781
The county commissioner got wind
and pulled my permit.

79
00:07:34,538 --> 00:07:35,957
You guys were already en route.

80
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:39,627
Nah, you gotta give us a kill fee.
- We went 90 miles out of our way.

81
00:07:39,752 --> 00:07:41,629
I've got a back-up lined up.

82
00:07:41,712 --> 00:07:45,675
Um, lunch, 50 percent cut on the door
and you guys would headline.

83
00:07:46,384 --> 00:07:47,510
Is anyone still on the bill?

84
00:07:48,803 --> 00:07:49,803
No.

85
00:07:57,353 --> 00:08:01,148
♪ I'm always broke, and I'm alone.
I ask myself...

86
00:08:01,273 --> 00:08:04,443
♪ What have I become?!

87
00:08:05,444 --> 00:08:07,488

♪ I ask myself what have I become?! ♪

90
00:08:23,129 --> 00:08:24,380
Turn that shit off.

91
00:08:30,845 --> 00:08:33,514
I gave you my cut, uh,
the house got theirs, but I didn't...

92
00:08:33,597 --> 00:08:35,808
Split four ways it's six bucks each.

93
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:39,437
Six eighty-seven.
Eighty-eight if you just round up.

94
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,522
You dipshit fashion-punk
clown mother fucker!

95
00:08:42,148 --> 00:08:43,816
Christ.
- Uh, easy there, Jujitsu.

96
00:08:43,899 --> 00:08:46,193
Yeah, we don't want to go to jail, too.

97
00:08:47,403 --> 00:08:50,239
- I think you just ended this tour.
- Fuck yes. Let's call it.

98
00:08:51,323 --> 00:08:53,784
All right.
So we'd have to beeline to D.C.

99
00:08:53,868 --> 00:08:56,513
We have enough for one tank.
We'd have to siphon the rest of the way.

100
00:08:56,537 --> 00:08:57,617
That's not a problem.

101
00:08:58,205 --> 00:08:59,498
We got rice and beans.

102
00:08:59,665 --> 00:09:01,917
We could head up north,
take the 80 all the way.

103
00:09:02,001 --> 00:09:03,294
What the fuck you doin', man?

104
00:09:04,295 --> 00:09:07,048
Let me call my cousin.
I can get you guys a solid gig.

105
00:09:07,506 --> 00:09:08,716
Where? Here?

106
00:09:08,841 --> 00:09:11,302
The scene's dead.
You'd have to dip down closer to Portland.

107
00:09:17,933 --> 00:09:19,393
I say we just gank his vinyl.

108
00:09:22,563 --> 00:09:28,611
All right. So all set. Uh, matinee tomorrow,
doors at one, you guys are on at three.

109
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:30,571
I texted the addy.
- How much?

110
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:33,240
Uh, three fifty. Minus your tab.

111
00:09:33,616 --> 00:09:37,161
And, um, just so you know, it's mostly
boots and braces down there.

112
00:09:37,286 --> 00:09:38,430
The skins?
There's some at every show.

113
00:09:38,454 --> 00:09:40,247
What? DMS? Sharp?

114
00:09:40,331 --> 00:09:44,210
Uh, right-wing, or technically ultra-left,
but not affiliated.

115
00:09:44,335 --> 00:09:45,669
But your cousin's cool?

116
00:09:45,753 --> 00:09:48,672
Yeah. Yeah, uh, don't talk politics,
but stick with Daniel.

117
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:52,718
I'd tag along, but he and his girl are coming
here to crash. Gotta vacuum and shit.

118
00:09:52,843 --> 00:09:56,514
So they're not like burning crosses or
anything, right? Like we just play rock.

119
00:09:56,806 --> 00:09:59,600
Uh, I'd play your earlier stuff,
heavier stuff.

120
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:04,772
I usually keep the originals, but, uh,
since this one never happened...

121
00:10:05,481 --> 00:10:06,721
Can I still run that interview?

122
00:10:06,941 --> 00:10:09,360
Yeah. What station is it on?

123
00:10:09,443 --> 00:10:13,114
Uh, FM 85.5, Breakfast of Champions.
Thanks.

124
00:10:13,197 --> 00:10:16,492
Yo, Tad-pole.
I'm sorry I almost obliterated you, man.

125
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:18,953
Not a problem.

126
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,206
Take it easy.

127
00:10:34,552 --> 00:10:36,428
At least the dude can draw.

128
00:10:41,142 --> 00:10:42,476
Yeah, it's pretty sweet.

129
00:10:50,776 --> 00:10:51,776
Yo, Pat.

130
00:10:54,029 --> 00:10:56,157
You know,
there's something I never told you.

131
00:10:58,033 --> 00:10:59,702
Or anyone, for that matter.

132
00:11:01,162 --> 00:11:02,162
What?

133
00:11:08,752 --> 00:11:10,963
Was that real? Ew.

134
00:11:11,172 --> 00:11:12,172
Open your window.

135
00:12:33,671 --> 00:12:34,671
You Tad's friends?

136
00:12:34,797 --> 00:12:37,174
Oh, he sent us. Are you cousin Dan?

137
00:12:37,508 --> 00:12:38,509
Daniel.

138
00:12:38,968 --> 00:12:41,808
You guys look hammered.
- One night at Tad's will do that to you.

139
00:12:41,887 --> 00:12:44,348
And if your girl's gonna be crashing...
- Don't mention that.

140
00:12:44,598 --> 00:12:46,684
Okay, I was just...
- Yeah, no worries whatsoever.

141
00:12:46,767 --> 00:12:48,927
Just shut the fuck up about him and me and her.
- Yeah.

142
00:12:49,103 --> 00:12:50,854
Drummer? Drummer?

143
00:12:54,817 --> 00:12:56,443
Using the house kit or using yours?

144
00:12:57,194 --> 00:12:58,112
I'll use mine.

145
00:12:58,195 --> 00:12:59,613
Okay, load-in's here.

146
00:13:02,283 --> 00:13:03,701
That's bullshit.

147
00:13:04,994 --> 00:13:07,162
Aren't Rights? Yeah.

148
00:13:23,595 --> 00:13:24,763
Stage the rest in here.

149
00:13:24,972 --> 00:13:27,659
Don't block the hallway. The owner doesn't
fuck around with the fire codes.

150
00:13:27,683 --> 00:13:29,768
Sound check in 15, you're on in 20.

151
00:13:30,019 --> 00:13:31,061
Got it.

152
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:40,820
Hey Tiger.

153
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:42,530
You okay?

154
00:13:43,115 --> 00:13:44,115
Yeah, I'm fine.

155
00:13:44,825 --> 00:13:46,160
Are these guys not creeps?

156
00:13:47,077 --> 00:13:48,287
They run a tight ship.

157
00:13:48,787 --> 00:13:50,331
Except it's a U-boat.

158
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:55,878
Hey y'all. I got a dumb idea.

159
00:14:00,716 --> 00:14:02,596
Where'd you say the power supply was?

160
00:14:02,718 --> 00:14:04,470

Hey, we're not, are we?

Thank you. That was a cover.

What should we do next?
- Coronary.

191
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:39,565
This one's a treat.

192
00:16:45,172 --> 00:16:46,256
Here.

193
00:16:51,803 --> 00:16:52,989
What happened to fire code?

194
00:16:53,013 --> 00:16:55,213
Yeah, sorry guys.
We had to make room for the headliner.

195
00:16:55,432 --> 00:16:56,183
Cowcatcher, right?

196
00:16:56,391 --> 00:16:59,269
Yes. Gotta clear out, okay? Here you are.

197
00:16:59,728 --> 00:17:03,774
And it's all there. And you guys
follow me? Okay? All right.

198
00:17:03,941 --> 00:17:08,153
I'll get you one more
for the road. Okay, come on.

199
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:10,656
You got that?

200
00:17:10,739 --> 00:17:12,175
I'll be careful. I understand.

201
00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:13,784
- Aw, shit. My phone...
- What?

202
00:17:13,992 --> 00:17:16,370
My phone. I, I'll catch up...
- I got you.

203
00:17:16,495 --> 00:17:17,704
Thanks.
- Yeah.

204
00:17:19,122 --> 00:17:21,208
- Excuse me, all.

205
00:17:28,006 --> 00:17:29,299
Holy shit.

206
00:17:29,424 --> 00:17:31,051
Call the cops.
- Fuck that.

207
00:17:31,635 --> 00:17:33,428
Hey, stop! Mother fuck!

208
00:17:34,846 --> 00:17:36,265
I told you to follow.

209
00:17:38,183 --> 00:17:40,227
- No!
- Go!

210
00:17:40,435 --> 00:17:41,436
Go, go, go!

211
00:17:41,687 --> 00:17:45,315
Uh, yeah. I, yes, I am. I don't know.
There's been a... been a stabbing!

212
00:17:45,649 --> 00:17:46,775
She... Whoa!

213
00:17:51,321 --> 00:17:53,031
God damn it!
- They didn't lock the door.

214
00:17:53,198 --> 00:17:54,366
They didn't lock the door!

215
00:17:54,449 --> 00:17:56,868
No! Don't talk and don't touch them.

216
00:17:57,077 --> 00:17:58,453
Stay put! It's fine.

217
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:00,789
What the fuck happened?!
- Just give me a minute.

218
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:03,000
Something terrible.

219
00:18:30,652 --> 00:18:31,903
Okay. It's okay.
- Shit.

220
00:18:31,987 --> 00:18:33,381
It's okay. Don't worry. Don't worry.

221
00:18:33,405 --> 00:18:35,525
Just get back inside.
- What the fuck's going on, man?

222
00:18:35,574 --> 00:18:37,868
Up, in the room. Hey, go! Go!

223
00:18:38,577 --> 00:18:40,370
Up the stairs. It's okay. Let's go.

224
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:47,419
Oh, what the fuck, man?
- It's okay, it's fine.

225
00:18:47,502 --> 00:18:48,502
Uh! Uh!

226
00:18:49,296 --> 00:18:50,296
Turn the PA down!

227
00:18:50,881 --> 00:18:52,567
You didn't lock the door.
- You were right there!

228
00:18:52,591 --> 00:18:54,176
Until I wasn't!
- Quiet!

229
00:18:57,346 --> 00:18:58,346
Hello?

230
00:18:59,514 --> 00:19:01,933
Yeah, we got cut off,
I was calling to report a stabbing.

231
00:19:04,061 --> 00:19:05,145
A stabbing.

232
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:28,168
Did you call Darcy?
- He's on his way. He knows about that.

233
00:19:29,336 --> 00:19:30,379
Not this.

234
00:19:30,504 --> 00:19:32,424
You can't keep us here, man.
You gotta let us go.

235
00:19:32,506 --> 00:19:34,341
We're not keeping you.
You're just staying.

236
00:19:36,259 --> 00:19:37,987
You're up.
- What the fuck that supposed to mean?

237
00:19:38,011 --> 00:19:39,012
Just relax!

238
00:19:40,305 --> 00:19:41,765
Everyone just relax.

239
00:19:42,349 --> 00:19:43,475
Cops are coming.

240
00:19:50,732 --> 00:19:54,277
See how easy that is?
- Mother fucker! What have you done?!

241
00:19:54,653 --> 00:19:56,693
- Amber, chill the fuck out!
- Yes, please.

242
00:20:01,743 --> 00:20:04,579
Darcy here?
- Not yet. I need six hundred cash.

243
00:20:05,163 --> 00:20:06,707
You just signed out three fifty.

244
00:20:07,582 --> 00:20:08,792
Somebody is dead.

245
00:20:11,753 --> 00:20:13,338
Still gotta keep the books.

246
00:20:19,219 --> 00:20:20,637
What else do you need?

247
00:20:21,263 --> 00:20:22,305
A true believer.

248
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:24,349
How 'bout two?

249
00:20:33,358 --> 00:20:35,360
Maybe she's not dead.

250
00:20:35,736 --> 00:20:36,945
I'm just saying...

251
00:20:37,154 --> 00:20:40,073
There's not a lot of blood, you know?
So like, maybe she's just...

252
00:20:41,241 --> 00:20:42,993
And who are we to say if she...

253
00:20:48,498 --> 00:20:50,125
Come on, man. What are you doing?

254
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:54,045
- Oh, fuck, man!

255
00:20:55,255 --> 00:20:56,255
There it is.

256
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:57,758
Oh my god.

257
00:21:04,181 --> 00:21:06,141
We gotta go.
We gotta fuckin' go right now.

258
00:21:07,184 --> 00:21:08,477
C'mon. We didn't see shit.

259
00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:11,313
We, we, we were so drunk...

260
00:21:11,563 --> 00:21:13,774
All right. Just wait, okay?

261
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:16,193
Cops are on the way.

262
00:21:17,527 --> 00:21:18,862
Above and beyond, gentlemen.

263
00:21:19,821 --> 00:21:21,531
You need me to do it?
- Nope.

264
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:24,159
- Won't even be the first time.

265
00:21:25,619 --> 00:21:26,619
Hurry up.

266
00:21:26,995 --> 00:21:28,663
- Go.

267
00:21:31,082 --> 00:21:32,501
All right. That's it.

268
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,129
Let them see it.

269
00:21:37,255 --> 00:21:38,255
The knife.

270
00:21:38,465 --> 00:21:41,825
It's an inch too short for felony possession,
so you don't have to worry about the...

271
00:21:42,803 --> 00:21:44,221
Actually, give me that money back.

272
00:21:44,304 --> 00:21:46,024
- What?
- It's like vouchers and shit.

273
00:21:46,139 --> 00:21:47,379
We'll hold it for you. Come on.

274
00:21:50,519 --> 00:21:52,479
If you do any time, we'll double it.

275
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:02,989
I'll talk to them.

276
00:22:09,204 --> 00:22:10,724
You the victim?
- Yes, officer.

277
00:22:11,164 --> 00:22:13,084
Kneel down,
both of you, ankles crossed.

278
00:22:18,213 --> 00:22:20,966
That's the owner.
I, uh, called him, too.

279
00:22:22,968 --> 00:22:25,804
All right, let's give 'em
some room to work, folks.

280
00:22:26,763 --> 00:22:27,803
Are you the owner?

281
00:22:28,557 --> 00:22:29,641
Yes, ma'am.

282
00:22:52,455 --> 00:22:54,165
Cowcatcher.
Clear out.

283
00:22:55,041 --> 00:22:56,751
Hey, where are the cops?

284
00:22:56,835 --> 00:22:58,628
- Get your stuff.
- What about us?

285
00:22:59,838 --> 00:23:03,758
- What are you doing?
- I'm sorting it out. Just hang tight, Amber.

286
00:23:14,769 --> 00:23:16,229
Your set was pretty good.

287
00:23:18,273 --> 00:23:19,273
What?

288
00:23:23,528 --> 00:23:26,823
What was the name of your
second to last song?

289
00:23:31,202 --> 00:23:33,163
Uh, To... Toxic Evolution.

290
00:23:35,957 --> 00:23:37,542
It's fucking hard, man.

291
00:23:39,586 --> 00:23:41,129
That's the one I did her to.

292
00:23:55,894 --> 00:23:57,812
All right.
Well he's got six bullets.

293
00:23:57,938 --> 00:23:59,689
For real?
- If we all go at once...

294
00:23:59,773 --> 00:24:01,566
Christ, hold off a second.
- For what?

295
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:03,777
- We haven't done anything.
- Doesn't matter.

296
00:24:03,902 --> 00:24:06,696
Okay.
They're called cartridges.

297
00:24:07,656 --> 00:24:12,369
The bullet is the part that enters
your brain if you keep talking shit.

298
00:24:13,244 --> 00:24:16,790
And this gun only has
five cartridges, not six.

299
00:24:17,499 --> 00:24:21,044
'Cause they're big as fuck
and only five fit the cylinder.

300
00:24:22,337 --> 00:24:27,092
So please shut the fuck up
and don't test me.

301
00:24:27,175 --> 00:24:28,677
Reece, you're making it worse.

302
00:24:28,927 --> 00:24:31,429
We sit.
And we wait.

303
00:24:32,681 --> 00:24:33,723
And we die.

304
00:24:33,848 --> 00:24:35,558
Not if you sit and you wait.

305
00:24:36,768 --> 00:24:39,270
It's just the one to 911 at 3:45.

306
00:24:39,354 --> 00:24:41,481
And then mine was at 3:47.
- You called?

307
00:24:42,107 --> 00:24:43,858
911 called back and I answered.

308
00:24:43,942 --> 00:24:47,028
Be clear. Who else knows besides...
You said Daniel's cousin.

309
00:24:47,529 --> 00:24:49,810
Tad. There was a text from him
last night with our address

310
00:24:49,864 --> 00:24:51,074
but he doesn't know anything.

311
00:24:51,157 --> 00:24:53,785
Except who they are, where they are

312
00:24:53,868 --> 00:24:56,746
and maybe where
they're supposed to be next.

313
00:24:57,539 --> 00:25:00,709
Fuck. Check emails.

314
00:25:01,167 --> 00:25:02,961
They played their set to the crowd.

315
00:25:03,044 --> 00:25:06,506
Then we'll assume the wide world knows.
And they'll be tracking that.

316
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:11,344
Give it to me. I was trying to buy some time
and contain this until we could...

317
00:25:11,428 --> 00:25:12,512
Contain?

318
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:16,725
It was pretty rapid fire.
- I appreciate your initiative

319
00:25:16,808 --> 00:25:18,685
and we all love Werm.

320
00:25:19,602 --> 00:25:20,770
He's a brother.

321
00:25:20,854 --> 00:25:23,148
Ah. Then you might have
visited him in prison.

322
00:25:24,691 --> 00:25:28,903
Makes a difference.
Now we're all in the stew.

323
00:25:30,071 --> 00:25:36,286
For an impulsive act.
For a selfish act. Under my roof.

324
00:25:38,121 --> 00:25:39,414
You see a way out of this?

325
00:25:40,582 --> 00:25:44,669
For them? No.
- We still have to find one.

326
00:25:48,882 --> 00:25:51,301
Okay. This is good.

327
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:58,850
No guns. You have a "no trespassing"
sign posted at the residence?

328
00:25:58,933 --> 00:26:00,185
We got "beware of dogs."

329
00:26:00,268 --> 00:26:01,728
That's better.

330
00:26:08,526 --> 00:26:10,278
Does anyone even know we're in here?

331
00:26:10,487 --> 00:26:13,156
No one who cares. Tad?

332
00:26:17,077 --> 00:26:18,995
I think we go.
- I think we go too.

333
00:26:21,873 --> 00:26:24,473
The next person that moves...
- Everyone okay?

334
00:26:25,794 --> 00:26:26,961
Just about.

335
00:26:27,754 --> 00:26:29,464
Gabe?
- Yeah, open up.

336
00:26:29,547 --> 00:26:30,715
No.
- Where are the cops?

337
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:32,300
Okay, do you want me
to open the door

338
00:26:32,383 --> 00:26:34,344
or do you want me
to blow your fucking head off?

339
00:26:34,469 --> 00:26:37,472
Back the fuck off!
- What's going on?

340
00:26:37,597 --> 00:26:38,657
They're trying to run at me!

341
00:26:38,681 --> 00:26:39,808
Do not shoot them.

342
00:26:39,891 --> 00:26:42,078
- You know what? That's on them.
- Where are the cops?

343
00:26:42,102 --> 00:26:43,103
Give them the gun.

344
00:26:44,437 --> 00:26:45,480
Say again?

345
00:26:46,397 --> 00:26:48,775
It's over. Give them the gun.

346
00:26:48,858 --> 00:26:52,529
Okay, I told you they just tried to run at me...
- Then take the bullets out!

347
00:26:52,612 --> 00:26:55,615
Just hand it over.
Now. Do not shoot them!

348
00:26:56,199 --> 00:26:57,450
Is Darcy here?

349
00:26:58,785 --> 00:27:00,328
- He is.
- I am.

350
00:27:01,496 --> 00:27:04,791
- Gentlemen, I'm the owner.
- Why the fuck didn't you just tell me...

351
00:27:04,916 --> 00:27:08,128
Truly sorry about this.
I'm playing catch-up here myself.

352
00:27:08,211 --> 00:27:09,963
They're playing a fucking show.

353
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:18,805
Uh, thank you. But we open the door
for the police. Or we keep the bullets.

354
00:27:19,764 --> 00:27:22,976
Uh, the cartridges.
- I've got no problem with that.

355
00:27:23,059 --> 00:27:26,896
Okay. I handed them the gun. I'm gonna head out now.
- No you're not.

356
00:27:27,021 --> 00:27:28,314
Let him open the door.
- Hang on.

357
00:27:28,398 --> 00:27:29,667
He gave us the gun.
He gave us the gun.

358
00:27:29,691 --> 00:27:31,442
Nobody is letting me do anything.

359
00:27:31,526 --> 00:27:34,445
I gave you the goddamn gun, okay?
- How we doing?

360
00:27:34,529 --> 00:27:36,656
He's right.
Pat, do the math.

361
00:27:37,574 --> 00:27:38,574
Where are the police?

362
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,452
- It takes a while out here.
- Stay back.

363
00:27:41,536 --> 00:27:45,123
I just want to be sure that
no one else gets hurt in the meantime.

364
00:27:45,206 --> 00:27:47,542
Okay. I gave you the damn gun.

365
00:27:52,255 --> 00:27:53,965
- Get off!

366
00:27:55,675 --> 00:27:57,969
Get him now! Get him now!

367
00:28:01,347 --> 00:28:02,390
What's happening?

368
00:28:08,229 --> 00:28:10,481
- Shh!
- Justin.

369
00:28:11,608 --> 00:28:13,234
Shouldn't have locked the door.

370
00:28:13,359 --> 00:28:14,485
Shit! Sam!

371
00:28:14,903 --> 00:28:16,112
Come on.

372
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,240
Get the bullets.

373
00:28:24,871 --> 00:28:26,849
Alright, load the gun.
- How's it going in there?

374
00:28:26,873 --> 00:28:31,002
- Not good!
- Fine! But we would rather wait for the police.

375
00:28:31,085 --> 00:28:32,545
Justin?

376
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:33,963
He's fine.

377
00:28:35,924 --> 00:28:37,342
But he's gonna wait, too.

378
00:28:40,845 --> 00:28:43,848
Understood, gentlemen. Okay.

379
00:28:46,726 --> 00:28:47,852
Think they know?

380
00:28:47,936 --> 00:28:49,979
I think they're smarter than you!

381
00:28:50,104 --> 00:28:51,105
Darcy.

382
00:28:52,023 --> 00:28:53,023
Man.

383
00:28:56,277 --> 00:28:57,654
I apologise.

384
00:29:00,573 --> 00:29:02,659
We'll do it here.
Stage it up the road.

385
00:29:10,416 --> 00:29:13,795
Hey, what was that gonzo shit, man?
- So, in a tournament

386
00:29:14,379 --> 00:29:17,382
I snap his arm or he taps out
and we all go get burgers.

387
00:29:17,507 --> 00:29:19,217
Snap it.
- Come on.

388
00:29:19,342 --> 00:29:22,502
Look we got the gun. Why don't we just let him...
- Wait. Wait. I don't want it.

389
00:29:22,595 --> 00:29:24,876
Alright? I don't, I don't feel good with it.
Who wants it?

390
00:29:25,431 --> 00:29:26,224
Not me.

391
00:29:26,349 --> 00:29:27,433
No, I, I can't shoot.

392
00:29:27,558 --> 00:29:29,269
I can.
- No, not you.

393
00:29:29,394 --> 00:29:32,146
Then fucking keep it.
- Keep it, Sam. I'll take it when I'm up.

394
00:29:32,897 --> 00:29:35,275
When I let go, what are you gonna do?

395
00:29:36,442 --> 00:29:37,819
Butt fuck everyone in the room.

396
00:29:39,737 --> 00:29:44,325
You're gonna say
"crisscross applesauce." Say it.

397
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:47,578
I'm gonna say crisscross apple sauce...

398
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:52,417
Nice.
- Now lean against the chair.

399
00:29:55,586 --> 00:29:57,297
Hey.
Is there another way out of here?

400
00:29:57,714 --> 00:29:58,714
No.

401
00:30:00,091 --> 00:30:01,217
You fed 'em yet today?

402
00:30:02,927 --> 00:30:05,179
It doesn't matter. They're professionals.

403
00:30:05,763 --> 00:30:08,099
You might lose a couple by morning.
Maybe a bunch.

404
00:30:08,182 --> 00:30:09,851
Like I said, they're pros.

405
00:30:10,768 --> 00:30:11,768
They earn.

406
00:30:11,811 --> 00:30:15,898
You'll be compensated.
Christ, how many people on that list?

407
00:30:20,403 --> 00:30:25,325
It's twelve hundred for a prospect,
two for a bait dog. No studs, no champs

408
00:30:25,408 --> 00:30:27,201
unless you want to pay
twenty grand a head.

409
00:30:27,285 --> 00:30:29,579
This might cost you your
livelihood, Clark.

410
00:30:30,246 --> 00:30:32,915
As long as it doesn't cost me mine,
you're covered.

411
00:30:34,334 --> 00:30:36,334
There are gonna be cops,
so clean up the residence.

412
00:30:36,377 --> 00:30:38,421
Maybe leave a roach in that ashtray.

413
00:30:39,005 --> 00:30:41,716
Put Daniel on that door and
bring the van around.

414
00:30:41,924 --> 00:30:44,177
Shit. Keys.

415
00:30:46,137 --> 00:30:48,473
In there with them, I guess. I don't know.
- We need 'em.

416
00:30:49,057 --> 00:30:50,850
I got a ton of shit to do.
- Go on.

417
00:30:51,809 --> 00:30:54,145
This is a fire hazard.

418
00:30:58,441 --> 00:31:00,234
I wouldn't put Daniel on the door.

419
00:31:00,318 --> 00:31:02,570
Fine. Plenty to do.

420
00:31:03,821 --> 00:31:04,822
Where's Daniel?

421
00:31:04,906 --> 00:31:06,783
He stepped out; I'm covering.

422
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,495
Everything okay?

423
00:31:17,377 --> 00:31:18,669
Meet me at the utility shed.

424
00:31:30,515 --> 00:31:31,724
This a new ride?

425
00:31:32,642 --> 00:31:37,063
Yeah. Just turning it over.
Think it's getting choked. Wrong filter.

426
00:31:37,146 --> 00:31:38,272
She's a beaut.

427
00:31:38,356 --> 00:31:39,273
What's up?

428
00:31:39,357 --> 00:31:41,984
Need some of the squad.
Red laces only.

429
00:31:42,568 --> 00:31:44,612
Tonight?
- Now. The list.

430
00:31:47,448 --> 00:31:50,326
This is everybody who knows?
- Yeah. Including the band.

431
00:31:50,410 --> 00:31:51,411
Knows what?

432
00:31:51,494 --> 00:31:53,830
Manageable.
From here on out

433
00:31:53,913 --> 00:31:57,458
not a single name gets added
unless they have red laces.

434
00:31:57,542 --> 00:31:58,960
That's 80 people in there.

435
00:31:59,210 --> 00:32:03,923
You plus four. Give Gabe the keys
in case we have to play valet.

436
00:32:06,092 --> 00:32:07,218
We're losing light.

437
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:12,098
- Got it?
- Yeah.

438
00:32:14,475 --> 00:32:16,310
Oh, watch out.
That could be asbestos.

439
00:32:16,853 --> 00:32:19,173
- It's not asbestos.
- You don't have a phone, do you?

440
00:32:19,355 --> 00:32:22,984
They took it. Hers too.

441
00:32:23,109 --> 00:32:25,570
I want to search her, okay?

442
00:32:30,783 --> 00:32:33,870
- Careful. That one could be a live wire.
- It's a speaker wire.

443
00:32:48,718 --> 00:32:49,844
What'd you find?

444
00:32:51,137 --> 00:32:55,892
Uh, <i>Fleisch</i> wolf?

445
00:32:57,977 --> 00:33:00,563
<i>Fleisch</i> means, uh, flesh or meat.

446
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:02,482
Like a <i>fleisch</i> salad. It's German.

447
00:33:03,065 --> 00:33:04,525
So meat-wolf?

448
00:33:04,609 --> 00:33:05,609
Yeah.

449
00:33:09,363 --> 00:33:11,324
This shit's solid.
- Great.

450
00:33:11,407 --> 00:33:12,487
There's nothing here.

451
00:33:14,952 --> 00:33:17,788
Okay. Empty out your pockets.

452
00:33:17,872 --> 00:33:19,081
Come search me, faggot.

453
00:33:20,416 --> 00:33:21,416
Just shoot him.

454
00:33:22,668 --> 00:33:23,920
Come on.

455
00:33:25,796 --> 00:33:26,923
Can I get up?

456
00:33:27,465 --> 00:33:28,508
On the chair.

457
00:33:30,218 --> 00:33:31,844
Slowly. Slowly.

458
00:33:50,530 --> 00:33:51,822
Turn 'em out.

459
00:33:55,034 --> 00:33:56,410
Come on, man. Other one.

460
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:04,293
Good call.

461
00:34:05,044 --> 00:34:06,212
Turn it out, for fuck's sake.

462
00:34:08,089 --> 00:34:10,049
What is that? Give that to me.
Hand it over.

463
00:34:11,551 --> 00:34:13,719
- Oops.
- Wait, was that a phone?

464
00:34:14,595 --> 00:34:17,473
Oh, shit. Point it,
point it at the door...

465
00:34:17,557 --> 00:34:19,660
- Oh, maybe it's the police. It's a raid.
- Are you serious?

466
00:34:19,684 --> 00:34:20,786
- Shhh.
- Fuck off, Ilsa!

467
00:34:20,810 --> 00:34:23,396
Yo, quiet. Okay Justin, don't move.
Nobody move.

468
00:34:23,479 --> 00:34:25,249
- Now if we get all behind...
- Nobody talk.

469
00:34:25,273 --> 00:34:26,399
Careful, now.

470
00:34:41,205 --> 00:34:42,498
Smoke this.

471
00:34:44,166 --> 00:34:45,166
Deal.

472
00:34:47,128 --> 00:34:51,465
And if the cheery does something
that you don't like, shoot.

473
00:34:53,092 --> 00:34:54,385
Thank you, Amber.

474
00:34:58,264 --> 00:34:59,599
Get comfortable.

475
00:35:08,608 --> 00:35:10,192
Pretty smart for a Nazi.

476
00:35:10,276 --> 00:35:12,153
I'm not a Nazi.

477
00:35:13,237 --> 00:35:15,656
How do you fall for this shit?

478
00:35:16,824 --> 00:35:19,702
Let's just say the people
who hurt me weren't white.

479
00:35:20,161 --> 00:35:21,662
Any of them women?

480
00:35:21,746 --> 00:35:23,956
It's a problem where I grew up.

481
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,040
Guys.

482
00:35:25,082 --> 00:35:27,102
What about tonight? Think we got a
white people problem?

483
00:35:27,126 --> 00:35:28,526
- Guys, shh.
- Fuck you.

484
00:35:48,522 --> 00:35:52,360
It looks like we tripped our main.
Our back-up gennie is fired up

485
00:35:52,443 --> 00:35:55,655
but we're gonna to have to call it
a day, do some troubleshooting.

486
00:35:55,738 --> 00:35:58,491
We'll try again on Sunday.
No door charge.

487
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,535
Hell, free drinks from two to four.

488
00:36:16,467 --> 00:36:20,304
Those of you attending the racial
advocacy workshop on Wednesday

489
00:36:20,388 --> 00:36:22,515
assume it's on
unless you hear otherwise.

490
00:36:23,808 --> 00:36:28,270
And remember,
this is a movement, not a party.

491
00:36:29,397 --> 00:36:31,774
Alright.
Stay safe! Godspeed.

492
00:36:34,819 --> 00:36:36,696
Who hasn't smoked yet?

493
00:36:38,781 --> 00:36:41,200
All right, you guys
are gonna come with me.

494
00:36:58,634 --> 00:37:00,177
You're not worried they'll talk?

495
00:37:01,804 --> 00:37:03,389
They got priorities.

496
00:37:07,685 --> 00:37:11,105
Tell them the party is on us
if they hole up for a couple of days.

497
00:37:11,188 --> 00:37:12,773
Put this fire out first.

498
00:37:13,524 --> 00:37:14,650
Grove Street?

499
00:37:14,734 --> 00:37:19,822
My dope, nigger stamps, in case one of these
meatheads gets booked for possession.

500
00:37:20,406 --> 00:37:24,452
All right. Let's get y'all somewhere safe!

501
00:37:37,298 --> 00:37:38,298
Treasure?

502
00:37:38,966 --> 00:37:40,801
Daylight. Underneath.

503
00:37:44,430 --> 00:37:45,806
They're moving our gear.

504
00:37:46,682 --> 00:37:48,517
- Yes?

505
00:37:48,601 --> 00:37:51,687
Gentleman. We're loading you out.

506
00:37:52,271 --> 00:37:53,355
Are the cops here?

507
00:37:53,814 --> 00:37:56,609
They've come and gone.
It got a little complicated.

508
00:37:57,485 --> 00:38:01,655
We are so fucked.
- Uh, I'm getting hoarse.

509
00:38:01,739 --> 00:38:05,659
Can you hear me
if I speak at this volume?

510
00:38:05,743 --> 00:38:06,743
- Yes.
- Yes.

511
00:38:06,786 --> 00:38:12,458
Good. Um, and can we please
elect just one voice?

512
00:38:16,462 --> 00:38:17,462
Yes.

513
00:38:17,505 --> 00:38:22,051
Okay, now, you're trapped.
That's not a threat. It's a fact.

514
00:38:22,134 --> 00:38:25,554
Well, we have a loaded gun.
That's also just a fact.

515
00:38:25,846 --> 00:38:28,599
Uh, we have plenty more guns on hand.

516
00:38:29,058 --> 00:38:32,478
We just want you out. Not harmed.

517
00:38:33,771 --> 00:38:38,067
Now the firearm you have
is not registered.

518
00:38:38,192 --> 00:38:42,154
I wanted it out of the picture
before the authorities arrived

519
00:38:42,238 --> 00:38:43,864
but you refused, so here we are.

520
00:38:43,948 --> 00:38:45,407
Bullshit.
- Yeah.

521
00:38:46,158 --> 00:38:47,409
Here we are.

522
00:38:48,327 --> 00:38:51,121
Oh, I do apologise for
my associates. They panicked.

523
00:38:51,205 --> 00:38:53,415
Yeah. No shit, man!
- Listen. Listen.

524
00:38:55,793 --> 00:38:57,962
No one is trying
to wipe the slate clean.

525
00:38:59,046 --> 00:39:03,133
Whatever you saw or did
is no longer my concern.

526
00:39:03,217 --> 00:39:05,511
You tell whoever you want
whatever you want.

527
00:39:05,594 --> 00:39:11,517
All I ask is that you understand
you were held here for your own safety

528
00:39:12,393 --> 00:39:13,894
before you were released.

529
00:39:18,107 --> 00:39:21,318
Okay. Yes, thank you.

530
00:39:23,112 --> 00:39:29,660
But just, uh, just to be clear,
the police are coming back?

531
00:39:29,743 --> 00:39:31,078
They've come and gone.

532
00:39:31,495 --> 00:39:34,206
Well, that's what concerns us, man!

533
00:39:34,290 --> 00:39:36,834
I just want that gun out of the picture.

534
00:39:42,673 --> 00:39:43,799
Okay.

535
00:39:45,134 --> 00:39:46,468
- Careful, man.
- Sorry.

536
00:39:47,303 --> 00:39:48,303
What do we do?

537
00:39:48,345 --> 00:39:49,665
We dig through the fucking floor.

538
00:39:50,014 --> 00:39:52,182
While they just wait?
They could shoot us at any time.

539
00:39:52,266 --> 00:39:54,369
Yeah, but they haven't.
How do we even know that they have guns?

540
00:39:54,393 --> 00:39:56,562
They have guns.
No question.

541
00:39:56,645 --> 00:39:58,939
We're gonna trust you?
- We've got zero leverage.

542
00:40:00,566 --> 00:40:02,735
Ask for a phone.
For the gun.

543
00:40:03,027 --> 00:40:04,236
Right.

544
00:40:04,361 --> 00:40:05,863
And what about him?

545
00:40:05,988 --> 00:40:07,382
Yeah, I mean the minute
we give it up, what if he just like...

546
00:40:07,406 --> 00:40:08,699
Then I'll wrap him up.

547
00:40:11,118 --> 00:40:13,412
Okay. Should we see what they think?
- Mm-hm.

548
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:22,796
All right. Uh, we'll give you
the gun for a cellphone.

549
00:40:23,797 --> 00:40:25,299
Sorry, no.

550
00:40:25,883 --> 00:40:28,010
Okay, well how about
a registered firearm?

551
00:40:28,093 --> 00:40:30,763
Funny. Justin, you alive and well?

552
00:40:31,555 --> 00:40:32,556
I'm alive.

553
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:38,646
Okay, good. Gentlemen,
I hope you appreciate the situation.

554
00:40:38,979 --> 00:40:41,941
Things have gone south, no doubt.

555
00:40:43,734 --> 00:40:49,114
But you know if you don't hand over
that gun, it won't end well.

556
00:40:50,199 --> 00:40:55,162
You see, for all I know,
I... I come to my place of business

557
00:40:55,537 --> 00:41:00,167
and there is an out of town band locked
in a room with an unregistered firearm.

558
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:02,250
Oh, come on!
- Somebody's hurt inside there.

559
00:41:02,836 --> 00:41:08,175
And I, I... and maybe there's a
hostage, too. So what do I do?

560
00:41:10,010 --> 00:41:13,055
Am I within my rights to intervene?

561
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:16,058
Should I kick down the
door and start shooting?

562
00:41:17,017 --> 00:41:22,439
Or, can we just remove the
guns from the equation.

563
00:41:23,691 --> 00:41:27,486
These are my questions.
You got 30 seconds to answer.

564
00:41:28,112 --> 00:41:30,030
Okay, hold on. Hold on.

565
00:41:31,407 --> 00:41:33,242
Great, anyone got any smart ideas?

566
00:41:34,284 --> 00:41:35,661
Justin, get on the floor.

567
00:41:38,122 --> 00:41:40,124
Get on the fuckin' floor right now. Go.

568
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:47,464
Right, Sam. Come round here.
Slowly, I want you to take the gun from me.

569
00:41:47,548 --> 00:41:49,348
- Okay.
- You got it? - Got it.

570
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:54,304
Okay, nice and easy.
You play nice and I'll be nice.

571
00:41:54,930 --> 00:41:56,932
Please, don't do anything.

572
00:41:57,057 --> 00:41:58,994
This is fucking retarded.
- No one's saying it isn't

573
00:41:59,018 --> 00:42:01,770
but we either hand over the gun
or we open fire with it.

574
00:42:01,895 --> 00:42:04,231
I vote for that.
- You don't have a vote! Okay?

575
00:42:05,232 --> 00:42:07,752
I mean we're taking chances either way, so...
- We are so fuckin' dead, guys.

576
00:42:07,776 --> 00:42:09,653
At least this way we find out.

577
00:42:09,778 --> 00:42:11,864
All we're doing now is buying time.

578
00:42:11,947 --> 00:42:12,948
For them.
- Amen.

579
00:42:13,407 --> 00:42:15,451
At this point, I'm just fucking curious.

580
00:42:19,705 --> 00:42:27,337
Okay. We'll give you the gun.
But we're gonna keep the ammo.

581
00:42:27,713 --> 00:42:30,549
Fine. Safer for everyone.

582
00:42:31,592 --> 00:42:33,552
All right, let's move this fucking couch.

583
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:49,610
All right. Keep still.

584
00:42:53,405 --> 00:42:55,532
Okay, stand back!
- You got it.

585
00:43:01,371 --> 00:43:02,498
Here we go.

586
00:43:11,381 --> 00:43:15,052
- May I approach?
- No! No, I'm gonna throw it.

587
00:43:16,261 --> 00:43:17,930
Careful. It was a gift.

588
00:43:25,604 --> 00:43:27,147
They're killing us.
- Keep the gun!

589
00:43:29,983 --> 00:43:30,983
Get the fuck off!

590
00:43:31,819 --> 00:43:34,196
- Okay, okay!

591
00:43:34,321 --> 00:43:38,200
Okay, okay!

592
00:43:48,710 --> 00:43:49,962
Oh my god!

593
00:43:50,838 --> 00:43:51,838
Put it up!

594
00:43:52,631 --> 00:43:53,924
Holy fuck.

595
00:43:55,717 --> 00:43:57,037
Yo, help me move the couch.

596
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:01,682
Help me move it.

597
00:44:02,182 --> 00:44:03,267
Oh, shit.

598
00:44:06,145 --> 00:44:09,231
- This'll be over soon, gentlemen.

599
00:44:16,530 --> 00:44:17,948
I'll fuckin' crush you.

600
00:44:21,827 --> 00:44:22,827
Whores!

601
00:44:28,041 --> 00:44:29,626
Get the box cutter!

602
00:44:31,795 --> 00:44:33,505
Get the fucking box cutter
out of his hand!

603
00:44:40,387 --> 00:44:42,181
Tell me when he's out.
- Okay!

604
00:44:43,223 --> 00:44:47,019
Pat! Pat! Look at me. Look at me.
Look at me. Shush! Shush!

605
00:44:50,272 --> 00:44:51,940
He's out. He's out!

606
00:44:55,402 --> 00:44:56,945
Oh. Oh, fuck.

607
00:44:58,155 --> 00:45:02,201
Put pressure on it! Put pressure!
- I know. I know. I know. Just breathe.

608
00:45:02,284 --> 00:45:03,952
Breathe.

609
00:45:05,162 --> 00:45:07,372
He's not out!
He's not out!

610
00:45:10,334 --> 00:45:11,668
You got this?

611
00:45:23,931 --> 00:45:27,351
- Shhh, shhh.

612
00:45:33,106 --> 00:45:35,776
How long does it take,
until you know?

613
00:45:36,944 --> 00:45:37,944
For sure?

614
00:45:41,865 --> 00:45:42,991
Holy fuck.

615
00:45:43,825 --> 00:45:44,825
Oh, Jesus.

616
00:45:49,498 --> 00:45:50,666
Oh, Jesus.

617
00:46:00,926 --> 00:46:04,846
Any and all firearms.
Clark will handle it from here on.

618
00:46:05,222 --> 00:46:06,723
He give you an ETA?

619
00:46:07,307 --> 00:46:08,517
You said no calls.

620
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:10,269
Right. Good. Phones...

621
00:46:10,394 --> 00:46:12,538
What happened in there?
- Set Neal up for tomorrow.

622
00:46:12,562 --> 00:46:15,274
New drywall, pour a floor.
Tell him we had a leak.

623
00:46:15,607 --> 00:46:17,526
Door with a frame, too.
- What happened?

624
00:46:18,193 --> 00:46:22,656
Uh, a bit of a maelstrom tonight.
Visiting band hurt one of ours.

625
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:25,575
- Who?
- Emily.

626
00:46:25,993 --> 00:46:27,327
Maybe Big Justin, too.

627
00:46:27,411 --> 00:46:29,997
What the fuck are we doing, then?
Let's get in there.

628
00:46:31,039 --> 00:46:34,835
We're not coming apart
is what we are doing.

629
00:46:35,252 --> 00:46:39,423
We're saving questions until this
pig fuck is transferred off site.

630
00:46:39,506 --> 00:46:40,507
Darcy.

631
00:46:42,592 --> 00:46:46,263
Okay. Last chance
if anyone needs to take a leak.

632
00:47:18,962 --> 00:47:20,547
I lost the gun.

633
00:47:21,131 --> 00:47:23,258
You held on longer than I would have.

634
00:47:29,306 --> 00:47:30,306
I'm going.

635
00:47:30,932 --> 00:47:36,521
There's no air shaft.
There's no sewer system. No nothing.

636
00:47:37,856 --> 00:47:39,232
There it is.

637
00:47:44,488 --> 00:47:46,865
- What time is it?
- It's not daylight.

638
00:47:46,990 --> 00:47:48,325
It's something.

639
00:47:48,992 --> 00:47:49,993
Out the way.

640
00:48:16,853 --> 00:48:17,853
Fuck.

641
00:48:20,899 --> 00:48:22,150
Now look for a door.

642
00:48:28,198 --> 00:48:29,449
Just let me know.

643
00:48:31,827 --> 00:48:37,666
Hey.
I'm sorry about your friend.

644
00:48:48,885 --> 00:48:50,929
Okay, move.
- Fuck.

645
00:49:04,359 --> 00:49:05,444
Is there a lock?

646
00:49:06,319 --> 00:49:07,863
Other side, maybe.

647
00:49:08,738 --> 00:49:09,990
We're burning time.

648
00:49:10,282 --> 00:49:13,285
Wait, but... well there's,
there's ventilation.

649
00:49:13,368 --> 00:49:15,120
Six inch ducts. Good luck.

650
00:49:15,203 --> 00:49:17,873
- Shouldn't we look around more?
- We just did!

651
00:49:18,248 --> 00:49:20,709
Go. Go, go, push.

652
00:49:28,175 --> 00:49:29,175
Heroin.

653
00:49:30,427 --> 00:49:33,972
It's not about her or us.

654
00:49:37,642 --> 00:49:39,495
It's a big-ass bunker.
- Give me your hand.

655
00:49:39,519 --> 00:49:40,913
- Big-ass dead end.
- Give it to me.

656
00:49:40,937 --> 00:49:42,439
Hold it up. Up there.

657
00:49:42,564 --> 00:49:44,917
All right, look away. Look away.
- Maybe we can use this to our advantage.

658
00:49:44,941 --> 00:49:45,984
We're done.

659
00:49:47,694 --> 00:49:52,240
I'm done. Okay, you can close the door
behind me if you want to strategise.

660
00:49:52,324 --> 00:49:55,035
We're not ready!
- What do you think they're doing out there?

661
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:58,455
That's just it. We don't know.
- We fucking know they mean us harm!

662
00:49:58,580 --> 00:50:01,791
It's just, if they have guns, okay,
why haven't they mowed us down already?

663
00:50:01,875 --> 00:50:05,712
We can't just go missing.
They need us found.

664
00:50:05,837 --> 00:50:08,673
Right. Grab some shit.
Get ready to run.

665
00:50:08,798 --> 00:50:09,925
Then we die.

666
00:50:10,008 --> 00:50:13,512
Yeah, but the longer we wait,
the surer that is.

667
00:50:15,180 --> 00:50:17,182
Tiger, You ready?
- Almost, man.

668
00:50:17,557 --> 00:50:20,727
We can't take it so seriously.

669
00:50:24,272 --> 00:50:30,111
We gotta treat this like paintball.

670
00:50:31,947 --> 00:50:33,073
What?

671
00:50:34,908 --> 00:50:36,409
Rick Silva.

672
00:50:38,912 --> 00:50:43,917
Helped organise the paint ball
for Skate-o's bachelor party.

673
00:50:44,459 --> 00:50:48,129
And we were short a few players
to book the whole field

674
00:50:48,213 --> 00:50:53,802
so they paired us up
with these ex-marines.

675
00:50:55,011 --> 00:51:00,058
And the first few rounds,
these guys just tore us to shreds.

676
00:51:01,351 --> 00:51:03,853
I mean zero casualties on their side.

677
00:51:04,437 --> 00:51:08,567
And I just cowered behind
these trees 'til I got shot.

678
00:51:09,651 --> 00:51:11,945
Covered in paint. But Rick...

679
00:51:12,028 --> 00:51:13,363
Tiger, you done?

680
00:51:15,782 --> 00:51:16,992
Okay.

681
00:51:17,117 --> 00:51:19,077
Pat, you're done, too.

682
00:51:19,202 --> 00:51:20,537
Sorry, man. We gotta go.

683
00:51:20,662 --> 00:51:23,290
That's okay.
- Was that a pep talk?

684
00:51:23,415 --> 00:51:24,415
Ready?

685
00:51:28,086 --> 00:51:33,758
Now we won't all live, but, uh,
I don't know, maybe we won't all die.

686
00:51:39,097 --> 00:51:41,808
Here.
- No, I'm just gonna run.

687
00:51:41,891 --> 00:51:42,934
I got it.

688
00:51:45,312 --> 00:51:48,231
All right, fuck it.
Simon and Garfunkel.

689
00:51:50,692 --> 00:51:52,193
Desert island band.

690
00:51:54,946 --> 00:51:56,364
Prince.

691
00:51:58,116 --> 00:51:59,326
I, uh...

692
00:52:01,703 --> 00:52:03,623
I'm still the Misfits.
- True school, man.

693
00:52:03,747 --> 00:52:05,123
Are we going?

694
00:52:07,250 --> 00:52:08,293
Yeah.

695
00:52:14,716 --> 00:52:19,137
Madonna and Slayer.

696
00:52:21,348 --> 00:52:22,557
Here we go.

697
00:52:23,725 --> 00:52:24,725
Watch it!

698
00:52:28,313 --> 00:52:29,356
What the fuck?!

699
00:52:30,982 --> 00:52:32,275
They loaded us out.

700
00:52:32,359 --> 00:52:33,586
How many exits are there?

701
00:52:33,610 --> 00:52:36,821
Uh, the main, the back,
maybe the kitchen. I always...

702
00:52:36,905 --> 00:52:37,905
What about windows?

703
00:52:37,947 --> 00:52:39,491
See for yourself.

704
00:52:40,950 --> 00:52:42,661
- What the fuck.
- Quiet.

705
00:52:45,914 --> 00:52:47,123
Oh, shit.

706
00:52:48,166 --> 00:52:49,376
Should we hide?

707
00:52:49,876 --> 00:52:51,378
Do whatever you want, man.

708
00:52:59,386 --> 00:53:00,887
We should split up.

709
00:53:01,179 --> 00:53:02,305
Totally.

710
00:53:12,232 --> 00:53:14,651
- Fuck. 
- Tiger!

711
00:53:17,987 --> 00:53:19,114
Tiger!

712
00:53:31,167 --> 00:53:32,210
Shit.

713
00:53:36,548 --> 00:53:37,548
Oh, shit.

714
00:53:41,761 --> 00:53:42,887
Save it.

715
00:53:43,430 --> 00:53:44,681
Oh, shit.

716
00:54:22,469 --> 00:54:23,970
<i>Fas! Fas!</i>

717
00:54:25,722 --> 00:54:29,100
<i>Voran! Fas! Fas!</i>

718
00:54:29,225 --> 00:54:30,143
Oh, fuck.

719
00:55:20,401 --> 00:55:21,528
Come on.

720
00:55:28,910 --> 00:55:31,996
They're everywhere!
Where's Reece?

721
00:55:35,041 --> 00:55:36,125
It's us.

722
00:55:42,423 --> 00:55:43,508
Come on, move.

723
00:55:46,594 --> 00:55:47,637
Sam, look.

724
00:55:51,766 --> 00:55:52,851
<i>Fleischwolf.</i>

725
00:55:53,226 --> 00:55:57,939
It's a song.
It means "meat grinder".

726
00:56:00,608 --> 00:56:04,362
Up! Up! <i>So ist brav. So ist brav.</i>

727
00:56:06,114 --> 00:56:08,324
You're retiring him?
- He's worked up.

728
00:56:09,576 --> 00:56:11,619
Send in another one.
Send two, finish it.

729
00:56:11,744 --> 00:56:13,580
Kill that feedback first.

730
00:56:14,205 --> 00:56:16,749
And if I send in two fight dogs,
what do you think they'll do?

731
00:56:17,166 --> 00:56:20,003
Send me in there. I'll finish up.
Just give me the rules.

732
00:56:20,837 --> 00:56:22,046
Alright.

733
00:56:24,549 --> 00:56:28,845
Blades only. Sloppy is fine.
Try not to hit the bone.

734
00:56:29,637 --> 00:56:30,637
Okay.

735
00:56:30,847 --> 00:56:31,973
Take Jonathan.

736
00:56:32,599 --> 00:56:35,268
- Brute squad.
- Keep him caged until we tag out.

737
00:56:39,689 --> 00:56:40,773
He breathing?

738
00:56:48,031 --> 00:56:49,324
A little bit, yeah.

739
00:56:49,616 --> 00:56:54,287
Let him bleed.
Later is better for time of death.

740
00:56:54,662 --> 00:56:55,788
Keys?

741
00:56:56,748 --> 00:56:57,749
No.

742
00:57:30,990 --> 00:57:32,241
They're coming.

743
00:57:34,577 --> 00:57:35,995
I can't do this.

744
00:57:42,418 --> 00:57:44,170
- Get back!
- No!

745
00:57:46,214 --> 00:57:47,214
Where's Emily?

746
00:57:54,180 --> 00:57:56,474
What the fuck are you doing?
Hey!

747
00:58:00,478 --> 00:58:02,647
Which one did it?
- Werm did it. - Bullshit.

748
00:58:03,356 --> 00:58:05,358
Which one?
- What did they tell you?

749
00:58:07,819 --> 00:58:10,989
What, you want to know?
You want him to know?

750
00:58:13,324 --> 00:58:16,411
Know what?
- Werm found out that she was leaving

751
00:58:18,162 --> 00:58:20,289
but she didn't say that it was with you.

752
00:58:22,667 --> 00:58:23,960
Meat grinder.

753
00:58:26,462 --> 00:58:28,297
That song was their cue.

754
00:58:30,591 --> 00:58:31,801
You should go.

755
00:58:41,978 --> 00:58:43,229
Get goin'.

756
00:58:44,522 --> 00:58:46,065
This is taking too long.

757
00:58:48,651 --> 00:58:49,694
Gabe?

758
00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:55,992
You didn't want Daniel on door duty.
Why?

759
00:58:57,910 --> 00:59:02,457
Nothing concrete.
He and... and Emily...

760
00:59:33,863 --> 00:59:35,531
Little lovebirds.

761
00:59:57,303 --> 00:59:58,429
Recognise this?

762
01:00:00,181 --> 01:00:01,265
No, sir.

763
01:00:01,349 --> 01:00:05,728
Of course not. You were still handing out
leaflets when these boys made their bones.

764
01:00:05,812 --> 01:00:07,480
It's from last Easter.

765
01:00:07,855 --> 01:00:11,067
Supposed to disappear after the boot party.

766
01:00:12,401 --> 01:00:15,613
He just started talking.
Amber's alive saying Werm did it.

767
01:00:15,696 --> 01:00:24,455
Never mind that.
You. Werm saved us all.

768
01:00:32,296 --> 01:00:33,548
Sam?

769
01:00:36,759 --> 01:00:38,052
It's okay.

770
01:00:38,970 --> 01:00:42,056
I mean, it's not okay.

771
01:00:42,723 --> 01:00:44,016
You didn't know either?

772
01:00:44,100 --> 01:00:45,810
- He's with us.
- Not where.

773
01:00:45,893 --> 01:00:46,893
We gotta split.

774
01:00:52,567 --> 01:00:54,527
This has a wider duct, I think.

775
01:00:55,862 --> 01:00:57,947
We're not gonna fit through there

776
01:00:59,949 --> 01:01:02,160
Daniel, uh, he can help.

777
01:01:03,119 --> 01:01:05,079
Why? Who's he?

778
01:01:05,163 --> 01:01:08,166
A traitor. If they don't
already know, they know now.

779
01:01:08,249 --> 01:01:09,750
I can get us out of here.

780
01:01:09,834 --> 01:01:12,170
Wow. A conspiracy.

781
01:01:12,295 --> 01:01:13,796
No, just a cluster-fuck.

782
01:01:20,970 --> 01:01:25,600
There is still blades and fangs for the visitors,
but we are getting lean on time.

783
01:01:25,683 --> 01:01:28,686
Now, if you have to shoot, shoot once.

784
01:01:28,769 --> 01:01:33,566
If more than once keep it a tight grouping
'cause you'll be digging the slugs out yourself.

785
01:01:33,691 --> 01:01:35,568
As for Daniel and Amber, they can...

786
01:01:40,615 --> 01:01:41,991
What did we forget?

787
01:01:52,501 --> 01:01:55,338
There's a river on two sides,
the quarry's on another.

788
01:01:55,421 --> 01:01:58,257
We can parallel the main road back,
go for help.

789
01:01:58,341 --> 01:02:00,384
Well, how will we get past the door?

790
01:02:00,468 --> 01:02:02,261
I know something you don't.

791
01:02:02,595 --> 01:02:03,763
Good, what?

792
01:02:03,846 --> 01:02:06,098
I know where we keep...

793
01:02:06,766 --> 01:02:08,643
- Too slow.

794
01:02:43,386 --> 01:02:46,347
Should we go? Now?

795
01:02:46,889 --> 01:02:49,350
We have the gun. I guess.

796
01:02:50,309 --> 01:02:52,979
Yes.
- Yes!

797
01:02:53,896 --> 01:02:56,232
Give me two.

798
01:03:18,087 --> 01:03:19,255
Easy! Not her!

799
01:03:20,756 --> 01:03:22,133
Don't fire!
- <i>Fas! Fas!</i>

800
01:03:24,802 --> 01:03:27,013
- No! 
- Sam!

801
01:03:28,347 --> 01:03:30,683
- Sam!

802
01:03:39,358 --> 01:03:41,152
We're never getting out.

803
01:03:46,782 --> 01:03:47,782
Fuck

804
01:04:10,222 --> 01:04:12,391
You know, I'm lucky.

805
01:04:13,142 --> 01:04:15,895
I guess at least
they were gonna shoot me.

806
01:04:26,739 --> 01:04:29,200
Three'll do, gentlemen.
The fourth can disappear.

807
01:04:29,325 --> 01:04:33,079
Time to start the clean-up.
I'm gonna need a push broom.

808
01:04:33,746 --> 01:04:36,123
This is supposed
to have happened already.

809
01:04:36,248 --> 01:04:38,376
Time to sprint.
- Yes, sir.

810
01:04:39,710 --> 01:04:41,504
Well done.

811
01:04:42,421 --> 01:04:44,090
Thank him.

812
01:04:45,800 --> 01:04:49,428
Nearly got away from me. Us.

813
01:04:55,267 --> 01:04:57,686
Shouldn't we be panicking?

814
01:05:01,649 --> 01:05:03,567
I'm hungry.

815
01:05:10,991 --> 01:05:13,744
I can't die here with you.

816
01:05:15,746 --> 01:05:17,957
So don't.

817
01:05:19,875 --> 01:05:22,878
You know, feel free just to...

818
01:05:27,216 --> 01:05:30,302
Hey, I want the rest
of your pep talk.

819
01:05:31,429 --> 01:05:34,014
Oh no. It no longer applies.

820
01:05:34,098 --> 01:05:38,227
Oh, come on. I'm curious.

821
01:05:39,770 --> 01:05:44,900
It was paintballing;
you were cowering.

822
01:05:48,195 --> 01:05:50,698
Yeah, Rick Silva.

823
01:05:52,199 --> 01:05:57,913
We were getting slaughtered
by these legit Iraq vets.

824
01:05:57,997 --> 01:06:00,040
It totally applies.

825
01:06:00,124 --> 01:06:05,129
Full camo, a thousand dollar
automatic paintball guns.

826
01:06:06,630 --> 01:06:11,802
They knew real war
and they played real war.

827
01:06:12,636 --> 01:06:20,895
Tactics, hand signals, flanking.
Just wiped us all out.

828
01:06:23,856 --> 01:06:27,985
So Rick gets fed up
and says fuck it.

829
01:06:28,903 --> 01:06:31,322
Didn't care about getting shot.

830
01:06:32,573 --> 01:06:35,117
Didn't take about taking cover.

831
01:06:35,451 --> 01:06:38,454
- It was hopeless, man.

832
01:06:40,873 --> 01:06:45,461
So, the last match,
the whistle blows

833
01:06:46,212 --> 01:06:52,092
and he just tears out there,
full jackass

834
01:06:52,676 --> 01:06:56,847
in... in sneakers and cut-offs

835
01:06:56,931 --> 01:07:01,310
and he wipes out
their whole team.

836
01:07:03,312 --> 01:07:05,356
Doesn't stop.

837
01:07:05,940 --> 01:07:12,029
Just keeps running
and laughing and shooting

838
01:07:14,323 --> 01:07:17,201
until they're all dead.

839
01:07:20,538 --> 01:07:22,790
Pretend dead.

840
01:07:23,916 --> 01:07:26,710
And we're up against real guns.

841
01:07:27,503 --> 01:07:28,879
Yeah.

842
01:07:30,756 --> 01:07:35,094
Either way, we can't play real war.

843
01:08:01,704 --> 01:08:03,789
Let's pretend.

844
01:08:20,514 --> 01:08:22,266
For you.

845
01:08:23,892 --> 01:08:28,397
We're just mopping up tonight.
You already earned these.

846
01:08:31,609 --> 01:08:34,653
Maybe push Neal,
depending on the mess.

847
01:08:34,737 --> 01:08:36,405
Start looking for
a new house band.

848
01:08:36,530 --> 01:08:39,283
We really gotta
get back to a routine.

849
01:08:39,366 --> 01:08:41,243
You think Cowcatcher's
gonna talk?

850
01:08:41,327 --> 01:08:43,996
I'm more worried
about their habits.

851
01:08:44,121 --> 01:08:47,916
Really have to stay away
from that nigger dope.

852
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,919
There's a bad batch
doing the rounds.

853
01:09:00,554 --> 01:09:02,056
Good to go.

854
01:09:04,808 --> 01:09:05,808
We're set.

855
01:09:05,893 --> 01:09:09,855
This all hinges on
nothing having happened here.

856
01:09:11,857 --> 01:09:13,984
Now, let's be clear...

857
01:09:16,570 --> 01:09:18,822
This should keep him
alive for another hour.

858
01:09:18,947 --> 01:09:22,993
I would consider it a personal favour
if he dies with meat in his teeth.

859
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:27,539
Come on. Come on.

860
01:09:30,626 --> 01:09:35,255
The bite command is <i>Fas.</i>
It's all you'll need.

861
01:09:42,429 --> 01:09:45,849
Disregard. Just shoot who is left.

862
01:09:45,933 --> 01:09:47,726
They don't have
to be accounted for.

863
01:09:47,810 --> 01:09:50,521
Forensics is no longer a concern.

864
01:09:51,814 --> 01:09:55,526
We call this in late,
all is for naught.

865
01:10:00,572 --> 01:10:02,825
You guys got any 12 gauge?
- Not in the office.

866
01:10:02,950 --> 01:10:05,035
Try the bar.
- How many shots you have left?

867
01:10:05,119 --> 01:10:07,287
- Three.
- So you have one extra.

868
01:10:22,261 --> 01:10:24,012
No shells.

869
01:10:26,807 --> 01:10:29,601
Behind the bar.
Better get started.

870
01:10:42,698 --> 01:10:44,199
- Shit!

871
01:10:44,283 --> 01:10:46,702
- Easy! Easy!

872
01:10:48,746 --> 01:10:50,247
Easy!

873
01:10:50,873 --> 01:10:52,458
No buckshot!

874
01:11:13,353 --> 01:11:14,914
- What's happening?

875
01:11:14,938 --> 01:11:17,024
Dog freaked. And turn this shit off!

876
01:11:17,149 --> 01:11:18,776
I tried! It's not coming
from our mixer.

877
01:11:18,859 --> 01:11:20,277
Go, we got this.

878
01:11:20,360 --> 01:11:23,322
And don't tell Darcy.
Or Clark.

879
01:11:26,533 --> 01:11:27,533
We going?

880
01:11:31,079 --> 01:11:31,789
Hey!

881
01:11:31,872 --> 01:11:34,333
Down there, dip-shit fashion punk
clown mother-fuckers!

882
01:11:34,416 --> 01:11:36,084
Turn around!
- Shazbot!

883
01:11:36,210 --> 01:11:38,545
What? What, who is that?

884
01:11:38,629 --> 01:11:40,172
Odin himself.

885
01:12:07,741 --> 01:12:10,285
Give me the shotgun.
- No, I got the shotgun.

886
01:12:10,369 --> 01:12:12,913
Then you go down
this fucking hole.

887
01:12:15,332 --> 01:12:17,626
Three shots?
- Yeah.

888
01:12:18,126 --> 01:12:20,420
You hear me fire twice,
you come down no matter what.

889
01:12:20,504 --> 01:12:21,964
This is a trap.
- Yeah, no shit.

890
01:12:22,089 --> 01:12:24,132
You wanna go tell Darcy?

891
01:12:29,388 --> 01:12:31,265
He's gonna be pissed.

892
01:12:34,810 --> 01:12:36,520
Watch my back.

893
01:13:02,045 --> 01:13:03,547
Fuck this.

894
01:13:05,549 --> 01:13:08,552
Get Gabe, man. We need two
down here and one up there.

895
01:13:08,635 --> 01:13:11,138
Who's got the nine?
- I think Alan does, but I'm not su...

896
01:13:11,221 --> 01:13:13,974
- Oh! Fuck! Block it!

897
01:13:15,767 --> 01:13:16,767
Pat!

898
01:13:17,895 --> 01:13:19,771
He's got three shots left!

899
01:13:19,897 --> 01:13:21,189
Bitch.

900
01:13:31,950 --> 01:13:33,285
Gabe!

901
01:13:41,418 --> 01:13:42,753
- Amber!
- Yeah?!

902
01:13:44,087 --> 01:13:48,133
Uh, never mind!

903
01:13:56,558 --> 01:13:58,852
Two shots left!

904
01:14:07,903 --> 01:14:09,738
Nice fuckin' try.

905
01:14:11,615 --> 01:14:13,659
Go fuck yourself!

906
01:14:46,566 --> 01:14:47,651
Oh shit!

907
01:14:50,028 --> 01:14:52,864
Pat! One shot left!

908
01:14:58,829 --> 01:15:00,122
Fuck.

909
01:15:08,296 --> 01:15:10,215
Zero.

910
01:15:17,014 --> 01:15:18,306
Oh, shit!

911
01:16:02,726 --> 01:16:04,019
Got him.

912
01:16:06,021 --> 01:16:07,898
Totally.

913
01:16:09,649 --> 01:16:12,486
Flabbergasted
that motherfucker.

914
01:16:32,714 --> 01:16:34,966
If I had any idea...

915
01:16:39,596 --> 01:16:41,681
Any more dogs?

916
01:16:43,767 --> 01:16:45,185
People?

917
01:16:45,310 --> 01:16:50,023
No. Not here.
They're up the road.

918
01:17:03,328 --> 01:17:05,539
I don't want to go to jail.

919
01:17:43,243 --> 01:17:46,204
Does anyone know
how to hotwire a car?

920
01:17:46,830 --> 01:17:48,165
No.

921
01:17:48,248 --> 01:17:50,709
I'd stay off the road anyway.

922
01:18:07,267 --> 01:18:09,436
Are you gonna shoot me?

923
01:18:09,978 --> 01:18:11,938
Where's Werm?

924
01:18:12,856 --> 01:18:16,109
We sent him home, but I wouldn't...
- Stay quiet 'til we're out.

925
01:18:39,466 --> 01:18:41,968
It's the residence.

926
01:18:43,386 --> 01:18:47,390
What are they doing?
- Something you don't want to see.

927
01:18:49,142 --> 01:18:51,937
We can call the cops
when we get to the orchard.

928
01:18:56,233 --> 01:18:58,944
Did you see them die?

929
01:19:00,278 --> 01:19:03,740
Two. Not the third.

930
01:19:07,994 --> 01:19:10,413
I think I'm going.

931
01:19:11,957 --> 01:19:14,000
Call the cops
when you get there.

932
01:19:14,125 --> 01:19:16,544
If you disappear, I'll find you.

933
01:19:16,628 --> 01:19:18,213
I will.

934
01:19:22,842 --> 01:19:24,052
I promise.

935
01:19:26,471 --> 01:19:31,476
You should go, too.
Just hedge our bets.

936
01:19:32,936 --> 01:19:38,358
You've got three rounds.
And I've seen you pump a shotgun.

937
01:19:39,276 --> 01:19:41,444
Fair enough.

938
01:19:56,501 --> 01:19:58,753
Do you believe him?

939
01:19:58,837 --> 01:20:00,588
Shh.

940
01:20:14,060 --> 01:20:16,062
- <i>Nimm futter...</i>

941
01:20:18,148 --> 01:20:20,025
<i>Nimm futter!</i>

942
01:20:26,114 --> 01:20:29,576
<i>Nimm futter! Nimm futter!
Nimm futter!</i>

943
01:20:30,535 --> 01:20:32,287
- Jesus.
- <i>Nimm futter!</i>

944
01:20:33,413 --> 01:20:35,749
That ought to be enough.

945
01:20:36,041 --> 01:20:38,335
<i>Lass es! Lass es! Lass es!</i>

946
01:20:38,460 --> 01:20:41,254
<i>- So ist brav.</i>

947
01:20:47,469 --> 01:20:50,555
- Wipe it down.

948
01:20:52,557 --> 01:20:54,035
You think they'd leave the engine on?

949
01:20:54,059 --> 01:20:56,936
Yeah. It'll run
the gauge down too.

950
01:20:57,020 --> 01:20:58,730
Call this in.

951
01:21:02,275 --> 01:21:03,401
<i>Aus, Aus.</i>

952
01:21:03,485 --> 01:21:04,611
You got the dog?

953
01:21:06,196 --> 01:21:08,531
I got the dog.

954
01:21:11,368 --> 01:21:12,952
Tie him up.

955
01:21:14,788 --> 01:21:16,831
Give me your gun.

956
01:21:16,915 --> 01:21:18,041
I don't have one.

957
01:21:18,124 --> 01:21:20,377
I'll shoot you either way
if you don't hand me one.

958
01:21:28,301 --> 01:21:29,761
Throw it.

959
01:22:46,463 --> 01:22:48,256
They're making it our fault.

960
01:22:50,508 --> 01:22:52,969
You were trespassing.

961
01:22:59,976 --> 01:23:02,353
It looks fishy to me.

962
01:23:02,479 --> 01:23:06,649
The cloth is to make it seal.
I wouldn't do it like that.

963
01:23:08,401 --> 01:23:09,777
They got my gun.
- Shut up.

964
01:23:09,861 --> 01:23:11,404
- Listen.

965
01:23:25,793 --> 01:23:30,006
So we're doing that?
- Why else would we walk up here?

966
01:23:32,926 --> 01:23:38,681
I don't know. And I was gonna
ruin the crime scene.

967
01:23:40,308 --> 01:23:44,229
Oh. I thought we'd
leave a new one.

968
01:23:59,827 --> 01:24:04,374
This is a nightmare.

969
01:24:06,417 --> 01:24:08,211
For us all.

970
01:24:09,212 --> 01:24:13,841
Tell me those stupid
fucking words are his last.

971
01:24:22,183 --> 01:24:23,601
Do you have a phone?

972
01:24:28,147 --> 01:24:33,236
It's funny. You were
so scary at night.

973
01:25:40,595 --> 01:25:42,430
We need the police.

974
01:27:16,107 --> 01:27:18,025
I know what it is.

975
01:27:21,988 --> 01:27:24,073

976
01:27:28,870 --> 01:27:31,581
