1
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:01,210
Fair is
foul, and foul is fair.

2
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:06,050
Hover through the
fog and filthy air.

3
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:13,640
When shall we
three meet again?

4
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:16,900
In thunder,
lightning, or in rain?

5
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:22,400
When the hurly-burly's done,
when the battle's lost and won.

6
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:24,900
That would be ere
the set of sun.

7
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:27,990
- Where the place?
- Upon the heath.

8
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:32,080
There to meet with Macbeth.

9
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,870
What bloody man is that?

10
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,420
Hail, brave friend!

11
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:07,630
Say to the king thy knowledge of
the broil as thou didst leave it.

12
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:10,380
Doubtful it stood.

13
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:14,300
The merciless Macdonwald led his
rebellion from the western isles.

14
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:18,140
And fortune on his
damned quarrel smiled.

15
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:21,680
- But brave Macbeth - -
Well he deserves that name!

16
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:24,390
Carved out a passage
till he faced the slave…

17
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,980
and ne'er shook hands,
nor bade farewell to him…

18
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:29,820
till he unseamed him
from the nave to the chops.

19
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,700
Valiant cousin.
Worthy gentleman!

20
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:37,070
Upon this chance
did the Norwegian king…

21
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:39,240
with furbished arms
and new supplies of men…

22
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:41,490
begin a fresh assault.

23
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:45,000
Dismayed not this, our
captains Macbeth and Banquo?

24
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:49,670
Yes, as sparrows eagles,
or the hare the lion.

25
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:53,760
So well thy words become thee
as thy wounds!

26
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,760
They smack of honor both.

27
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,510
Go get him surgeons.

28
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:11,900
- God save the king!
- What news, my worthy thane?

29
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:14,570
Norway himself,
with terrible numbers…

30
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:18,700
assisted by this most disloyal
traitor, the thane of Cawdor…

31
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:20,030
began a dismal conflict…

32
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:23,240
till Bellona's bridegroom,
bold Macbeth…

33
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:26,160
confronts the king,
rebellious arm 'gainst arm…

34
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:28,120
curbing his lavish spirit.

35
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:31,790
And to conclude,
the victory fell on us.

36
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:34,130
Great happiness!

37
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:37,590
No more that thane of Cawdor shall
deceive our bosom interest.

38
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,010
Go pronounce his
present death.

39
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:43,260
And with his former title…

40
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,350
greet Macbeth.

41
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:52,110

We are sent to give thee
from our royal master thanks…

94
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:35,990
only to herald thee into
his sight, not pay thee.

95
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:40,040
And for an earnest of a greater honor,
he bade me, from him, call thee…

96
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:42,160
thane of Cawdor.

97
00:13:44,210 --> 00:13:45,750
What?

98
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,920
Can the devil speak true?

99
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,920
The thane of Cawdor lives.

100
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:53,930
Why do you dress me
in borrowed robes?

101
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:56,010
Who was the thane lives yet.

102
00:13:56,090 --> 00:13:59,470
But under heavy judgment bears that
life which he deserves to lose.

103
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:03,100
Treasons capital, confessed and
proved, have overthrown him.

<i>Glamis…</i>

105

Thanks for your pains.

108
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:32,460
Do you not hope your children
shall be kings…

109
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:36,300
when those that gave the thane of
Cawdor to me promised no less to them?

110
00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:40,310
That trusted home…

111
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:43,180
might yet enkindle
you unto the crown…

112
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:46,350
besides the thane of Cawdor.

113
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:53,690
Oftentimes, to win us to our harm, the
instruments of darkness tell us truths…

114
00:14:54,530 --> 00:14:55,740
win us with honest trifles…

115
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:59,830
to betray us in
deepest consequence.

116
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:09,750
<i>This supernatural
soliciting cannot be ill…</i>

117
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,380
<i>cannot be good.</i>

118
00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:17,340
<i>If ill, why hath it given me
earnest of success…</i>

119
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:19,430
<i>commencing in a truth?</i>

120
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,850
I am thane of Cawdor.

121
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,020
<i>If good…</i>

122
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:32,980
<i>why do I yield to
that suggestion…</i>

123
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:35,690
<i>whose horrid image
doth unfix my hair…</i>

124
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:40,030
<i>and make my seated heart knock at
my ribs against the use of nature?</i>

125
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:46,200
<i>Present fears are less
than horrible imaginings.</i>

126
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:49,710
<i>My thought…</i>

127
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:52,460
<i>whose murder yet
is but fantastical…</i>

128
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:56,630
<i>shakes so my single
state of man…</i>

129
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,890
<i>that function is
smothered in surmise…</i>

130
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:03,510
<i>and nothing is

131
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:13,940

132
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:25,870

133
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:29,210
<i>If chance will have me king…</i>

134
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:31,710
<i>why, chance may crown me,
without my stir.</i>

135
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:34,250
Worthy Macbeth.

136
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,760

137
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:43,680
Give me your favor.

138
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:47,180
My dull brain was wrought
with things forgotten.

139
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:49,270
Let us to the king.

140
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:09,890
Long live the king.

141
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:24,240
Nothing in his life became
him like the leaving it.

142
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:27,280
He died as one that had been
studied in his death…

143
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:30,290
to throw away the dearest thing he
owed as 'twere a careless trifle.

144
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:33,710
There's no art to find the
mind's construction in the face.

145
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:37,540
He was a gentleman on whom
I built an absolute trust.

146
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:12,330
<i>"'Hail, king that shall be!'</i>

147
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:17,710
<i>This have I thought good
to deliver thee…</i>

148
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:21,340
<i>my dearest partner
of greatness…</i>

149
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:26,260
<i>that thou mightst not be ignorant
of what greatness is promised thee.</i>

150
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:31,760
<i>Lay it to thy heart,
and farewell."</i>

151
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:38,190
Glamis thou art, and Cawdor…

152
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:40,770
and shalt be what
thou art promised.

153
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:45,150
<i>Yet I do fear thy nature.</i>

154
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:50,120
<i>It is too full of the milk of human
kindness to catch the nearest way.</i>

155
00:19:52,410 --> 00:19:54,080
<i>Thou wouldst be great.</i>

156
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:59,080
<i>Art not without ambition, but without
the illness should attend it.</i>

157
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:04,170
<i>What thou wouldst highly,
that wouldst thou holily.</i>

158
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:06,800
<i>Wouldst not play false,
and yet wouldst wrongly win.</i>

159
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,720
<i>Hie thee hither…</i>

160
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:14,850
<i>that I may pour my
spirits in thine ear.</i>

161
00:20:14,930 --> 00:20:16,680
Hail, Macbeth!

162
00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:19,060
Hail, thane of Cawdor!

163
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:21,310
O worthiest cousin!

164
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:24,570
The sin of my ingratitude
even now was heavy on me.

165
00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:29,740
Only I have left to say, more is thy
due than more than all can pay.

166
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:35,120
The service and the loyalty I
owe, in doing it, pays itself.

167
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,410
Your Highness' part
is to receive our duties.

168
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:38,870
Welcome hither.

169
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:42,880
I have begun to plant thee and will
labor to make thee full of growing.

170
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:47,130
Noble Banquo,
that has no less deserved…

171
00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:51,090
let me enfold thee
and hold thee to my heart.

172
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:53,640
There if I grow,
the harvest is your own.

173
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,730
Sons, kinsmen, thanes…

174
00:21:03,810 --> 00:21:06,110
and you whose places
are the nearest…

175
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:08,780

00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,910
<i>Or art thou but a
dagger of the mind…</i>

352
00:39:58,990 --> 00:40:02,620
<i>a false creation proceeding
from a heat-oppressed brain?</i>

353
00:40:06,750 --> 00:40:08,500
<i>I see thee yet…</i>

354
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:12,750
<i>in form as palpable as this…</i>

355
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:14,840
<i>which now I draw.</i>

356
00:40:17,010 --> 00:40:20,220
<i>Thou marshall'st me
the way that I was going…</i>

357
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:24,850
<i>and such an instrument
I was to use.</i>

358
00:40:29,190 --> 00:40:32,190
Mine eyes are made the fools
of the other senses…

359
00:40:33,270 --> 00:40:35,280
or else worth all the rest.

360
00:40:37,030 --> 00:40:38,860
<i>I see thee still.</i>

361
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:42,370
<i>And on thy blade and dudgeon…</i>

362
00:40:42,450 --> 00:40:44,280
<i>gouts of blood…</i>

363
00:40:44,370 --> 00:40:46,370
<i>which was not so before.</i>

364
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:51,420
There's no such thing.

365
00:40:53,130 --> 00:40:56,670
It is the bloody business which
informs thus to mine eyes.

366
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:04,470
<i>Now, o'er the one-half world…</i>

367
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:06,640
<i>nature seems dead…</i>

368
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:11,230
<i>and withered murder…</i>

369
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:14,730
<i>alarmed by his
sentinel, the wolf…</i>

370
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:16,900
<i>whose howl's his watch.</i>

371
00:41:18,070 --> 00:41:20,780
<i>Thus with his stealthy pace…</i>

372
00:41:20,860 --> 00:41:23,070
<i>with Tarquin's
ravishing strides…</i>

373
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:26,620
<i>towards his design
moves like a ghost.</i>

374
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:34,170
<i>Thou sure and firm-set earth…</i>

375
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:37,750
<i>hear not my steps,
which way they walk…</i>

376
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:42,630
<i>for fear the very stones
prate of my whereabouts.</i>

377
00:41:49,350 --> 00:41:52,190
<i>Hear it not, Duncan…</i>

378
00:41:52,270 --> 00:41:55,310
<i>for it is a knell
that summons thee to heaven…</i>

379
00:41:56,610 --> 00:41:58,150
<i>or to hell.</i>

380
00:44:13,290 --> 00:44:14,790
Macbeth?

381
00:44:17,870 --> 00:44:18,920
Murde -

382
00:45:05,250 --> 00:45:08,220
<i>Hark, I am afraid they
have awaked and 'tis not done.</i>

383
00:45:08,300 --> 00:45:11,090
<i>The attempt and not the deed
confounds us.</i>

384
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:18,100
<i>Peace.</i>

385
00:45:19,310 --> 00:45:21,270
<i>It was the owl that shrieked…</i>

386
00:45:21,350 --> 00:45:24,440
<i>the fatal bellman which gives
the sternest good night.</i>

387
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:28,190
My husband?

388
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:55,800
I have done the deed.

389
00:45:58,970 --> 00:46:00,980
Didst thou not hear a noise?

390
00:46:03,020 --> 00:46:05,690
I heard the owl scream
and the crickets cry.

391
00:46:05,770 --> 00:46:07,110
Did not you speak?

392
00:46:07,190 --> 00:46:08,400
- When?
- Now.

393
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:09,610
- As I descended?
- Aye.

394
00:46:09,690 --> 00:46:11,280
Hark!

395
00:46:12,700 --> 00:46:15,530
- Who lies in the second chamber?
- Donalbain.

396
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,040
This is a sorry sight.

397
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:26,130
A foolish thought to
say a sorry sight.

398
00:46:27,540 --> 00:46:29,670
Me thought I
heard a voice cry…

399
00:46:29,750 --> 00:46:31,510
"Sleep no more.

400
00:46:32,670 --> 00:46:34,840
Macbeth does murder sleep."

401
00:46:37,220 --> 00:46:39,390
The innocent sleep…

402
00:46:39,470 --> 00:46:42,480
sleep that knits up
the ravelled sleave of care.

403
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:44,690
The death of each day's life…

404
00:46:44,770 --> 00:46:47,980
sore labor's bath,
balm of hurt minds.

405
00:46:48,060 --> 00:46:50,820
Great Nature's second course,
chief nourisher in life's feast.

406
00:46:50,900 --> 00:46:52,030
What do you mean?

407
00:46:52,110 --> 00:46:55,110
Still it cried
to all the house…

408
00:46:55,950 --> 00:46:58,280
"Glamis hath murdered sleep…

409
00:46:58,370 --> 00:47:01,830
and therefore Cawdor
shall sleep no more.

410
00:47:01,910 --> 00:47:03,750
Macbeth shall sleep no more."

411
00:47:03,830 --> 00:47:06,000
Who was it that thus cried?

412
00:47:07,830 --> 00:47:11,960
These deeds must not be
thought after these ways so.

413
00:47:12,050 --> 00:47:13,920
It will make us mad.

414
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:18,760
Come.

415
00:47:18,850 --> 00:47:22,100
Get some water and wash this
filthy witness from your hands.

416
00:47:25,730 --> 00:47:27,270
Come.

417
00:47:33,610 --> 00:47:36,820
Why did you bring these
daggers from the place?

418
00:47:40,450 --> 00:47:43,120
They must lie there.

419
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:45,460
I'll go no more.

420
00:47:45,540 --> 00:47:49,580
I'm afraid to think what I have
done. Look on it again I dare not.

421
00:47:49,670 --> 00:47:51,670
Infirm of purpose!

422
00:47:54,170 --> 00:47:55,970
Give me the daggers.

423
00:48:07,100 --> 00:48:08,850
If he do bleed…

424
00:48:10,310 --> 00:48:12,980
I'll gild the faces
of the grooms withal…

425
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:16,490
for it must seem their guilt.

426
00:48:45,020 --> 00:48:46,680
Whence is that knocking?

427
00:48:49,350 --> 00:48:52,520
How is it with me,
when every noise appalls me?

428
00:49:03,530 --> 00:49:05,290
What hands are here?

429
00:49:06,620 --> 00:49:08,540
They pluck out mine eyes.

430
00:49:09,910 --> 00:49:13,920
<i>Will great Neptune's ocean wash
this blood clean from my hand?</i>

431
00:49:14,710 --> 00:49:16,880
<i>No.</i>

432
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:22,470
<i>This my hand will rather the
multitudinous seas incarnadine…</i>

433
00:49:23,550 --> 00:49:25,890
<i>making the green one red.</i>

434
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:34,610
My hands are of your color.

435
00:49:38,780 --> 00:49:41,150
But I scorn to wear
a heart so white.

436
00:49:45,950 --> 00:49:48,410
A little water clears
us of this deed.

437
00:49:51,460 --> 00:49:53,920
How easy is it then.

438
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:04,760
Retire we to our chamber.

439
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:08,140
Get on your nightgown, lest occasion
call us and show us to be watchers.

440
00:50:10,310 --> 00:50:13,310
Be not lost so poorly
in your thoughts.

441
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:14,810
To know my deed…

442
00:50:14,900 --> 00:50:16,900
'twere best not know myself.

443
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:24,740
- Wake Duncan with thy knocking!
- Shh!

444
00:50:25,950 --> 00:50:27,330
I would thou couldst.

445
00:50:39,250 --> 00:50:42,220
Here's a knocking indeed!

446
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:47,260
If a man were porter of hell gate,
he'd have less turning the key.

447
00:50:47,350 --> 00:50:52,180
Who's there, in the
name of Beelzebub?

448
00:50:58,020 --> 00:51:00,780
Knock, knock!

449
00:51:00,860 --> 00:51:04,530
Who's there, in the
other devil's name?

450
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:09,200
Knock, knock. Never at quiet.

451
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:11,290
Well, what are you?

452
00:51:11,370 --> 00:51:16,040
One that goes the primrose way
to the everlasting bonfire?

453
00:51:19,790 --> 00:51:23,260
Oh, I'll devil-porter
it no further.

454
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:27,140
This place is too
cold for hell.

455
00:51:27,220 --> 00:51:30,140
Anon, anon!

456
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:38,440
Was it so late, friend, ere you
went to bed that you lie so late?

457
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:42,900
Faith, sir, we were carousing
till the second cock.

458
00:51:42,980 --> 00:51:44,860
And drink, sir…

459
00:51:44,940 --> 00:51:47,110
is a great provoker
of three things.

460
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:48,870
- What three things?
- Marry, sir.

461
00:51:48,950 --> 00:51:52,120
Nose-painting,
sleep and urine.

462
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:56,750
Lechery, sir,
it provokes and it unprovokes.

463
00:51:56,830 --> 00:51:59,630
It provokes the desire…

464
00:51:59,710 --> 00:52:02,050
but takes away
the performance.

465
00:52:02,130 --> 00:52:04,960
It makes you, it mars you.

466
00:52:05,050 --> 00:52:07,680
It sets you on
and takes you off.

467
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:10,430
It persuades you.

468
00:52:10,510 --> 00:52:12,010
It disheartens you.

469
00:52:12,100 --> 00:52:16,020
It makes you stand
to and not stand to.

470
00:52:16,100 --> 00:52:19,560
- I believe drink gave thee the lie last night.
- That it did, sir, in the very throat.

471
00:52:19,650 --> 00:52:22,110
- Is thy master stirring?
- Good morrow.

472
00:52:22,190 --> 00:52:23,900
- Good morrow!
- Good morrow, noble sir.

473
00:52:23,980 --> 00:52:26,360
Is the king stirring,
worthy thane?

474
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:29,820
- Not yet.
- He did command me to call timely on him.

475
00:52:29,910 --> 00:52:31,950
I have almost
slipped the hour.

476
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:36,080
I'll bring you to him.

477
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:02,480
This is the door.

478
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:05,570
I'll make so bold to call,
for 'tis my appointed service.

479
00:53:10,570 --> 00:53:12,780
Goes the king hence today?

480
00:53:12,870 --> 00:53:15,370
He does. He did appoint so.

481
00:53:15,450 --> 00:53:17,160
The night has been unruly.

482
00:53:17,250 --> 00:53:19,710
Where we lay,
our chimneys were blown down.

483
00:53:19,790 --> 00:53:23,130
And, as they say,
lamenting is heard in the air.

484
00:53:23,210 --> 00:53:25,880
Strange screams of death.

485
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:28,630
Some say the earth was
feverous and did shake.

486
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:31,300
- 'Twas a rough night.
- Oh, horror!

487
00:53:34,470 --> 00:53:36,470
Horror! Horror!

488
00:53:36,560 --> 00:53:39,390
- Confusion now has made his masterpiece.
- What's the matter?

489
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:41,640
Murder hath broke open
the Lord's anointed temple…

490
00:53:41,730 --> 00:53:43,690
and stole thence
the life of the building!

491
00:53:43,770 --> 00:53:45,400
The life? What is it you say?

492
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:47,570
Mean you His Majesty?

493
00:53:47,650 --> 00:53:49,360
Do not bid me speak.

494
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:51,820
See…

495
00:53:51,910 --> 00:53:53,660
and then speak yourselves.

496
00:53:56,030 --> 00:53:57,620
Awake!

497
00:53:58,330 --> 00:53:59,910
Awake!

498
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,920
Ring the alarm bell!

499
00:54:02,750 --> 00:54:05,080
Murder and treason!

500
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:07,550
Malcolm and Donalbain!

501
00:54:07,630 --> 00:54:10,170
Banquo! Awake!

502
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:14,140
Shake off this downy sleep,
death's counterfeit…

503
00:54:14,220 --> 00:54:16,470
and look on death itself!

504
00:54:16,550 --> 00:54:18,220
Up! Up!

505
00:54:18,310 --> 00:54:20,560
And see the great
doom's image!

506
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:22,690
Fleance! Banquo!

507
00:54:23,770 --> 00:54:25,730
Rise up as from your graves…

508
00:54:25,810 --> 00:54:29,530
and walk like spirits
to countenance this horror.

509
00:54:29,610 --> 00:54:31,530
Ring the bell!

510
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:26,870
What's the business,
that a hideous trumpet calls…

511
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:28,960
to parley the
sleepers of the house?

512
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:31,420
Speak! Speak!

513
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:35,340
Gentle lady, 'tis not for you
to hear what I can speak.

514
00:55:35,430 --> 00:55:38,260
O Banquo. Banquo.

515
00:55:38,340 --> 00:55:40,430
Our royal master's murdered.

516
00:55:40,510 --> 00:55:42,100
Woe, alas.

517
00:55:43,310 --> 00:55:46,890
What, in our house?

518
00:55:47,940 --> 00:55:49,520
Too cruel anywhere.

519
00:55:51,940 --> 00:55:55,650
Macduff, I prithee contradict
thyself and say it is not so.

520
00:55:55,740 --> 00:56:00,160
Had I but died before this chance,
I had lived a blessed time.

521
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:03,160
For from this instant there is
nothing serious in mortality.

522
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:06,580
All is but toys.
Renown and grace is dead.

523
00:56:06,660 --> 00:56:08,210
What is amiss?

524
00:56:08,290 --> 00:56:10,710
You are, and do not know it.

525
00:56:10,790 --> 00:56:12,880
Your royal father's murdered.

526
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:18,340
Who?

527
00:56:22,350 --> 00:56:23,640
By whom?

528
00:56:23,720 --> 00:56:26,390
Those of his chambers,
it seemed, had done it.

529
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:29,270
Their hands and faces
were all badged with blood.

530
00:56:29,350 --> 00:56:30,730
So were their daggers.

531
00:56:30,810 --> 00:56:34,320
O, yet I do repent me of my
fury that I did kill them.

532
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:50,670
Wherefore did you do so?

533
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:55,170
Who can be wise, amazed,
temperate and furious…

534
00:56:55,250 --> 00:56:57,050
loyal and neutral in a moment?

535
00:56:57,130 --> 00:56:58,670
No man!

536
00:56:58,760 --> 00:57:02,220
Here lay Duncan, his silver skin
laced with his golden blood.

537
00:57:02,300 --> 00:57:05,850
There the murderers, steeped
in the colors of their trade.

538
00:57:06,850 --> 00:57:10,480
Who could refrain,
that had a heart to love?

539
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:13,440
And, in that heart, courage
to make his love known?

540
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:17,440
What sight is this?

541
00:57:17,530 --> 00:57:19,780
Oh, God.

542
00:57:30,250 --> 00:57:31,960
Oh, my God.

543
00:57:50,390 --> 00:57:52,980
Let's briefly put
on manly readiness…

544
00:57:53,060 --> 00:57:55,150
and meet in the hall together…

545
00:57:55,230 --> 00:57:59,570
to question this most bloody piece
of work and know it further.

546
00:58:00,360 --> 00:58:02,860
Fears and scruples shake us.

547
00:58:02,950 --> 00:58:06,120
In the great hand
of God I stand…

548
00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:10,830
and thence against the undivulged
pretense I fight… of treasonous malice.

549
00:58:10,910 --> 00:58:12,620
- So do I.
- So all.

550
00:58:12,710 --> 00:58:14,290
So all.

551
00:58:18,550 --> 00:58:20,420
What will you do?

552
00:58:21,420 --> 00:58:23,430
Let's not consort with them.

553
00:58:24,680 --> 00:58:26,350
I'll to England.

554
00:58:27,100 --> 00:58:28,970
To Ireland, I.

555
00:58:29,060 --> 00:58:32,100
Our separated fortune
shall keep us both the safer.

556
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:36,110
Where we are, there's
daggers in men's smiles.

557
00:58:36,860 --> 00:58:39,030
This murderous
shaft that's shot…

558
00:58:39,110 --> 00:58:41,110
hath not yet lighted.

559
00:58:43,570 --> 00:58:45,620
Therefore to horse.

560
00:58:47,450 --> 00:58:50,660
And let us not be dainty
of leave-taking.

561
00:58:54,540 --> 00:58:56,170
Shift away.

562
00:59:34,330 --> 00:59:37,080
How goes the world, Macduff?

563
00:59:37,170 --> 00:59:39,590
Why? See you not?

564
00:59:39,670 --> 00:59:42,670
It's known who did
this more than bloody deed?

565
00:59:45,720 --> 00:59:48,390
Those that Macbeth hath slain.

566
00:59:48,470 --> 00:59:51,260
Alas, the day.
What good could they expect?

567
00:59:51,350 --> 00:59:53,020
They were suborned.

568
00:59:54,350 --> 00:59:57,730
Malcolm and Donalbain, the king's two
sons, have stolen away and fled…

569
00:59:57,810 --> 01:00:00,020
which puts upon them
suspicion of the deed.

570
01:00:01,730 --> 01:00:05,110
Then 'tis most like the sovereignty
will fall upon Macbeth.

571
01:00:05,190 --> 01:00:07,030
He's already named…

572
01:00:07,110 --> 01:00:09,450
and gone to Scone
to be invested.

573
01:00:09,530 --> 01:00:12,700
- Will you to Scone?
- No, cousin, I'll home to Fife.

574
01:00:13,700 --> 01:00:15,410
Well, I will thither.

575
01:00:16,500 --> 01:00:19,580
Oh. May you see things
well done there.

576
01:00:19,670 --> 01:00:21,210
Adieu.

577
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:48,610
<i>Thou hast it now.</i>

578
01:00:48,700 --> 01:00:52,120
<i>King, Cawdor, Glamis.</i>

579
01:00:52,990 --> 01:00:55,040
<i>All as the weird
women promised.</i>

580
01:00:57,580 --> 01:01:00,960
<i>And I fear thou play'dst
most foully for it.</i>

581
01:01:08,920 --> 01:01:12,050
<i>Yet it was said it should
not stand in thy posterity…</i>

582
01:01:13,100 --> 01:01:16,520
<i>but that myself should be the
root and father of many kings.</i>

583
01:01:18,020 --> 01:01:20,100
<i>If there comes
truth from them…</i>

584
01:01:21,350 --> 01:01:23,610
<i>may they not be my
oracles as well…</i>

585
01:01:24,770 --> 01:01:26,780
<i>and set me up in hope?</i>

586
01:01:31,910 --> 01:01:33,780
Hail, Macbeth!

587
01:01:33,870 --> 01:01:36,790
Hail, king of Scotland!

588
01:01:36,870 --> 01:01:38,950
Hail, Macbeth!

589
01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:41,960
Hail, king of Scotland!

590
01:02:00,850 --> 01:02:04,060
Here's our chief guest.

591
01:02:04,150 --> 01:02:06,900
If he had been forgotten, it'd have
been as a gap in our great feast.

592
01:02:13,820 --> 01:02:17,910
Tonight we hold a solemn supper,
sir, and I'll request your presence.

593
01:02:17,990 --> 01:02:20,580
Let Your Highness
command upon me…

594
01:02:20,660 --> 01:02:25,130
to the which my duties are with a
most indissoluble tie forever knit.

595
01:02:26,540 --> 01:02:28,000
Ride you this afternoon?

596
01:02:28,090 --> 01:02:29,710
Aye, my good lord.

597
01:02:29,800 --> 01:02:31,630
Is it far you ride?

598
01:02:31,720 --> 01:02:35,890
As far, my lord, as will fill up
the time twixt this and supper.

599
01:02:36,680 --> 01:02:39,350
- Fail not our feast.
- My lord, I will not.

600
01:02:44,150 --> 01:02:47,400
We hear our bloody cousins are
bestowed in England and in Ireland…

601
01:02:47,480 --> 01:02:50,400
not confessing their
cruel parricide.

602
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:54,530
But of that tomorrow. Hie you to
horse. Adieu till you return at night.

603
01:02:57,700 --> 01:03:00,490
- Goes Fleance with you?
- Aye, my good lord.

604
01:03:00,580 --> 01:03:03,460
I wish your horses
swift and sure of foot.

605
01:03:03,540 --> 01:03:05,120
Farewell.

606
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:17,430
- Attend those men our leisure?
- They do, my lord.

607
01:03:17,510 --> 01:03:19,220
Bring them before us.

608
01:03:21,020 --> 01:03:23,480
To be thus is nothing…

609
01:03:23,560 --> 01:03:26,150
but to be safely thus.

610
01:03:26,230 --> 01:03:28,980
Our fears in
Banquo stick deep.

611
01:03:29,060 --> 01:03:32,030
And in his royalty of nature
he hath the wisdom…

612
01:03:32,110 --> 01:03:34,450
that doth guide his
valor to act in safety.

613
01:03:35,860 --> 01:03:38,740
There is none but he
whose being I do fear.

614
01:03:38,820 --> 01:03:41,740
And under him my
genius is rebuked.

615
01:03:47,250 --> 01:03:49,670
We'll keep ourself
till suppertime alone.

616
01:03:49,750 --> 01:03:51,750
Till then, God be with you.

617
01:03:55,550 --> 01:03:57,070
<i>He chid the sisters…</i>

618
01:03:57,130 --> 01:04:00,350
<i>when first they put
the name of king upon me…</i>

619
01:04:00,430 --> 01:04:02,640
<i>and bade them speak to him.</i>

620
01:04:04,100 --> 01:04:07,690
<i>Then, prophet-like
they hailed him…</i>

621
01:04:07,770 --> 01:04:10,110
<i>father to a line of kings.</i>

622
01:04:11,150 --> 01:04:14,190
<i>Upon my head,
they placed a fruitless crown…</i>

623
01:04:14,280 --> 01:04:17,200
<i>and put a barren
scepter in my grip…</i>

624
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:19,990
<i>thence to be wrenched
with an unlineal hand…</i>

625
01:04:20,070 --> 01:04:22,200
<i>no son of mine succeeding.</i>

626
01:04:24,290 --> 01:04:25,790
<i>If it be so…</i>

627
01:04:26,620 --> 01:04:30,210
<i>for Banquo's sons
have I defiled my mind.</i>

628
01:04:30,290 --> 01:04:34,130
<i>For them the gracious Duncan
have I murdered.</i>

629
01:04:35,130 --> 01:04:37,010
To make them kings.

630
01:04:37,880 --> 01:04:39,640
The seeds of Banquo, kings.

631
01:04:53,820 --> 01:04:55,440
Stay within call.

632
01:04:57,530 --> 01:05:01,160
- Was it not yesterday we spoke together?
- It was, so please Your Highness.

633
01:05:07,790 --> 01:05:09,710
Well, then now…

634
01:05:09,790 --> 01:05:12,000
have you considered
of my speeches?

635
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:17,630
Know that it was he in the times past
which held you so under fortune…

636
01:05:17,720 --> 01:05:20,260
which you thought
had been our innocent self.

637
01:05:20,340 --> 01:05:22,340
You made this known to us.

638
01:05:24,180 --> 01:05:28,770
Do you find your patience so predominant
in your nature that you can let this go?

639
01:05:29,690 --> 01:05:32,350
Are you so gospelled to pray
for this good man…

640
01:05:32,440 --> 01:05:34,190
and for his issue…

641
01:05:34,270 --> 01:05:36,690
whose heavy hand
has bowed you to the grave…

642
01:05:36,780 --> 01:05:38,610
and beggared yours forever?

643
01:05:41,860 --> 01:05:44,200
We are men, my liege.

644
01:05:46,120 --> 01:05:49,410
Aye, in the catalog
ye go for men.

645
01:05:51,210 --> 01:05:53,580
As hounds and greyhounds…

646
01:05:53,670 --> 01:05:58,960
mongrels, spaniels, curs, shoughs,
water-rugs and demi-wolves are clept…

647
01:05:59,050 --> 01:06:01,050
all by the name of dogs.

648
01:06:02,050 --> 01:06:03,720
And so of men.

649
01:06:09,730 --> 01:06:14,150
Now, if you have a
station in the file…

650
01:06:14,230 --> 01:06:17,230
not in the worst
rank of manhood…

651
01:06:17,320 --> 01:06:18,900
say it…

652
01:06:19,900 --> 01:06:23,030
and I will put that business
in your bosoms…

653
01:06:24,280 --> 01:06:26,740
whose execution
takes your enemy off…

654
01:06:27,580 --> 01:06:30,620
grapples you to the
heart and love of us…

655
01:06:30,700 --> 01:06:34,330
who wear our health
but sickly in his life…

656
01:06:34,420 --> 01:06:37,670
which in his death
were perfect.

657
01:06:37,750 --> 01:06:39,000
I am one, my liege…

658
01:06:39,090 --> 01:06:42,130
whom the vile blows and buffets
of the world have so incensed…

659
01:06:42,220 --> 01:06:45,890
that I - I am reckless
what I do to spite the world.

660
01:06:46,930 --> 01:06:48,760
And I another.

661
01:06:48,850 --> 01:06:51,560
Both of you know
Banquo was your enemy.

662
01:06:51,640 --> 01:06:53,140
- Aye, my lord.
- Aye, my lord, but -

663
01:06:53,230 --> 01:06:54,850
So is he mine.

664
01:06:56,610 --> 01:07:00,440
And though I could with barefaced
power sweep him from my sight…

665
01:07:01,110 --> 01:07:03,360
and bid my will avouch it…

666
01:07:04,530 --> 01:07:07,030
yet I must not…

667
01:07:07,120 --> 01:07:10,700
for certain friends
that are both his and mine…

668
01:07:10,790 --> 01:07:12,790
whose loves I may not drop.

669
01:07:13,960 --> 01:07:15,540
And thence it is…

670
01:07:15,620 --> 01:07:18,790
that I to your assistance
do make love…

671
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:24,380
masking the business from the common
eye for sundry weighty reasons.

672
01:07:24,470 --> 01:07:26,430
We shall, my lord, perform
what you command us.

673
01:07:26,510 --> 01:07:29,640
- Though our lives may - - Your
spirits shine through you.

674
01:07:32,890 --> 01:07:34,810
It must be done tonight…

675
01:07:34,890 --> 01:07:37,060
and some way from the palace.

676
01:07:37,150 --> 01:07:40,820
And with him, to leave no
rubs nor botches in the work…

677
01:07:41,730 --> 01:07:45,490
Fleance, his son,
that keeps him company…

678
01:07:46,240 --> 01:07:50,490
whose absence is no less material
to me than is his father's…

679
01:07:51,410 --> 01:07:54,080
must embrace the fate
of that dark hour.

680
01:08:03,260 --> 01:08:06,130
- Resolve yourselves apart.
- We are resolved, my lord.

681
01:08:11,930 --> 01:08:14,100
Advise them where
to plant themselves.

682
01:09:49,110 --> 01:09:50,950
How now, my lord?

683
01:09:55,030 --> 01:09:57,120
Why do you keep alone…

684
01:09:58,330 --> 01:10:01,370
of sorriest fancies
your companions making?

685
01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:05,880
Things without all remedy
should be without regard.

686
01:10:05,960 --> 01:10:07,840
What's done is done.

687
01:10:10,840 --> 01:10:14,090
We have scotch'd the
snake, not killed it.

688
01:10:17,430 --> 01:10:19,890
But let the frame
of things disjoint…

689
01:10:19,980 --> 01:10:22,520
ere we will eat
our meal in fear…

690
01:10:22,600 --> 01:10:27,440
and sleep in the affliction of these
terrible dreams that shake us nightly.

691
01:10:29,860 --> 01:10:32,070
Better be with the dead…

692
01:10:32,150 --> 01:10:36,200
than on the torture of the mind
to lie in restless ecstasy.

693
01:10:39,490 --> 01:10:41,160
Duncan is in his grave.

694
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:46,170
After life's fitful fever,
he sleeps well.

695
01:10:47,170 --> 01:10:50,340
Treason has done his worst.

696
01:10:50,420 --> 01:10:54,090
Not steel, nor poison…

697
01:10:54,180 --> 01:10:56,890
malice domestic, foreign levy…

698
01:10:56,970 --> 01:10:58,890
nothing can touch him further.

699
01:10:58,970 --> 01:11:01,310
Come on. Gentle, my lord.

700
01:11:02,810 --> 01:11:05,190
Sleek o'er your rugged looks.

701
01:11:06,860 --> 01:11:10,030
Be bright and jovial
among your guests tonight.

702
01:11:12,740 --> 01:11:14,740
So shall I, love.

703
01:11:16,160 --> 01:11:18,160
And so, I pray, be you.

704
01:11:36,430 --> 01:11:40,010
Full of scorpions is my mind,
dear wife.

705
01:11:46,270 --> 01:11:49,270
Thou know'st that Banquo
and his Fleance live.

706
01:11:52,780 --> 01:11:55,610
But in them
nature's copy is not eterne.

707
01:11:58,030 --> 01:12:00,240
There's comfort yet.

708
01:12:00,330 --> 01:12:02,240
They are assailable.

709
01:12:05,580 --> 01:12:07,580
Then be thou jocund.

710
01:12:10,250 --> 01:12:13,630
Ere the bat hath flown
his cloistered flight.

711
01:12:13,710 --> 01:12:16,260
Ere to black Hecate's summons…

712
01:12:16,340 --> 01:12:19,390
the shard-borne beetle
with his drowsy hums…

713
01:12:19,470 --> 01:12:22,350
hath rung night's
yawning peal.

714
01:12:22,430 --> 01:12:26,690
There shall be done
a deed of dreadful note.

715
01:12:28,060 --> 01:12:30,060
What's to be done?

716
01:12:34,940 --> 01:12:37,400
Be innocent of the knowledge,
dearest chuck…

717
01:12:37,490 --> 01:12:39,610
till thou applaud the deed.

718
01:12:46,710 --> 01:12:49,750
Come, seeling night.

719
01:12:49,830 --> 01:12:54,090
Scarf up the tender
eye of pitiful day.

720
01:12:54,170 --> 01:12:57,220
And with thy bloody
and invisible hand…

721
01:12:57,300 --> 01:12:59,550
cancel and tear to pieces…

722
01:12:59,630 --> 01:13:02,640
that great bond
which keeps me pale.

723
01:13:05,970 --> 01:13:07,980
Light thickens…

724
01:13:08,060 --> 01:13:10,480
and the crow makes wing
to the rooky wood.

725
01:13:12,060 --> 01:13:15,480
Good things of day begin
to droop and drowse -

726
01:13:17,150 --> 01:13:20,410
while night's black agents
to their prey do rouse.

727
01:13:37,300 --> 01:13:39,260
Who did bid thee join with us?

728
01:13:39,340 --> 01:13:40,840
Macbeth.

729
01:13:42,090 --> 01:13:44,550
He needs not our mistrust…

730
01:13:44,640 --> 01:13:49,640
since he delivers our offices and what
we have to do to the direction just.

731
01:13:50,640 --> 01:13:52,730
Well, stand with us.

732
01:13:53,360 --> 01:13:56,150
The west yet glimmers
with some streaks of day.

733
01:13:56,230 --> 01:13:59,400
And near approaches
the subject of our watch.

734
01:14:07,450 --> 01:14:09,870
By the clock 'tis day…

735
01:14:09,960 --> 01:14:12,710
and yet dark night
strangles the traveling lamp.

736
01:14:14,210 --> 01:14:16,460
Is it night's predominance…

737
01:14:16,550 --> 01:14:18,630
or the day's shame…

738
01:14:18,710 --> 01:14:23,140
that darkness does the face of earth
entomb when living light should kiss it?

739
01:14:24,850 --> 01:14:27,310
It will be rain tonight.

740
01:14:28,810 --> 01:14:30,560
Let it come down!

741
01:14:34,560 --> 01:14:36,520
Treachery!

742
01:15:12,520 --> 01:15:14,810
Fly, good Fleance, fly!

743
01:15:18,190 --> 01:15:19,690
Fly!

744
01:15:26,870 --> 01:15:28,370
Fly!

745
01:16:20,880 --> 01:16:23,000
There's blood upon thy face.

746
01:16:26,680 --> 01:16:28,220
'Tis Banquo's then.

747
01:16:28,300 --> 01:16:31,510
- Is he dispatched?
- My Lord, his throat is cut.

748
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:33,310
That I did for him.

749
01:16:33,390 --> 01:16:35,640
Thou art the best
of the cutthroats.

750
01:16:35,730 --> 01:16:38,600
Yet he's good
that did the like for Fleance.

751
01:16:38,690 --> 01:16:41,650
If thou didst that,
thou art the nonpareil.

752
01:16:41,730 --> 01:16:44,530
Most royal sir,
Fleance is escaped.

753
01:16:46,900 --> 01:16:50,030
<i>Then comes my fit again.</i>

754
01:16:50,120 --> 01:16:52,160
<i>I had else been perfect…</i>

755
01:16:52,240 --> 01:16:54,870
<i>whole as the marble,
founded as the rock.</i>

756
01:16:54,950 --> 01:16:57,620
<i>But now I am cabined,
cribbed, confined…</i>

757
01:16:57,710 --> 01:17:00,630
<i>bound in to saucy
doubts and fears.</i>

758
01:17:00,710 --> 01:17:02,960
- But Banquo's safe?
- Aye, my good lord.

759
01:17:03,040 --> 01:17:06,970
Safe in that ditch he bides, with
20 trenched gashes on his head.

760
01:17:09,050 --> 01:17:12,390
There the grown serpent lies.

761
01:17:12,470 --> 01:17:14,310
The worm that's fled…

762
01:17:14,390 --> 01:17:17,430
hath nature that in time
will venom breed.

763
01:17:17,520 --> 01:17:20,060
No teeth for the present.

764
01:17:20,150 --> 01:17:21,650
Get thee gone.

765
01:17:21,730 --> 01:17:24,230
Tomorrow we'll hear
ourselves again.

766
01:18:33,890 --> 01:18:35,720
You know your own degrees.

767
01:18:35,800 --> 01:18:39,560
Sit down. At first and last,
a hearty welcome.

768
01:18:39,640 --> 01:18:41,730
Thanks to Your Majesty.

769
01:18:41,810 --> 01:18:44,150
Our hostess keeps her state.

770
01:18:44,230 --> 01:18:47,900
Ourself will mingle with society
and play the humble host.

771
01:18:49,690 --> 01:18:52,280
My royal lord,
you do not give the cheer.

772
01:18:52,360 --> 01:18:54,320
Sweet remembrancer.

773
01:19:01,200 --> 01:19:05,710
I drink to the general joy
of the whole table.

774
01:19:05,790 --> 01:19:09,840
And to our dear friend Banquo,
whom we miss.

775
01:19:09,920 --> 01:19:12,260
Would he were here.

776
01:19:12,340 --> 01:19:14,180
Banquo!

777
01:19:16,010 --> 01:19:20,310
Now good digestion wait on
appetite, and health on both.

778
01:19:20,390 --> 01:19:22,350
May it please Your
Highness, sit.

779
01:19:27,860 --> 01:19:30,730
Please it Your Highness to grace
us with your royal company?

780
01:19:33,240 --> 01:19:36,280
- The table's full.
- Here is a place reserved, sir.

781
01:19:38,030 --> 01:19:40,700
- Where?
- Here, my good lord.

782
01:20:10,770 --> 01:20:12,860
Wh-Which of you
have done this?

783
01:20:12,940 --> 01:20:16,610
- What, my good lord?
- Thou canst not say I did it.

784
01:20:17,570 --> 01:20:19,530
Never shake thy
gory locks at me.

785
01:20:19,620 --> 01:20:22,830
Gentlemen, rise.
His Highness is not well.

786
01:20:22,910 --> 01:20:24,660
Sit, worthy friends.

787
01:20:24,750 --> 01:20:27,370
My lord is often thus
and hath been from his youth.

788
01:20:27,460 --> 01:20:30,250
Pray, you keep seat.
The fit is momentary.

789
01:20:30,340 --> 01:20:32,590
Upon a thought, he
will again be well.

790
01:20:34,920 --> 01:20:36,420
Are you a man?

791
01:20:36,510 --> 01:20:40,600
Aye, and a bold one that dare look on
that which might appall the devil.

792
01:20:40,680 --> 01:20:42,720
O, proper stuff!

793
01:20:42,810 --> 01:20:45,310
This is the very
painting of your fear.

794
01:20:45,390 --> 01:20:48,190
This is the air-drawn dagger which
you said led you to Duncan.

795
01:20:48,270 --> 01:20:49,770
Shame itself!

796
01:20:52,230 --> 01:20:54,190
Why do you make such faces?

797
01:20:54,280 --> 01:20:56,900
When all's done,
you look but on a stool.

798
01:20:56,990 --> 01:20:59,780
Prithee, see there!
Behold, look!

799
01:20:59,860 --> 01:21:03,120
How say you! Avaunt and quit my
sight! Let the earth hide thee!

800
01:21:03,200 --> 01:21:06,000
Thy bones are marrowless,
thy blood is cold.

801
01:21:06,080 --> 01:21:10,040
Thou hast no speculation in those
eyes which thou dost glare with.

802
01:21:11,630 --> 01:21:13,210
What man dare, I dare.

803
01:21:13,290 --> 01:21:16,840
Take any shape but that, and my
firm nerves shall never tremble.

804
01:21:16,920 --> 01:21:18,930
Oh, hence, horrible shadow!

805
01:21:19,010 --> 01:21:20,510
Unreal mockery, hence!

806
01:21:26,020 --> 01:21:27,520
What?

807
01:21:28,390 --> 01:21:30,650
Quite unmanned in folly.

808
01:21:44,990 --> 01:21:46,910
If I stand here, I saw him.

809
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:48,750
Fie, for shame.

810
01:21:51,210 --> 01:21:54,750
Blood hath been shed ere now,
in the olden time.

811
01:21:54,840 --> 01:21:58,510
Aye, and since too, murders have been
performed too terrible for the ear.

812
01:21:59,800 --> 01:22:02,260
Time has been
that when the brains were out…

813
01:22:02,340 --> 01:22:05,430
the man would die,
and there an end.

814
01:22:05,510 --> 01:22:07,680
But now they rise again…

815
01:22:07,770 --> 01:22:10,100
with 20 mortal gashes
on their crowns…

816
01:22:10,180 --> 01:22:11,810
and push us from our stools.

817
01:22:11,890 --> 01:22:14,190
You've displaced the mirth,
broke the good meeting…

818
01:22:14,270 --> 01:22:16,650
with most admired disorder.

819
01:22:21,610 --> 01:22:23,490
Can such things be…

820
01:22:23,570 --> 01:22:27,290
and overwhelm us like a summer's
cloud without our special wonder?

821
01:22:28,870 --> 01:22:31,210
You make me strange…

822
01:22:31,290 --> 01:22:34,290
even to the
disposition that I owe.

823
01:22:34,380 --> 01:22:38,250
When now I think
you can behold such sights…

824
01:22:38,340 --> 01:22:41,380
and keep the natural ruby
of your cheeks…

825
01:22:43,430 --> 01:22:46,470
when mine is
blanched with fear.

826
01:22:46,550 --> 01:22:49,310
What sights, my lord?

827
01:22:52,730 --> 01:22:55,730
I pray you, speak not.
He grows worse and worse.

828
01:22:55,810 --> 01:22:58,650
Question enrages him.
At once, good night.

829
01:23:01,070 --> 01:23:04,070
Stand not upon the order of
your going, but go at once.

830
01:23:06,910 --> 01:23:10,410
Good night, and better
health attend His Majesty.

831
01:23:11,660 --> 01:23:13,670
Kind good night to all.

832
01:23:14,830 --> 01:23:19,500
It will have blood. They
say blood will have blood.

833
01:23:19,590 --> 01:23:22,800
Stones have been known to move
and trees to speak.

834
01:24:03,630 --> 01:24:05,630
What is the night?

835
01:24:07,430 --> 01:24:10,050
Almost at odds with morning…

836
01:24:10,140 --> 01:24:12,140
which is which.

837
01:24:29,320 --> 01:24:33,330
How say'st thou that Macduff denies
his person at our great bidding?

838
01:24:34,750 --> 01:24:36,750
How know you this, my lord?

839
01:24:37,750 --> 01:24:39,750
I hear it by the way.

840
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:45,050
There's not a one of them, but in
his house I keep a servant paid.

841
01:24:51,100 --> 01:24:54,020
You lack the season
of all natures, sleep.

842
01:24:56,350 --> 01:24:58,350
Come. We'll to sleep.

843
01:25:19,460 --> 01:25:21,750
I must again
to the weird sisters.

844
01:25:22,790 --> 01:25:24,920
More shall they speak.

845
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:29,180
For now I am bent to know,
by the worst means, the worst.

846
01:25:30,590 --> 01:25:33,760
For mine own good,
all causes shall give way.

847
01:25:37,390 --> 01:25:39,810
I'm in blood,
stepped in so far…

848
01:25:39,890 --> 01:25:44,900
that should I wade no more returning
were as tedious as go o'er.

849
01:25:48,780 --> 01:25:52,990
Strange things I have in head
that will to hand…

850
01:25:54,120 --> 01:25:57,370
which must be acted
ere they may be scanned.

851
01:26:00,580 --> 01:26:03,170
We are yet but young in deed.

852
01:27:39,060 --> 01:27:41,720
By the pricking of my thumbs…

853
01:27:41,810 --> 01:27:44,390
something wicked
this way comes.

854
01:27:47,900 --> 01:27:51,030
How now, you secret,
black and midnight hags?

855
01:27:51,110 --> 01:27:54,110
- What is it you do?
- A deed without a name.

856
01:27:54,200 --> 01:27:55,990
Double,
double, toil and trouble.

857
01:27:56,070 --> 01:27:58,160
Fire burn and cauldron bubble.

858
01:27:59,490 --> 01:28:03,700
Toad that under cold stone,
days and nights has 31.

859
01:28:03,790 --> 01:28:09,380
Swelted venom sleeping got, boil
thou first in the charmed pot.

860
01:28:09,460 --> 01:28:15,170
Eye of newt and toe of frog,
wool of bat and tongue of dog.

861
01:28:15,260 --> 01:28:18,180
Adder's fork and
blind-worm's sting…

862
01:28:18,260 --> 01:28:21,010
lizard's leg and
howlet's wing.

863
01:28:21,100 --> 01:28:23,640
Nose of Turk and
Tartar's lips…

864
01:28:23,720 --> 01:28:26,310
severed in the moon's eclipse.

865
01:28:26,390 --> 01:28:31,480
Fillet of a fenny snake,
in the cauldron boil and bake.

866
01:28:31,570 --> 01:28:37,150
Liver of blaspheming Jew,
gall of goat and slips of yew.

867
01:28:37,240 --> 01:28:41,240
I conjure you, by that which you
profess, howe'er you come to know it.

868
01:28:41,330 --> 01:28:43,620
Answer me to what I ask you.

869
01:28:43,700 --> 01:28:45,620
- Speak!
- Demand!

870
01:28:45,710 --> 01:28:47,000
We'll answer.

871
01:28:47,080 --> 01:28:51,170
Say if thou'dst hear it from our
mouths, or from our masters.

872
01:28:52,750 --> 01:28:55,550
Call them. Let me see them.

873
01:29:04,600 --> 01:29:07,480
Cool it with a baboon's blood…

874
01:29:07,560 --> 01:29:10,400
then the charm
is firm and good.

875
01:29:51,480 --> 01:29:53,150
Tell me, thou unknown power.

876
01:29:53,230 --> 01:29:54,770
He knows thy thought.

877
01:29:54,860 --> 01:29:58,940
Macbeth, Macbeth, Macbeth.

878
01:29:59,030 --> 01:30:03,240
Beware Macduff.
Beware the thane of Fife.

879
01:30:03,320 --> 01:30:06,990
Thou hast harped my fear
aright. But one word more!

880
01:30:07,080 --> 01:30:09,330
He will not be commanded.

881
01:30:23,180 --> 01:30:26,430
Be bloody, bold and resolute.

882
01:30:26,510 --> 01:30:29,270
Laugh to scorn
the power of man.

883
01:30:29,350 --> 01:30:32,350
For none of woman born
shall harm Macbeth.

884
01:30:32,440 --> 01:30:35,230
None of woman born
shall harm Macbeth.

885
01:30:35,310 --> 01:30:37,610
None of woman born -

886
01:30:37,690 --> 01:30:41,400
Then live Macduff.
What need I fear of thee?

887
01:30:41,490 --> 01:30:45,700
But I'll make assurance double
sure and take a bond of fate.

888
01:30:47,080 --> 01:30:48,580
Thou shalt not live!

889
01:31:03,380 --> 01:31:06,470
Macbeth shall never
vanquished be.

890
01:31:06,550 --> 01:31:08,220
Never, never.

891
01:31:08,310 --> 01:31:12,600
Until great Birnam
Wood to high Dunsinane Hill…

892
01:31:12,690 --> 01:31:14,310
shall come against him.

893
01:31:14,400 --> 01:31:17,400
Oh!

894
01:31:21,690 --> 01:31:24,280
That will never be!

895
01:31:24,360 --> 01:31:26,660
Who can recruit the forest?

896
01:31:26,740 --> 01:31:30,370
Bid the tree, unfix
his earth-bound root?

897
01:31:30,450 --> 01:31:32,750
Sweet bodements, good!

898
01:31:35,540 --> 01:31:37,710
Yet my heart throbs
to know one thing:

899
01:31:39,380 --> 01:31:42,170
Shall Banquo's issue
ever reign in this kingdom?

900
01:31:42,260 --> 01:31:44,090
Seek to know no more!

901
01:31:44,180 --> 01:31:49,260
I will be satisfied! Deny me this
and an eternal curse fall on you!

902
01:31:51,180 --> 01:31:53,560
Thou art too like
the spirit of Banquo.

903
01:31:53,640 --> 01:31:55,980
Thy crown does
sear mine eyeballs.

904
01:32:18,130 --> 01:32:21,300
What, will the line stretch
out to the crack of doom?

905
01:32:22,500 --> 01:32:24,510
Now I see 'tis true.

906
01:32:26,550 --> 01:32:30,350
For the blood-bolter'd Banquo
smiles upon me…

907
01:32:30,430 --> 01:32:32,720
and points at them for his!

908
01:32:57,670 --> 01:32:59,670
Where are they?

909
01:33:04,550 --> 01:33:07,220
Gone!

910
01:33:25,400 --> 01:33:28,450
Infected be the air
whereon they ride…

911
01:33:28,530 --> 01:33:31,570
and damned all those
that trust them!

912
01:33:55,600 --> 01:33:57,100
Macduff is fled.

913
01:34:00,560 --> 01:34:02,230
Can you tell
where he bestows himself?

914
01:34:02,310 --> 01:34:04,110
In the English court…

915
01:34:04,190 --> 01:34:06,320
where lives the son of Duncan.

916
01:34:06,400 --> 01:34:08,490
Thither Macduff is gone…

917
01:34:08,570 --> 01:34:10,950
to pray the holy
king upon his aid…

918
01:34:11,030 --> 01:34:14,330
to wake Northumberland
and warlike Seyward.

919
01:34:16,740 --> 01:34:20,910
By the help of these, we may
again give to our tables meat…

920
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:22,830
sleep to our nights…

921
01:34:22,920 --> 01:34:26,380
our feasts and banquets free
from bloody knives.

922
01:34:26,460 --> 01:34:29,050
Some holy angel
fly to the court of England…

923
01:34:29,130 --> 01:34:33,800
that a swift blessing may soon return
to this, our suffering country.

924
01:34:36,260 --> 01:34:38,270
Gentle lady.

925
01:34:41,270 --> 01:34:43,480
Gracious Duncan's dead.

926
01:34:51,150 --> 01:34:53,700
The gracious Duncan
was pitied of Macbeth.

927
01:34:53,780 --> 01:34:55,410
Marry, he was dead.

928
01:34:55,490 --> 01:34:58,120
The right valiant Banquo
walked too late.

929
01:34:58,200 --> 01:35:01,790
Whom, you may say, if it please you,
Fleance killed, for Fleance fled.

930
01:35:01,870 --> 01:35:04,580
Man must not walk too late.

931
01:35:04,670 --> 01:35:09,170
How monstrous it was for Malcolm and for
Donalbain to kill their gracious father.

932
01:35:09,250 --> 01:35:12,630
Damned, indeed.
How it did grieve Macbeth.

933
01:35:12,720 --> 01:35:16,300
I do think that had he
Duncan's sons under his key -

934
01:35:16,390 --> 01:35:18,220
As, an't please
heaven he shall not.

935
01:35:18,310 --> 01:35:20,470
They should find what it were
to kill a father.

936
01:35:20,560 --> 01:35:22,810
So should Fleance.

937
01:35:24,060 --> 01:35:25,770
Peace.

938
01:35:32,860 --> 01:35:34,360
What news?

939
01:35:39,990 --> 01:35:42,000
Macduff is fled to England.

940
01:35:43,660 --> 01:35:46,210
- Fled to England?
- Aye, my good lord.

941
01:35:48,090 --> 01:35:51,170
<i>Time, thou anticipatest
my dread exploits.</i>

942
01:36:17,780 --> 01:36:20,660
<i>The castle of
Macduff I will surprise.</i>

943
01:36:20,740 --> 01:36:22,830
<i>Seize upon Fife.</i>

944
01:36:22,910 --> 01:36:26,750
<i>Give to the edge of the sword
his wife, his babes…</i>

945
01:36:26,830 --> 01:36:30,790
<i>and all unfortunate souls
that trace him in his line.</i>

946
01:36:32,090 --> 01:36:33,590
<i>No boasting like a fool.</i>

947
01:36:34,630 --> 01:36:37,550
<i>This deed I'll do
before the purpose cool.</i>

948
01:36:51,060 --> 01:36:52,980
You must have patience, madam.

949
01:36:53,070 --> 01:36:55,190
He had none.
His flight is madness.

950
01:36:55,280 --> 01:36:57,450
When our actions do not,
our fears do make us traitors.

951
01:36:57,530 --> 01:36:59,570
You know not whether it was
his wisdom or his fear.

952
01:36:59,660 --> 01:37:01,830
Wisdom? To leave his wife,
to leave his babes…

953
01:37:01,910 --> 01:37:05,500
his mansion and his titles in a
place from whence himself does fly?

954
01:37:06,500 --> 01:37:08,710
He loves us not.

955
01:37:08,790 --> 01:37:10,630
He wants a natural touch.

956
01:37:10,710 --> 01:37:12,710
For the poor wren,
the most diminutive of birds…

957
01:37:12,790 --> 01:37:16,340
will fight, her young ones
in the nest, against the owl.

958
01:37:16,420 --> 01:37:18,630
All is the fear,
and nothing is the love.

959
01:37:18,720 --> 01:37:21,220
My dearest coz,
I pray you, school yourself.

960
01:37:22,970 --> 01:37:26,640
But for your husband,
he is noble, wise, judicious…

961
01:37:26,730 --> 01:37:29,190
and best knows the
fits of the seasons.

962
01:37:30,810 --> 01:37:32,400
I take my leave of you.

963
01:37:32,480 --> 01:37:35,440
I shall not be long
but I'll be here again.

964
01:37:35,530 --> 01:37:38,490
Things at their
worst will cease…

965
01:37:38,570 --> 01:37:41,240
or else climb upward
to what they were before.

966
01:37:43,200 --> 01:37:45,870
My pretty cousin.

967
01:37:47,040 --> 01:37:48,790
Blessing upon you.

968
01:37:48,870 --> 01:37:51,210
Fathered he is,
and yet he's fatherless.

969
01:37:52,210 --> 01:37:54,210
I take my leave at once.

970
01:38:43,640 --> 01:38:45,390
How wilt thou do for a father?

971
01:38:45,470 --> 01:38:47,640
Nay, how will you
do for a husband?

972
01:38:47,720 --> 01:38:50,520
Why, I can buy me
20 at any market!

973
01:38:55,520 --> 01:38:57,400
Was my father a traitor?

974
01:38:57,480 --> 01:38:59,990
Aye, that he was.

975
01:39:01,110 --> 01:39:02,610
What is a traitor?

976
01:39:02,700 --> 01:39:05,320
Why, one that swears and lies.

977
01:39:05,410 --> 01:39:07,780
Are they all
traitors that do so?

978
01:39:07,870 --> 01:39:10,620
Everyone that does so is a
traitor and must be hanged.

979
01:39:12,290 --> 01:39:14,540
- Who must hang them?
- Why, the honest men.

980
01:39:14,630 --> 01:39:16,670
Then the liars and
swearers are fools…

981
01:39:16,750 --> 01:39:18,960
for there are enough of them
to beat the honest men…

982
01:39:19,050 --> 01:39:20,510
and hang them up.

983
01:39:20,590 --> 01:39:22,970
Oh, God help
thee, poor monkey.

984
01:39:23,050 --> 01:39:25,010
If he were dead,
you would weep for him.

985
01:39:32,310 --> 01:39:35,480
Oh, God! No!

986
01:40:16,480 --> 01:40:18,360
Where's your husband?

987
01:40:18,440 --> 01:40:22,570
I hope, in no place so unsanctified,
where such as thou mayst find him.

988
01:40:25,070 --> 01:40:27,200
He's a traitor.

989
01:40:29,660 --> 01:40:31,660
Thou liest, thou
shag-haired villain!

990
01:40:31,740 --> 01:40:33,660
What, you egg?

991
01:40:36,830 --> 01:40:38,830
Young fry of treachery!

992
01:40:46,470 --> 01:40:48,470
He has killed me, Mother.

993
01:41:38,230 --> 01:41:43,060
Besides her walking
and other actual performances…

994
01:41:43,150 --> 01:41:45,150
what, at any time,
have you heard her say?

995
01:41:45,230 --> 01:41:47,860
That, sir, which I will
not report after her.

996
01:41:47,940 --> 01:41:50,030
You may to a doctor.

997
01:41:50,110 --> 01:41:52,030
'Tis most meet you should.

998
01:41:52,120 --> 01:41:54,240
Neither to you, nor anyone…

999
01:41:54,330 --> 01:41:57,040
having no witness
to confirm my speech.

1000
01:42:08,970 --> 01:42:12,140
- Her eyes are open.
- Aye, but their sense is shut.

1001
01:42:19,140 --> 01:42:20,640
What is it she does now?

1002
01:42:20,730 --> 01:42:24,610
It is an accustomed action with her
- to seem thus washing her hands.

1003
01:42:42,250 --> 01:42:44,170
Yet here's a spot.

1004
01:42:46,920 --> 01:42:48,920
Out, damned spot.

1005
01:42:50,010 --> 01:42:51,840
Out, I say.

1006
01:42:55,890 --> 01:42:57,390
One.

1007
01:42:59,020 --> 01:43:00,520
Two.

1008
01:43:02,600 --> 01:43:04,600
Why, then 'tis time to do it.

1009
01:43:08,570 --> 01:43:10,490
Hell is murky.

1010
01:43:11,610 --> 01:43:13,740
Fie, my lord, fie!

1011
01:43:13,820 --> 01:43:16,370
A soldier and afeard?

1012
01:43:16,450 --> 01:43:20,200
What need we fear who knows it, when
none can call our power to account?

1013
01:43:23,620 --> 01:43:27,170
Yet who'd have thought the old man
to have so much blood in him?

1014
01:43:28,250 --> 01:43:30,380
Well, well, well.

1015
01:43:30,460 --> 01:43:32,880
The thane of Fife had a wife.

1016
01:43:34,720 --> 01:43:36,640
Where is she now?

1017
01:43:39,060 --> 01:43:41,980
What, will these
hands ne'er be clean?

1018
01:43:44,350 --> 01:43:46,560
No more of that, my lord.
No more of that.

1019
01:43:46,650 --> 01:43:48,400
Your mar all with
this starting.

1020
01:43:48,480 --> 01:43:51,280
Go to. Go to. You have
known what you should not.

1021
01:43:51,360 --> 01:43:54,200
She has spoke what she should
not, I am sure of that.

1022
01:43:56,490 --> 01:43:58,830
Here's the smell
of blood still.

1023
01:44:03,330 --> 01:44:07,710
All the perfumes of Arabia will
not sweeten this little hand.

1024
01:44:11,920 --> 01:44:14,420
Oh!

1025
01:44:15,430 --> 01:44:17,430
What a sigh is there.

1026
01:44:17,510 --> 01:44:19,680
The heart is solely charged.

1027
01:44:20,760 --> 01:44:22,970
Wash your hands.

1028
01:44:23,060 --> 01:44:26,730
Put on your nightgown.
Look not so pale.

1029
01:44:27,850 --> 01:44:31,650
I tell you yet again, Banquo's buried.
He cannot come out of his grave.

1030
01:44:31,730 --> 01:44:33,230
Even so?

1031
01:44:35,530 --> 01:44:37,280
To bed.

1032
01:44:37,360 --> 01:44:39,070
To bed.

1033
01:44:39,160 --> 01:44:41,200
Come. Come, come.

1034
01:44:42,290 --> 01:44:44,290
Come, give me your hand.

1035
01:44:45,540 --> 01:44:47,920
What's done cannot be undone.

1036
01:44:49,420 --> 01:44:51,670
To bed, to bed.

1037
01:44:53,380 --> 01:44:55,300
To bed.

1038
01:44:55,380 --> 01:44:57,880
More needs she the divine
than the physician.

1039
01:44:59,050 --> 01:45:00,760
God.

1040
01:45:00,850 --> 01:45:02,850
God forgive us all.

1041
01:45:04,100 --> 01:45:05,600
Look after her.

1042
01:45:05,680 --> 01:45:07,520
Remove from her
the means of all annoyance…

1043
01:45:07,600 --> 01:45:09,600
and still keep eyes upon her.

1044
01:45:10,610 --> 01:45:13,070
- So good night.
- Good night, good doctor.

1045
01:45:30,580 --> 01:45:32,710
How does your patient, Doctor?

1046
01:45:32,790 --> 01:45:36,010
Not so sick, my lord,
as she's troubled…

1047
01:45:36,090 --> 01:45:39,220
with thick-coming fancies
that keep her from her sleep.

1048
01:45:39,300 --> 01:45:41,220
Cure her of that.

1049
01:45:46,520 --> 01:45:50,190
Canst thou not minister
to a mind diseased?

1050
01:45:50,270 --> 01:45:52,860
Pluck from the memory
a rooted sorrow?

1051
01:45:53,860 --> 01:45:56,530
Raze out the written troubles
of the brain?

1052
01:45:58,610 --> 01:46:03,580
And with some sweet,
oblivious antidote…

1053
01:46:03,660 --> 01:46:06,700
cleanse the charged bosom
of that perilous stuff…

1054
01:46:06,790 --> 01:46:09,710
which weighs upon the heart?

1055
01:46:09,790 --> 01:46:13,590
Therein the patient
must minister to himself.

1056
01:46:16,300 --> 01:46:19,920
Throw physic to the dogs.
I'll none of it.

1057
01:47:31,200 --> 01:47:34,790
Bring me no more reports.
Let them fly. All!

1058
01:47:35,920 --> 01:47:40,630
Till Birnam Wood remove to
Dunsinane, I cannot taint with fear.

1059
01:47:41,880 --> 01:47:44,340
What's the boy, Malcolm?

1060
01:47:44,430 --> 01:47:46,260
Was he not born of woman?

1061
01:48:04,820 --> 01:48:08,910
The spirits that know all mortal
consequence have pronounced me thus:

1062
01:48:08,990 --> 01:48:12,160
"Fear not, Macbeth.
No man that's born of woman…

1063
01:48:12,250 --> 01:48:14,750
shall e'er have
power upon thee."

1064
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:18,670
Then fly, false thanes…

1065
01:48:18,750 --> 01:48:21,960
and mingle with the
English epicures!

1066
01:48:54,700 --> 01:48:58,000
Our country
sinks beneath the yoke.

1067
01:48:58,080 --> 01:49:01,000
It weeps, it bleeds.

1068
01:49:01,090 --> 01:49:04,380
And each new day
a gash is added to her wounds.

1069
01:49:05,800 --> 01:49:09,340
Each new morn new widows howl,
new orphans cry.

1070
01:49:10,720 --> 01:49:15,310
New sorrows strike heaven on the face that
it resounds as if it felt with Scotland.

1071
01:49:23,860 --> 01:49:25,490
Who comes here?

1072
01:49:29,820 --> 01:49:32,830
A countryman
who seems a stranger to us.

1073
01:49:39,330 --> 01:49:41,790
My ever gentle cousin.

1074
01:49:44,670 --> 01:49:46,170
Welcome hither.

1075
01:49:54,510 --> 01:49:56,270
Stands Scotland where it did?

1076
01:49:56,350 --> 01:49:59,520
Alas, poor country.
Almost afraid to know itself.

1077
01:49:59,600 --> 01:50:02,400
It cannot be called our
mother, but our grave.

1078
01:50:04,270 --> 01:50:06,150
What's the newest grief?

1079
01:50:06,230 --> 01:50:08,650
Each minute teems a new one.

1080
01:50:08,740 --> 01:50:10,700
How does my wife?

1081
01:50:10,780 --> 01:50:12,120
Why, well.

1082
01:50:12,200 --> 01:50:13,950
- And all my children?
- Well too.

1083
01:50:14,030 --> 01:50:16,040
The tyrant has not battered
at their peace?

1084
01:50:16,120 --> 01:50:18,580
No. They were well at peace
when I did leave them.

1085
01:50:18,660 --> 01:50:20,710
Heave! Heave!

1086
01:50:20,790 --> 01:50:23,460
Be not a niggard of your
speech. How goes it?

1087
01:50:23,540 --> 01:50:25,460
Your eye in Scotland
will create soldiers…

1088
01:50:25,550 --> 01:50:27,880
make our women fight
to doff their dire distresses.

1089
01:50:27,960 --> 01:50:29,670
We are coming thither.

1090
01:50:34,390 --> 01:50:39,770
Gracious England hath lent us
good Seyward and 10,000 men.

1091
01:50:44,150 --> 01:50:46,070
Oh!

1092
01:50:51,070 --> 01:50:54,410
An older and a better soldier
none that Christendom gives out.

1093
01:50:55,740 --> 01:50:57,740
Oh!

1094
01:50:59,160 --> 01:51:01,660
♪

1095
01:51:05,170 --> 01:51:08,170
Would I could answer this
comfort with the like.

1096
01:51:08,250 --> 01:51:11,050
But I have words that will be
howled out in the desert air…

1097
01:51:11,130 --> 01:51:13,680
where hearing should
not catch them.

1098
01:51:13,760 --> 01:51:15,300
What concern they?

1099
01:51:15,390 --> 01:51:17,720
The main part
pertains to you alone.

1100
01:51:19,270 --> 01:51:21,730
If it be mine, keep
it not from me.

1101
01:51:21,810 --> 01:51:24,060
Quickly, let me have it.

1102
01:51:24,150 --> 01:51:28,520
Your castle is surprised, your wife
and babes savagely slaughtered.

1103
01:51:28,610 --> 01:51:30,110
Merciful heaven.

1104
01:51:39,620 --> 01:51:41,120
What, man!

1105
01:51:42,750 --> 01:51:45,290
Ne'er put your hat
upon your brows.

1106
01:51:50,300 --> 01:51:52,470
Give sorrow words.

1107
01:51:56,680 --> 01:51:58,260
My children too?

1108
01:51:58,350 --> 01:52:02,020
Wife, children, servants.
All that could be found.

1109
01:52:05,600 --> 01:52:07,480
And I must be from thence.

1110
01:52:07,560 --> 01:52:09,400
- My wife killed too?
- I have said.

1111
01:52:09,480 --> 01:52:10,900
Be comforted.

1112
01:52:10,980 --> 01:52:13,030
Let's make us medicines
of our great revenge…

1113
01:52:13,110 --> 01:52:15,110
to cure this deadly grief.

1114
01:52:16,660 --> 01:52:18,570
He has no children.

1115
01:52:21,370 --> 01:52:23,330
All my pretty ones!

1116
01:52:25,120 --> 01:52:27,250
Did you say all?

1117
01:52:27,330 --> 01:52:29,750
Hell-kite!

1118
01:52:29,840 --> 01:52:33,300
What, all my pretty chickens and
their dam at one fell swoop?

1119
01:52:33,380 --> 01:52:35,880
Dispute it like a man.

1120
01:52:35,970 --> 01:52:37,430
I shall do so.

1121
01:52:37,510 --> 01:52:39,800
But I must also
feel it as a man.

1122
01:52:41,060 --> 01:52:44,730
I cannot but remember
such things were…

1123
01:52:45,980 --> 01:52:48,150
that were most precious to me.

1124
01:52:50,020 --> 01:52:52,820
Did the heaven look on
and would not take their part?

1125
01:52:54,530 --> 01:52:57,240
Sinful Macduff,
they were all struck for thee.

1126
01:52:57,320 --> 01:53:01,370
Not for their own demerits, but for
mine, fell slaughter on their souls.

1127
01:53:03,450 --> 01:53:06,080
Heaven rest them now.

1128
01:53:06,160 --> 01:53:09,040
Be this the
whetstone of your sword.

1129
01:53:09,130 --> 01:53:12,000
Let grief convert to anger.

1130
01:53:12,090 --> 01:53:14,170
Blunt not the heart.

1131
01:53:14,260 --> 01:53:15,760
Enrage it!

1132
01:53:32,060 --> 01:53:34,730
Gentle heavens…

1133
01:53:34,820 --> 01:53:37,490
cut short all intermission.

1134
01:53:37,570 --> 01:53:41,660
Front to front bring thou this
fiend of Scotland and myself.

1135
01:53:41,740 --> 01:53:45,330
Our power is ready.
Macbeth is ripe for shaking.

1136
01:53:45,410 --> 01:53:48,330
Within my sword's
length set him.

1137
01:53:48,410 --> 01:53:52,420
If he escape,
heaven forgive him too.

1138
01:54:05,310 --> 01:54:06,810
What does the tyrant?

1139
01:54:06,890 --> 01:54:10,270
Great Dunsinane
he strongly fortifies.

1140
01:54:10,350 --> 01:54:11,940
Some say he's mad.

1141
01:54:12,020 --> 01:54:15,820
Others that lesser hate him
do call it valiant fury.

1142
01:54:15,900 --> 01:54:18,360
Those he commands
move only in command.

1143
01:54:18,440 --> 01:54:19,900
Nothing in love.

1144
01:54:19,990 --> 01:54:22,450
Now does he feel his title
hang loose about him…

1145
01:54:22,530 --> 01:54:25,160
like a giant's robe
upon a dwarfish thief.

1146
01:54:25,240 --> 01:54:28,040
All that is within him does
condemn itself for being there.

1147
01:54:28,120 --> 01:54:32,380
The English power is near, led on by Malcolm,
his Uncle Seyward and the good Macduff.

1148
01:54:32,460 --> 01:54:35,750
Near Birnam Wood
shall we well meet them.

1149
01:54:35,840 --> 01:54:37,510
That way are they coming.

1150
01:54:39,380 --> 01:54:41,700
The devil damn thee
black, thou cream-faced loon!

1151
01:54:41,760 --> 01:54:44,180
Where got'st thou
that goose look?

1152
01:54:44,260 --> 01:54:46,640
There is 10,000 s -

1153
01:54:46,720 --> 01:54:49,140
Geese, villain?

1154
01:54:49,230 --> 01:54:50,890
Soldiers, sir.

1155
01:54:50,980 --> 01:54:52,850
Thou lily-livered boy.

1156
01:54:52,940 --> 01:54:55,860
What s-s-soldiers, patch?

1157
01:54:55,940 --> 01:55:00,110
Death to thy soul. Those linen cheeks
of thine are counselors to fear.

1158
01:55:00,190 --> 01:55:03,070
What soldiers, whey-face?

1159
01:55:03,160 --> 01:55:06,830
The English force,
s-so please you.

1160
01:55:12,830 --> 01:55:16,290
Seyton!
Take thy face hence.

1161
01:55:20,090 --> 01:55:22,590
I am sick at heart,
when I behold -

1162
01:55:22,680 --> 01:55:24,510
Seyton, I say!

1163
01:55:25,720 --> 01:55:27,220
Seyton.

1164
01:55:29,560 --> 01:55:33,020
- Seyton! Sir! Seyton!
- Seyton!

1165
01:55:33,100 --> 01:55:34,770
<i>I have lived long enough.</i>

1166
01:55:34,850 --> 01:55:39,400
<i>My may of life is fallen into
the sear, the yellow leaf.</i>

1167
01:55:40,690 --> 01:55:43,360
<i>And that which should
accompany old age…</i>

1168
01:55:43,450 --> 01:55:48,620
<i>as honor, love, obedience…</i>

1169
01:55:48,700 --> 01:55:50,790
<i>troops of friends…</i>

1170
01:55:52,370 --> 01:55:54,710
<i>I must not look to have.</i>

1171
01:55:56,630 --> 01:56:00,960
<i>But in their stead, curses…</i>

1172
01:56:01,050 --> 01:56:04,050
<i>not loud, but deep.</i>

1173
01:56:05,720 --> 01:56:07,220
<i>Mouth-honor…</i>

1174
01:56:08,640 --> 01:56:12,890
<i>breath which the poor heart
would fain deny and dare not.</i>

1175
01:56:15,270 --> 01:56:17,100
Seyton!

1176
01:56:17,190 --> 01:56:20,520
- What's your gracious pleasure?
- What news more?

1177
01:56:20,610 --> 01:56:22,990
All is confirmed, my lord,
which was reported.

1178
01:56:23,990 --> 01:56:27,490
I'll fight till from my bones
my flesh be hacked.

1179
01:56:27,570 --> 01:56:29,990
- Give me my armor.
- 'Tis not needed yet.

1180
01:56:30,080 --> 01:56:31,910
I'll put it on.

1181
01:56:36,420 --> 01:56:39,420
Send out more horses,
skirr the country round.

1182
01:56:39,500 --> 01:56:41,500
Hang those that talk of fear.

1183
01:56:42,590 --> 01:56:44,970
Come, put mine armor on,
give me my sword.

1184
01:56:46,260 --> 01:56:49,720
Doctor, the thanes
fly from me.

1185
01:56:49,800 --> 01:56:52,100
Come, sir, dispatch.

1186
01:56:53,520 --> 01:56:55,560
If thou couldst, Doctor…

1187
01:56:55,640 --> 01:56:59,610
cast the water of my land,
find her disease…

1188
01:56:59,690 --> 01:57:03,110
and purge it to a sound
and pristine health…

1189
01:57:03,860 --> 01:57:07,150
I would applaud thee to the very
echo that should applaud again.

1190
01:57:08,160 --> 01:57:10,120
Pull it off, I say!

1191
01:57:11,200 --> 01:57:14,160
What rhubarb, senna…

1192
01:57:14,250 --> 01:57:18,370
or what purgative drug would
scour these English hence?

1193
01:57:18,460 --> 01:57:21,210
- Hear'st thou of them?
- Aye, my good lord.

Your royal preparation

Were I from Dunsinane
away and clear…

1198
01:57:45,780 --> 01:57:48,490
profit again
should hardly draw me here.

Our castle's strength
will laugh a siege to scorn.

1219

Here let them lie till famine
and the ague eat them up.

Were they not stuffed with
those that should be ours…

1221
02:00:43,120 --> 02:00:45,410
we might have met them
dareful, beard to beard…

1222
02:00:45,500 --> 02:00:47,210

1224
02:01:00,680 --> 02:01:03,520
I've almost forgot
the taste of fear.

The queen, my lord, is dead.

1231
02:01:52,560 --> 02:01:54,570
She should have
died hereafter.

1232
