177
00:10:40,007 --> 00:10:41,308
- No stopping.
- Child, please.

178
00:10:41,442 --> 00:10:42,343
- Let's do this. You ready?
- All right. Ready?

179
00:10:42,476 --> 00:10:43,677

- How was your run?
- It was good. It was good.

187
00:11:44,705 --> 00:11:45,940
I just went
to the park and back.

188
00:11:46,073 --> 00:11:48,008
Getting my win in.

189
00:11:48,142 --> 00:11:50,911
Okay, okay, my baby gonna ace
that conditioning test.

190
00:11:51,045 --> 00:11:52,913
- You know I will, come on.
- Okay, shoot.

191
00:11:53,047 --> 00:11:55,249
- Let's go.
- Since he found himself

192
00:11:55,382 --> 00:11:57,251
a new running partner.

193
00:12:02,423 --> 00:12:03,692
Baby, she was
already at the park

194
00:12:03,824 --> 00:12:06,727
- by the time I got there.
- Just messing with you.

195
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:08,663
I know my baby loves him
some chocolate.

196
00:12:08,796 --> 00:12:11,432
You know I do.
Don't you forget that.

197
00:12:11,566 --> 00:12:13,200
- Never.
- Mm-hm.

198
00:12:13,334 --> 00:12:15,769
Okay, I gotta go.

199
00:12:15,903 --> 00:12:17,572
- You all set?
- Yes, I love you.

200
00:12:17,706 --> 00:12:19,574
I love you, too.

201
00:12:19,708 --> 00:12:21,041
You do good
on your first day.

202
00:12:21,175 --> 00:12:22,409

Let me get this stuff.
Why don't you tell me

235
00:14:07,816 --> 00:14:09,684
all about it?
I need all the details.

236
00:14:09,818 --> 00:14:12,219
How was it?

237
00:14:12,353 --> 00:14:15,790
Well, everyone was super nice.

238
00:14:15,923 --> 00:14:18,392
I have a young
and hungry staff

239
00:14:18,526 --> 00:14:21,830
right out of college
who is willing to learn.

240
00:14:21,962 --> 00:14:23,531
- Good.
- They think they're ready

241
00:14:23,665 --> 00:14:25,734
- to take my job.
- Ahh. [laughing]

242
00:14:25,866 --> 00:14:27,901
Well, is that a good thing?

243
00:14:28,035 --> 00:14:29,671
Extremely.

244
00:14:31,472 --> 00:14:34,676
- This looks great.
- Yes, yes, yes, ooh.

245
00:14:38,045 --> 00:14:39,581
What you think?

246
00:14:40,715 --> 00:14:43,350
- Mm, mm-hm.
- This is delicious.

247
00:14:43,484 --> 00:14:45,319
I love it when you cook.

248
00:14:45,452 --> 00:14:47,020
You're so much better
at it than me.

249
00:14:47,154 --> 00:14:48,322
Thank you, baby.
That's sweet.

But you can cut out

cooking tomorrow.

Baby, I only use
my powers for good,

of you tomorrow

254

since I'll be gone
till Saturday.

00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,736
Wow, where are you going?

256
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:03,571
They're flying me
out to Atlanta

257
00:15:03,705 --> 00:15:05,874
to speak
to potential clients.

258
00:15:06,006 --> 00:15:07,709
So, I have to get
myself and the team

259
00:15:07,842 --> 00:15:09,443
up to speed tomorrow.

260
00:15:09,577 --> 00:15:10,944

Yeah, what's that?

264
00:15:17,685 --> 00:15:20,487
So I'll be taking
the agility test on Friday.

265
00:15:20,622 --> 00:15:21,623
And if I pass--

266
00:15:21,756 --> 00:15:23,290
- Mm-mm.

268
00:15:25,159 --> 00:15:28,061
When I pass, I'll have
the interview right after.

00:15:28,195 --> 00:15:29,864
- Babe, that's great.
- Right?

270
00:15:29,997 --> 00:15:32,032
- I'm a little nervous, but--
- You got this.

- Gimme some, gimme some.
- We got this.

I must have missed you
this morning.

No, I'm actually headed over
to take my agility test.

Okay, well, good luck.

00:16:13,541 --> 00:16:15,008

I won't keep you any longer.
Let me know how it goes, okay?

00:16:17,679 --> 00:16:19,146

Good morning, everyone.

I'm Sergeant Armstrong.

286
00:16:33,327 --> 00:16:36,129
I'll be conducting
your agility test.

287
00:16:36,263 --> 00:16:39,968
You'll be given 15 minutes
to run a mile and a half.

288
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:43,505
I'll be taking your times,
each lap you pass.

You'll call out
your last name

290
00:16:46,975 --> 00:16:48,843
each time you pass me.

291
00:16:48,977 --> 00:16:50,512
And if you don't
shout out your name,

292
00:16:50,645 --> 00:16:52,981
I won't record your progress.

293
00:16:53,113 --> 00:16:57,384
On your final lap,
I'll call out your time.

294
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:01,154
If you pass,
I'll see you inside.

295
00:17:01,288 --> 00:17:04,191
If not,
I'll see you next time.

What you doing?

00:17:28,716 --> 00:17:31,385
I can't breathe. I don't think
I'm gonna make the time.

302
00:17:31,519 --> 00:17:34,388
Well, look, I got news for you.
If you sprint this last 100,

303
00:17:34,522 --> 00:17:36,423
last 100, you make the time.

304
00:17:36,558 --> 00:17:38,058
But you got to go
right now, though.

00:17:38,191 --> 00:17:39,527

out there, Lawson.

316
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:17,899

anyone would have

317

helped that man out
in my position.

I'm talking about the nearly
14-minute mile and a half.

320
00:18:24,137 --> 00:18:25,873
that put in ten years
in the army

321
00:18:26,007 --> 00:18:28,076
would have performed
better than that.

your chops, Lawson.

I mean, the key is,
is that you passed.

Hell, I put in 20 years,

327
00:18:39,419 --> 00:18:41,656
and the very thought
of running hurts my feet.

328
00:18:41,789 --> 00:18:43,091

what you did

330
00:18:44,959 --> 00:18:47,327
We need more men
like you on the force.

331
00:18:47,461 --> 00:18:49,296
Well, sir,
we can't leave a man behind.

332
00:18:49,429 --> 00:18:51,799
Well, I'll be doing
a background check

333
00:18:51,933 --> 00:18:55,168
in the next couple of days
and checking your references,

334
00:18:55,302 --> 00:18:58,338
calling your past employers,
and talking to your neighbors.

335
00:18:58,472 --> 00:19:00,474
If everything checks out,
I'll let you know

336
00:19:00,608 --> 00:19:01,943
where we go from there.

00:19:02,076 --> 00:19:03,011

the opportunity.

- What's up, G, you aight?
- What's up, brother?

347
00:20:54,287 --> 00:20:55,288
- Come on in, man.
- Hey.

348
00:20:55,422 --> 00:20:57,091
Game just started.

349
00:20:59,894 --> 00:21:02,597
COMMENTATOR:
<i>Thirteen-point lead for Boston.</i>

350
00:21:03,731 --> 00:21:05,533
[commentator continues]

351
00:21:14,542 --> 00:21:16,177
<i>...and it's gonna be</i>
<i>Celtic ball.</i>

352
00:21:16,309 --> 00:21:18,311
<i>Great defensive play</i>
<i>from Kevin Garnett.</i>

353
00:21:18,445 --> 00:21:20,148
- One beer.
- There he is.

354
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,916
Hey...

355
00:21:22,049 --> 00:21:23,785
- You got a nice place.
- Thank you, man.

356
00:21:23,918 --> 00:21:25,753
- I appreciate it.
- Thank you for that invite.

357
00:21:25,887 --> 00:21:26,954
Oh, no problem, no problem.

358
00:21:27,088 --> 00:21:29,257
I didn't take you
for a hoops guy, though.

359
00:21:29,389 --> 00:21:31,659
- Really, I'm a football guy.
- But, you know,

360
00:21:31,793 --> 00:21:33,694
If LeBron playing,
I'm watching, no doubt.

361
00:21:33,828 --> 00:21:36,496
No doubt about that.
I'm watching, too.

362
00:21:36,631 --> 00:21:38,331
Hey, is Joy coming
to watch the game with us?

363
00:21:38,465 --> 00:21:40,701
Oh, no, no, man.
Joy's out of town on business.

364
00:21:40,835 --> 00:21:42,670
She'll be back in a couple days.

365
00:21:42,804 --> 00:21:44,005
That worked out perfect.

366
00:21:44,138 --> 00:21:45,405
Yeah.

367
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:47,608
Keisha out
getting her nails done.

368
00:21:48,943 --> 00:21:50,978
Hey, if you didn't call me...

369
00:21:51,112 --> 00:21:52,947
I'd probably be playing
spades or something

370
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:55,348
- with old man George.
- Hey, old man George be

371
00:21:55,482 --> 00:21:58,119
busting them spades, though.
I heard he was nice.

372
00:21:58,252 --> 00:21:59,921
- Man cold.
- Mm.

373
00:22:00,054 --> 00:22:03,224
Don't let the age fool you.
He sharp as a tack.

374
00:22:03,356 --> 00:22:05,226
Look, why don't you set
something up then?

375
00:22:05,358 --> 00:22:06,527
You know I love a challenge.

376
00:22:06,661 --> 00:22:08,830
Back home,
all we did is play spades

377
00:22:08,963 --> 00:22:10,731
and watch the game
on the weekends.

378
00:22:10,865 --> 00:22:12,533
- Really?
- Yeah, yeah.

379
00:22:12,667 --> 00:22:14,836
Hey, man, we should
start our own tradition.

380
00:22:15,937 --> 00:22:18,005
You can get your ass
whooped anytime you want.

381
00:22:18,139 --> 00:22:19,173
Whoa-whoa-whoa,
whoa-whoa-whoa...

382
00:22:19,307 --> 00:22:21,008
Who, me?

383
00:22:21,142 --> 00:22:23,644
- Yes.
- You sadly mistaken.

384
00:22:23,778 --> 00:22:25,546
But bet, set it up.

385
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,447
- Me? Mistaken.
- Yeah.

386
00:22:27,582 --> 00:22:29,449
- Very much so.
- I don't even eat meat.

387
00:22:29,584 --> 00:22:31,819
[doorbell ringing]

388
00:22:31,953 --> 00:22:33,420
Let me find out
if Keisha gave you permission

389
00:22:33,554 --> 00:22:37,525
- to be outside.
- What? I'm the man in my house.

390
00:22:37,658 --> 00:22:39,861
Plus, I let her know
where I was going before I left.

391
00:22:44,832 --> 00:22:47,668
- Hi.
- Hi.

392
00:22:47,802 --> 00:22:51,672
Oh, sorry to disrupt
you and Brandon.

393
00:22:51,806 --> 00:22:54,675
Oh, no, no.
Just watching the game.

394
00:22:54,809 --> 00:22:57,345
- Would you wanna join?
- Oh, no, thank you.

395
00:22:57,477 --> 00:22:59,479
I'm actually here for Joy.

396
00:22:59,614 --> 00:23:02,149
I came to ask her a question.
Is she home?

397
00:23:02,283 --> 00:23:04,218
Uh, no, she isn't in.

398
00:23:04,352 --> 00:23:05,786
Is it something
maybe I can help you with?

399
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:09,724
No, no, I don't want
to disturb you.

400
00:23:09,857 --> 00:23:11,592
Thank you for asking, though.

401
00:23:11,726 --> 00:23:14,595
No problem.
Hey, wait, uh...

402
00:23:16,297 --> 00:23:18,232
I passed the fitness exam.

403
00:23:18,366 --> 00:23:21,135
Congratulations.
I'm not surprised at all.

404
00:23:22,536 --> 00:23:24,038
I feel safer already.

405
00:23:24,171 --> 00:23:25,740
- Oh...
- [chuckling]

406
00:23:28,709 --> 00:23:29,944
I'll see you later.

407
00:23:30,077 --> 00:23:32,546
- See you later.
- Good night.

408
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,715
Good night.

409
00:23:44,759 --> 00:23:47,295
My bad, man, that was Becky
looking for Joy.

410
00:23:47,427 --> 00:23:49,230
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

411
00:23:49,363 --> 00:23:51,632
I could have swore
she was here looking for you.

412
00:23:51,766 --> 00:23:54,802
Oh, no, no, man,
I don't need those problems.

413
00:23:54,936 --> 00:23:56,637
- Mm.
- No, sir.

414
00:23:57,705 --> 00:23:59,240
She's very suspect.

415
00:23:59,373 --> 00:24:01,943
Hey, how long has she been
living in the neighborhood?

416
00:24:03,077 --> 00:24:06,013
She probably moved in, like,
right before you all moved in.

417
00:24:06,147 --> 00:24:07,715
Really?

418
00:24:07,848 --> 00:24:09,583
Oh, I thought
she'd been here for a while.

419
00:24:09,717 --> 00:24:12,954
Nah-- maybe, like,
a few months, if that.

420
00:24:13,087 --> 00:24:14,889
Oh, okay.

421
00:24:16,924 --> 00:24:18,458
Why you ask?

422
00:24:18,592 --> 00:24:20,428
Oh, no reason.
I'm just curious.

423
00:24:21,729 --> 00:24:22,830
Oh.

424
00:24:22,964 --> 00:24:24,565
You know,
she tried to get at me

425
00:24:24,699 --> 00:24:26,100
- once or twice.
- Really?

426
00:24:26,233 --> 00:24:28,602
Yeah, I played dumb
the entire time, though.

427
00:24:30,638 --> 00:24:32,440
[scoffs]

428
00:24:32,573 --> 00:24:34,375
Hey, I'm surprised
she didn't try to get at you.

429
00:24:34,508 --> 00:24:36,510
Well, wait-wait--
why you say that?

430
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:41,148
She seems to like
her coffee black,

431
00:24:41,282 --> 00:24:42,917
you know what I'm saying?

432
00:24:43,884 --> 00:24:47,955
Coffee black.
Yeah, that's crazy.

433
00:24:52,526 --> 00:24:54,161
Yeah, that's crazy.

434
00:25:02,003 --> 00:25:05,206
And how will
we target the audience?

435
00:25:05,339 --> 00:25:07,575
Please turn to the last page.

436
00:25:09,543 --> 00:25:12,913
So, this graph illustrates
first quarter projections

437
00:25:13,047 --> 00:25:16,017
if we focus on marketing
and advertising

438
00:25:16,150 --> 00:25:17,885
to the urban community
of Atlanta

439
00:25:18,019 --> 00:25:20,588
from ages 18 to 35

440
00:25:20,721 --> 00:25:23,858
using the major
social media platforms.

441
00:25:23,991 --> 00:25:27,628
I'm talking Facebook,
Instagram, and TikTok,

442
00:25:27,762 --> 00:25:30,698
as well as getting the major
influencers behind this.

443
00:25:30,831 --> 00:25:33,534
Now, by doing this,
I am certain

444
00:25:33,667 --> 00:25:36,003
that Film Life Clothing will
not only take over

445
00:25:36,137 --> 00:25:38,172
the Atlanta market,
but the other major

446
00:25:38,305 --> 00:25:39,407
surrounding cities.

447
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:41,675
I'm talking
Charlotte, Houston,

448
00:25:41,809 --> 00:25:43,911
New Orleans, and Miami.

449
00:25:44,045 --> 00:25:45,679
Well...

450
00:25:45,813 --> 00:25:48,849
thank you, Mrs. Lawson,
for that presentation.

451
00:25:48,983 --> 00:25:51,352
You've given us
a lot to think about, and...

452
00:25:51,485 --> 00:25:53,454
- Yes.
- ...we'll be in touch.

453
00:25:53,621 --> 00:25:55,890
Thank you, Mrs. Brown.
I know you're a busy lady.

454
00:25:56,023 --> 00:25:57,758
Of course.
Thanks for taking the time.

455
00:25:57,892 --> 00:26:00,127
And we have a meeting.

456
00:26:00,261 --> 00:26:02,396
- Okay, thank you.
- Take care.

457
00:26:02,531 --> 00:26:04,265
You too.

458
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:18,746
[engine rumbling]

459
00:26:21,982 --> 00:26:24,218
- Hello?
- Hey, babe.

460
00:26:24,351 --> 00:26:26,720
- How are you?
- Hey, baby. I'm good.

461
00:26:26,854 --> 00:26:29,558
I'm good. Just out here
cutting grass. How are you?

462
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:33,394
I'm good.
You behaving yourself?

463
00:26:35,564 --> 00:26:37,631
Of course,
of course, uh...

464
00:26:37,765 --> 00:26:39,900
But I did have a little
friend over last night, though.

465
00:26:40,034 --> 00:26:41,135
Who?

466
00:26:41,268 --> 00:26:42,970
Friendly neighbor.

467
00:26:43,104 --> 00:26:44,305
Boy, don't play with me.

468
00:26:44,438 --> 00:26:46,107
I know you didn't have
that Karen next door

469
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,242
- at our house.
- Girl, no.

470
00:26:48,375 --> 00:26:49,944
I had Brandon
from next door come over.

471
00:26:50,077 --> 00:26:51,245
We chilled
and watched the game.

472
00:26:51,378 --> 00:26:52,780
Don't mess with me like that.

473
00:26:52,913 --> 00:26:54,115
[laughing]

474
00:26:54,248 --> 00:26:55,649
Wait, and why she gotta
be a Karen, though,

475
00:26:55,783 --> 00:26:57,318
baby, like,
is my wife a racist?

476
00:26:57,451 --> 00:26:58,819
[scoffs]

477
00:26:58,953 --> 00:27:00,589
Black people can't be racist.

478
00:27:00,754 --> 00:27:02,890
It's a known fact
by default, no.

479
00:27:03,023 --> 00:27:05,259
You have nothing
to worry about, sweetie.

480
00:27:05,392 --> 00:27:07,194
I better not.

481
00:27:07,328 --> 00:27:08,563
How'd the meeting go?

482
00:27:09,897 --> 00:27:13,968
It went well. I think
we closed Film Life Clothing.

483
00:27:14,101 --> 00:27:16,303
Oh, that's good news.

484
00:27:16,437 --> 00:27:18,973
Thank you.
Well, I don't wanna

485
00:27:19,106 --> 00:27:20,741
take up too much more
of your time.

486
00:27:20,875 --> 00:27:22,743
I'll let you get back
to the yard work.

487
00:27:22,877 --> 00:27:25,112
Yeah-yeah, let me get
back to it, I miss you.

488
00:27:25,246 --> 00:27:27,047
I miss you, too.

489
00:27:27,181 --> 00:27:29,650
- I love you.
- I love you.

490
00:27:29,783 --> 00:27:32,219
- Love you more.
- Bye.

491
00:27:32,353 --> 00:27:33,721
Bye.

492
00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:38,092
[engine rumbling]

493
00:27:51,472 --> 00:27:53,374
[text chime]

494
00:27:58,112 --> 00:27:59,947
[laughing]

495
00:28:05,386 --> 00:28:06,854
[text chime]

496
00:28:10,858 --> 00:28:12,893
Yeah...
[whispering to self]

497
00:28:37,218 --> 00:28:39,153
GREG: [whispering]
Oh, man...

498
00:28:47,895 --> 00:28:49,863
Hey, what you smoking?

499
00:28:53,033 --> 00:28:55,436
They call it Spider.

500
00:28:55,570 --> 00:28:57,171
That smells good.

501
00:28:59,574 --> 00:29:02,577
Yeah... uh-oh.

502
00:29:02,711 --> 00:29:05,012
You gonna come over here
and arrest me or something?

503
00:29:06,213 --> 00:29:07,848
[chuckling]

504
00:29:07,982 --> 00:29:10,284
I'll let you off
with a warning if you share.

505
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:13,722
Deal.

506
00:29:24,999 --> 00:29:26,200
KEISHA: Uh...

507
00:29:28,002 --> 00:29:31,872
Ooh... I know he didn't.

508
00:29:32,006 --> 00:29:34,174
Girl, what are you doing?

509
00:29:34,308 --> 00:29:37,444
Over here watching
Greg and Becky smoke one.

510
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:42,349
Get away from the window.

511
00:29:42,483 --> 00:29:44,184
Over here looking
like you on a stakeout.

512
00:29:44,318 --> 00:29:46,621
Shh! Shh shh shh.

513
00:29:46,755 --> 00:29:49,123
They can't hear us
from the house, nosy.

514
00:29:51,058 --> 00:29:52,761
What's so funny?

515
00:29:55,630 --> 00:29:57,431
Do you date Black guys?

516
00:29:57,565 --> 00:29:59,433
I'm sorry.

517
00:29:59,567 --> 00:30:01,802
What, do I give off
that aura?

518
00:30:01,935 --> 00:30:03,837
No, no, you just...

519
00:30:03,971 --> 00:30:06,708

I don't know, babe,
I just, um... I mean,

697
00:40:55,756 --> 00:40:57,758
she probably doesn't even
season her food right.

698
00:40:57,892 --> 00:41:01,929
What's the deal?
Thought y'all was cool.

699
00:41:02,063 --> 00:41:03,931
Did something happen?

700
00:41:08,035 --> 00:41:09,637
No, no, nothing happened.

701
00:41:09,770 --> 00:41:11,639
Um... no,
I just want to spend

702
00:41:11,772 --> 00:41:13,207
all my time with you,
that's all.

703
00:41:14,241 --> 00:41:15,509
I get that.

704
00:41:15,643 --> 00:41:17,812
Let's just go,
get it out the way,

705
00:41:17,945 --> 00:41:20,414
and then come back
and be alone.

706
00:41:20,548 --> 00:41:22,717
- Okay?
- All right.

707
00:41:22,850 --> 00:41:24,285
Okay.

708
00:41:31,625 --> 00:41:33,094
[coughs]

709
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:49,443
Looks like you got
the good stuff.

710
00:41:49,577 --> 00:41:52,079
Girl, if you're calling
a $15 bottle of wine

711
00:41:52,213 --> 00:41:54,148
the good stuff,
then I'm guilty as charged.

712
00:41:54,281 --> 00:41:55,516
[laughter]

713
00:41:55,649 --> 00:41:57,218
Besides, we can't
stay over here too long.

714
00:41:57,351 --> 00:41:59,253
I got to get back
and take care of some things.

715
00:41:59,387 --> 00:42:00,955
I got some work I got to do.

716
00:42:01,088 --> 00:42:02,590
What you gotta do?

717
00:42:02,723 --> 00:42:04,392
You ain't got no job,
tell me!

718
00:42:04,525 --> 00:42:06,627
[mock-laughing]
Very funny.

719
00:42:06,761 --> 00:42:08,963
[door chimes]

720
00:42:09,096 --> 00:42:12,967
Hi, I'm so glad
you made it. Welcome.

721
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:15,036
Thank you for inviting us.

722
00:42:15,169 --> 00:42:16,470
We didn't get the memo.

723
00:42:16,604 --> 00:42:18,105
- Right?
- We underdressed.

724
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:20,741
No, no, not at all.

725
00:42:20,875 --> 00:42:22,843
Don't be silly.
You look perfect.

726
00:42:22,977 --> 00:42:24,745
Come on in.

727
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:28,249
[mouthing words]

728
00:42:34,121 --> 00:42:36,424
Well, I hope
you two are huggers,

729
00:42:36,557 --> 00:42:39,026
because you're
in the South now.

730
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:41,729
Come here.
Come here.

731
00:42:41,862 --> 00:42:43,664
- Mmm.
- Wow.

732
00:42:43,798 --> 00:42:46,033
[chuckling, sighing]

733
00:42:46,167 --> 00:42:49,170
You, too, Greg.
Come here.

734
00:42:52,807 --> 00:42:55,676
Hey-- yeah, look,
we bought some wine.

735
00:42:55,810 --> 00:42:57,611
- Oh, thank you.
- Yeah.

736
00:42:57,745 --> 00:43:01,449
- Ooh, the good stuff.
- Told you.

737
00:43:01,582 --> 00:43:03,117
Oh, yeah, well...

738
00:43:14,195 --> 00:43:15,429
Hm.

739
00:43:20,701 --> 00:43:24,004
I... I hope I didn't make
the food too spicy for you.

740
00:43:25,306 --> 00:43:27,341
No, actually...

741
00:43:27,475 --> 00:43:29,910
it's really good, I'm...

742
00:43:30,044 --> 00:43:33,582
- I'm pleasantly surprised.
- [laughing]

743
00:43:34,615 --> 00:43:35,950
Thank you.

744
00:43:36,951 --> 00:43:39,453
I guess I have Greg's approval.

745
00:43:39,588 --> 00:43:41,255
He hasn't said
a word all night.

746
00:43:42,389 --> 00:43:43,757
It's very good.

747
00:43:46,227 --> 00:43:47,461
- Becky.
- Hmm?

748
00:43:47,596 --> 00:43:49,096
These greens, though?

749
00:43:49,230 --> 00:43:50,764
Girl, they off the chain, like,

750
00:43:50,898 --> 00:43:52,666
who taught you
how to cook like this?

751
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:54,435
[clears throat]

752
00:43:54,569 --> 00:43:57,738
So, my first boyfriend
in high school

753
00:43:57,872 --> 00:43:59,807
was African-American,

754
00:43:59,940 --> 00:44:02,443
and his mom and I were
really close.

755
00:44:02,577 --> 00:44:04,845
She's from Louisiana, and...

756
00:44:04,979 --> 00:44:06,380
she doesn't cook
by measuring anything, right?

757
00:44:06,515 --> 00:44:08,583
It's all from, like,
feeling and love,

758
00:44:08,716 --> 00:44:10,552
- out of the heart.
- [laughter]

759
00:44:12,786 --> 00:44:14,655
Oh, would you like
some more wine?

760
00:44:14,788 --> 00:44:16,123
Absolutely.

761
00:44:21,596 --> 00:44:23,164
- Thank you.
- You're welcome. Greg?

762
00:44:23,297 --> 00:44:24,599
Mm-- I'm fine,
thank you.

763
00:44:24,732 --> 00:44:25,766
Okay.

764
00:44:26,967 --> 00:44:28,402
So, Becky,
are you from Houston?

765
00:44:28,537 --> 00:44:30,404
Born and raised.

766
00:44:30,539 --> 00:44:33,608
I love it here.
Aside from the heat.

767
00:44:33,741 --> 00:44:36,477
Oh, girl, look,
the heat is smothering.

768
00:44:36,611 --> 00:44:38,112
But... ooh...

769
00:44:38,245 --> 00:44:40,549
anyways, what do you do
for a living?

770
00:44:41,782 --> 00:44:43,717
Um...

771
00:44:43,851 --> 00:44:45,352
well...

772
00:44:46,353 --> 00:44:48,557
since my husband died, I...

773
00:44:49,723 --> 00:44:51,225
I'm sorry, I didn't know.

774
00:44:55,630 --> 00:44:58,332
It's kind of
still hard to talk about

775
00:44:58,465 --> 00:45:01,235
while... because
I'm still grieving him.

776
00:45:02,571 --> 00:45:06,207
He died unexpectedly
in a hiking accident.

777
00:45:07,975 --> 00:45:09,343
Um...

778
00:45:10,344 --> 00:45:12,346
He left me
a little bit of money.

779
00:45:12,479 --> 00:45:15,082
I'm just trying to start over.

780
00:45:16,183 --> 00:45:18,653
Live life,
whatever that means.

781
00:45:18,786 --> 00:45:20,254
You know? I'm sorry.

782
00:45:20,387 --> 00:45:22,557
No, I'm so sorry
I brought it up.

783
00:45:22,691 --> 00:45:23,891
I'm sorry.
No, no, it's fine.

784
00:45:24,024 --> 00:45:25,226
It's okay. I'm okay.

785
00:45:25,359 --> 00:45:28,229
- You sure?
- Yes... sure.

786
00:45:28,362 --> 00:45:29,463
[clears throat]

787
00:45:29,598 --> 00:45:30,864
Okay.

788
00:45:31,899 --> 00:45:33,267
[clears throat]

789
00:45:35,069 --> 00:45:36,837
Who wants dessert?

790
00:45:36,971 --> 00:45:39,073
I have sweet potato pie
in the fridge.

791
00:45:41,809 --> 00:45:44,044
Sweet potato pie,
or pumpkin pie?

792
00:45:44,178 --> 00:45:46,380
Because there's a difference.

793
00:45:46,514 --> 00:45:49,250
Girl, I know, okay?

794
00:45:49,383 --> 00:45:52,219
- [laughter]
- Believe me, I know.

795
00:45:52,353 --> 00:45:54,589
You know what, Becky, you...

796
00:45:55,923 --> 00:45:57,091
you all right with me.

797
00:45:57,224 --> 00:45:58,425
[mouthing "Well, thank you"]

798
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:00,194
[laughter]

799
00:46:00,327 --> 00:46:02,096
But I'm gonna have
to take a rain check

800
00:46:02,229 --> 00:46:03,698
- on your pie, okay?
- Okay.

801
00:46:03,831 --> 00:46:05,567
But this wine, though,

802
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:06,900
it is going through me.

803
00:46:07,034 --> 00:46:08,302
Please tell me
where your restroom is.

804
00:46:08,435 --> 00:46:10,404
Yeah, it's going to be
straight down the hall

805
00:46:10,538 --> 00:46:13,274
- to the left.
- Okay. Thank you.

806
00:46:14,275 --> 00:46:15,644
Excuse me.

807
00:46:32,727 --> 00:46:34,161
How was the food?

808
00:46:36,497 --> 00:46:39,668
It was good.
Thanks for the invite.

809
00:46:42,236 --> 00:46:43,505
Are you done
with your plate?

810
00:46:43,638 --> 00:46:45,172
Yeah.

811
00:46:54,181 --> 00:46:56,785
[sighing]

812
00:46:56,917 --> 00:46:58,620
You know...

813
00:46:58,753 --> 00:47:00,421
you've been kind of
quiet all night.

814
00:47:01,422 --> 00:47:02,791
Any reason why?

815
00:47:09,798 --> 00:47:11,398
Look, I thought we were
gonna keep our distance

816
00:47:11,533 --> 00:47:13,133
for a while after...

817
00:47:13,267 --> 00:47:14,569
you know.

818
00:47:14,703 --> 00:47:17,971
I promised you and Joy
I'd cook y'all dinner.

819
00:47:18,105 --> 00:47:20,007
I've got to keep my word.

820
00:47:21,909 --> 00:47:23,477
You're a widow?

821
00:47:24,445 --> 00:47:26,013
I didn't know that.

822
00:47:27,448 --> 00:47:30,417
Well, it could have
been pillow talk

823
00:47:30,552 --> 00:47:33,053
after our quickie,
but you decided

824
00:47:33,187 --> 00:47:35,022
to grow a conscience.
[laughing]

825
00:47:36,223 --> 00:47:38,025
Oh, don't worry.

826
00:47:38,158 --> 00:47:41,028
It'll be our little secret.
[clicks tongue]

827
00:47:42,630 --> 00:47:44,965
Look, I'm sorry
if I misled you

828
00:47:45,099 --> 00:47:49,036
in any way,
but I love my wife.

829
00:47:50,871 --> 00:47:54,241
Oh, so you want to forget
that you were all up in me?

830
00:47:54,375 --> 00:47:57,444
What? I never touched you.

831
00:47:57,579 --> 00:48:00,314
That's not
how I remember it.

832
00:48:00,447 --> 00:48:02,015
In my mind,

833
00:48:02,149 --> 00:48:06,387
you did all kinds of freaky shit
to me in that pool.

834
00:48:07,454 --> 00:48:09,123
You're crazy.

835
00:48:09,256 --> 00:48:12,359
Becky, thank you
so much for dinner.

836
00:48:12,493 --> 00:48:14,629
Of course.
It's my pleasure.

837
00:48:14,763 --> 00:48:15,896
I washed my hands.

838
00:48:16,029 --> 00:48:17,632
- I promise.
- Oh, I trust you.

839
00:48:17,766 --> 00:48:19,199
Okay, so do you need us
to help you with

840
00:48:19,333 --> 00:48:21,468
- any of these dishes?
- No, I got it.

841
00:48:21,603 --> 00:48:23,437
Are you sure?
Because Greg doesn't mind.

842
00:48:23,571 --> 00:48:25,774
- Do you, Greg?
- [chuckling]

843
00:48:27,074 --> 00:48:29,544
You know what?
We gotta go.

844
00:48:29,677 --> 00:48:31,546
Thank you so much
for the lovely meal, Becky.

845
00:48:31,679 --> 00:48:33,046
- Yes.
- Of course.

846
00:48:33,180 --> 00:48:34,549
Let me walk you
out the door.

847
00:48:36,383 --> 00:48:39,453
Now, Becky, I need
the recipe to those greens.

848
00:48:42,891 --> 00:48:45,058
Enjoy the rest of your night.

849
00:48:45,192 --> 00:48:46,561
You, too.

850
00:49:00,775 --> 00:49:02,409
[chuckling]

851
00:49:04,211 --> 00:49:05,979
[sighing]

852
00:49:07,414 --> 00:49:10,217
[sighing, chuckling]

853
00:49:13,788 --> 00:49:17,357
[sighing, moaning]

854
00:49:26,099 --> 00:49:27,936
I cannot believe
Becky can throw down

855
00:49:28,068 --> 00:49:29,704
in the kitchen like that.

856
00:49:29,838 --> 00:49:31,305
Oh, it was all right.

857
00:49:31,438 --> 00:49:33,675
I mean, I guess
I shouldn't be too surprised.

858
00:49:33,808 --> 00:49:36,109
She's dated enough brothers.

859
00:49:36,243 --> 00:49:37,812
Oh, so you know her type?

860
00:49:37,946 --> 00:49:39,112
Yeah.

861
00:49:39,246 --> 00:49:40,715
Girl talk, sweetheart.

862
00:49:40,849 --> 00:49:42,349
Girl talk.

863
00:49:42,483 --> 00:49:44,819
So before you left, you didn't
want to talk to the woman.

864
00:49:44,953 --> 00:49:47,020
Now, y'all besties,
all 'cause she done

865
00:49:47,154 --> 00:49:49,624
hit your taste bud spot?
That what you're telling me?

866
00:49:52,426 --> 00:49:55,496
Now, you know
no one hits my spot like you.

867
00:49:55,630 --> 00:49:57,966
Ooh, I know
that's right, mm!

868
00:49:59,099 --> 00:50:01,970
Mm, right... on top...
like that.

869
00:50:02,102 --> 00:50:03,838
Mm!

870
00:50:05,673 --> 00:50:07,174
Put those legs...
right there.

871
00:50:20,487 --> 00:50:23,257
Oh, baby.
This smells delicious.

872
00:50:23,390 --> 00:50:26,026
Mm, after I'm done
with this, you next.

873
00:50:29,363 --> 00:50:30,565
Deal.

874
00:50:30,698 --> 00:50:32,834
Becky, what the hell are
you doing in my house?

875
00:50:32,967 --> 00:50:34,903
What's it look like?

876
00:50:37,337 --> 00:50:39,841
I fixed us breakfast, silly.

877
00:50:39,974 --> 00:50:42,342
Aren't you supposed
to be a cop?

878
00:50:42,476 --> 00:50:44,177
This is what they call a clue.

879
00:50:45,547 --> 00:50:48,783
If I was a cop, I can have
your ass arrested for burglary.

880
00:50:48,917 --> 00:50:51,753
Mm... no,
it's only burglary

881
00:50:51,886 --> 00:50:54,589
if I trespass in conjunction
of depriving you

882
00:50:54,722 --> 00:50:57,659
of loss of property
or committing a felony.

883
00:50:57,792 --> 00:51:00,360
This is more like breaking
and entering-- eggs?

884
00:51:02,030 --> 00:51:04,866
Take your eggs
and get the fuck out, Becky.

885
00:51:08,135 --> 00:51:09,971
Why are you acting this way?

886
00:51:11,039 --> 00:51:12,941
I thought we were really
feeling each other.

887
00:51:13,942 --> 00:51:15,475
Rebecca...

888
00:51:16,678 --> 00:51:18,345
hear me when I say this.

889
00:51:19,413 --> 00:51:21,448
The other night was
a mistake, okay?

890
00:51:21,583 --> 00:51:24,619
And for that, I apologize.

891
00:51:24,752 --> 00:51:26,788
Now, I'm gonna say this
in the most polite way

892
00:51:26,921 --> 00:51:28,556
that I know how.

893
00:51:28,690 --> 00:51:32,459
Please stay away
from me and my wife.

894
00:51:33,528 --> 00:51:35,830
I'm really sorry,
Greg, but...

895
00:51:36,798 --> 00:51:39,634
you're gonna have to get used
to seeing a lot of me.

896
00:51:39,767 --> 00:51:41,069
I don't know
if you've noticed,

897
00:51:41,201 --> 00:51:43,671
but Joy and I are
getting pretty close.

898
00:51:43,805 --> 00:51:47,642
And, shit,
we're damn near besties.

899
00:51:47,775 --> 00:51:49,443
Have you lost your damn mind?

900
00:51:49,577 --> 00:51:52,647
Stay the fuck away from me
and my wife, you crazy bitch.

901
00:51:52,780 --> 00:51:55,215
Get your damn hands
off of me.

902
00:52:12,100 --> 00:52:14,234
So, how have you been?

903
00:52:16,904 --> 00:52:18,472
I've been better.

904
00:52:18,606 --> 00:52:20,173
Have you been taking
your medication

905
00:52:20,307 --> 00:52:22,677
and staying away
from the alcohol?

906
00:52:28,215 --> 00:52:29,884
When I saw you last time,

907
00:52:30,018 --> 00:52:34,122
you were so optimistic
about life and the future.

908
00:52:35,455 --> 00:52:36,958
What changed?

909
00:52:38,626 --> 00:52:42,462
We have to continue exploring
the trauma left on you

910
00:52:42,597 --> 00:52:45,633
when your parents left you alone
when you were a little girl.

911
00:52:45,767 --> 00:52:48,468
You know what, Doc?

912
00:52:48,603 --> 00:52:50,104
It's funny.

913
00:52:50,237 --> 00:52:52,874
Men want to act brand new
when you let them in.

914
00:52:53,007 --> 00:52:55,442
What do you mean,
let them in?

915
00:52:56,978 --> 00:53:01,649
I mean here, here...
and here.

916
00:53:01,783 --> 00:53:04,384
Rebecca, I warned you

917
00:53:04,519 --> 00:53:07,722
about falling too hard,
too fast.

918
00:53:07,855 --> 00:53:09,691
Mm...

919
00:53:09,824 --> 00:53:11,291
You don't understand.

920
00:53:11,425 --> 00:53:14,529
It's not him, okay?
It's his wife.

921
00:53:15,563 --> 00:53:20,367
Rebecca, are you having
an affair with a married man?

922
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:23,571
It's not an affair
if we're both in love.

923
00:53:24,639 --> 00:53:27,175
And his wife is getting
in the way of that.

924
00:53:29,777 --> 00:53:32,113
I just have
to get rid of her.

925
00:53:33,915 --> 00:53:35,717
You mean divorce?

926
00:53:39,386 --> 00:53:40,688
Sure.

927
00:53:40,822 --> 00:53:42,456

you were referring

928
00:53:42,590 --> 00:53:44,759
to harming his wife.

929
00:53:45,893 --> 00:53:48,228

you're obligated
to contact the authorities

931

themselves or others, so...

00:53:55,903 --> 00:53:57,972
...that couldn't be the case,
Dr. Robinson.

933
00:54:07,548 --> 00:54:10,350
Dr. Robinson,
will you excuse me?

934
00:54:10,484 --> 00:54:11,886
I need to use
the little girl's room.

Sorry to bother you.

I'm Sergeant Armstrong with

Oh, it's no bother at all.

How can I help you, Officer?

947
00:55:44,946 --> 00:55:47,014
I was wondering if you could
answer a few questions

948
00:55:47,148 --> 00:55:49,382
about your neighbor,
Greg Lawson.

He's a candidate
for the police academy,

if we move this inside?

956

So, how often do you communicate
with Greg and his wife, Joy?

he didn't want us to end.

Anyways, um...

He grabbed my arm,

into the police academy?

01:19:55,963 --> 01:19:57,498
Why?

1228
01:19:58,899 --> 01:20:00,334
What'd you do?

1229
01:20:00,467 --> 01:20:01,835
Nothing.
I didn't do anything.

1230
01:20:01,969 --> 01:20:04,004
- I swear.
- Greg...

1231
01:20:04,138 --> 01:20:06,373
do not lie to me.

1232
01:20:10,745 --> 01:20:13,147
All right, look...

1233
01:20:13,280 --> 01:20:16,016
while you were away
in Atlanta,

1234
01:20:16,150 --> 01:20:18,653
we shared a beer
and a joint together.

1235
01:20:18,787 --> 01:20:21,790
She wanted to show me
the Miltons' backyard.

1236
01:20:21,922 --> 01:20:23,324
So...

1237
01:20:23,457 --> 01:20:25,125
we went to the pool...

1238
01:20:26,795 --> 01:20:29,096
look, she jumped in,
and I went in after her,

1239
01:20:29,229 --> 01:20:30,497
because I thought
she was drowning.

1240
01:20:30,632 --> 01:20:33,334
But turns out
she wasn't drowning at all.

1241
01:20:34,435 --> 01:20:37,639
She tried to kiss me,
but I rejected her.

1242
01:20:37,772 --> 01:20:39,607
And I got out of the pool,
baby, and I came home.

1243
01:20:39,741 --> 01:20:42,042
That's it.
That's all that happened.

1244
01:20:43,611 --> 01:20:45,179
Baby...

1245
01:20:45,312 --> 01:20:46,980
say something, don't...

1246
01:20:48,982 --> 01:20:51,352
So you're telling me
that while I was out of town,

1247
01:20:51,485 --> 01:20:53,621
you went skinny-dipping
with that white bitch?

1248
01:20:53,755 --> 01:20:55,322
It wasn't like that.
That's not what

1249
01:20:55,456 --> 01:20:56,658
- I'm saying at all.
- Did you fuck her?

1250
01:20:56,791 --> 01:20:58,959
No, I didn't fuck her.
Are you serious, Joy?

1251
01:20:59,093 --> 01:21:00,829
How do I know that?

1252
01:21:04,965 --> 01:21:07,067
Damn it, I knew
from the moment I saw her,

1253
01:21:07,201 --> 01:21:09,336
I knew that bitch was trouble.

Feels like you're telling me
about any of this

1256
01:21:14,576 --> 01:21:17,077
because this bitch
done fucked up our house.

1257
01:21:22,282 --> 01:21:24,051
It's okay, it's cool.

1258
01:21:24,184 --> 01:21:26,086
It's okay,
because...

1259
01:21:27,488 --> 01:21:30,057
I'm gonna show this bitch
what crazy really looks like.

1260
01:21:31,125 --> 01:21:32,861
Get the fuck out my way.

1261
01:21:33,927 --> 01:21:36,531
Baby, wait.
Babe, what are you doing?

1262
01:21:37,998 --> 01:21:39,433
Joy.

1263
01:21:40,802 --> 01:21:43,838
Joy, what are you--
what are you doing?

1264
01:21:46,006 --> 01:21:48,710
Look, I don't-- I don't think
you have to talk to her.

1265
01:21:48,843 --> 01:21:50,712
Why don't you just let this
whole thing work itself out?
