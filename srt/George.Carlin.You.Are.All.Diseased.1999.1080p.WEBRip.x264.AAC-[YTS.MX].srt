1
00:00:42,409 --> 00:00:43,910
That's nice, thank you.

2
00:00:44,744 --> 00:00:45,945
Thanks very much.

3
00:00:46,513 --> 00:00:47,714
I appreciate it.

4
00:00:53,086 --> 00:00:55,688
Thank you very much.
Thank you all, thank you.

5
00:00:56,322 --> 00:00:57,724
I appreciate that.

6
00:00:58,224 --> 00:01:02,495
Thank you, thank you...
So, let me ask you something.

7
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:05,165
Let me ask you, how is everybody
doing tonight, huh?

8
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:12,405
Good, well, fuck you!

9
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:16,743
Just trying to make you feel at home.

10
00:01:18,077 --> 00:01:20,947
Now listen... I've been
out here all this time

11
00:01:21,014 --> 00:01:23,650
and I haven't been
complaining about anything yet,

12
00:01:23,716 --> 00:01:26,886
so I think it's time to go
into the complaint department.

13
00:01:27,687 --> 00:01:31,458
This is just a series of things
that are pissing me off.

14
00:01:31,524 --> 00:01:32,524
Okay?

15
00:01:33,059 --> 00:01:35,562
A series of things that are pissing me off,

16
00:01:35,628 --> 00:01:37,664
'cause I don't have pet peeves,

17
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:41,201
I have major psychotic
fucking hatreds, okay?

18
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:45,505
And it makes the world
a lot easier to sort out.

19
00:01:45,972 --> 00:01:49,275
First thing on my list
tonight... airport security.

20
00:01:49,342 --> 00:01:50,210
Tired of this shit.

21
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:51,744
There's too much of it,

22
00:01:51,811 --> 00:01:53,980
there's too much security at the airport.

23
00:01:54,047 --> 00:01:58,351
I'm tired of some guy with a double
digit IQ and a triple digit income

24
00:01:58,418 --> 00:02:03,256
rooting around inside of my bag for
no reason and never finding anything!

25
00:02:03,323 --> 00:02:04,724
Haven't found anything yet!

26
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:07,727
Haven't found one bomb in one bag!

27
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:10,954
And don't tell me, "Well, the terrorists
know their bags are gonna be searched",

28
00:02:10,978 --> 00:02:14,734
"so now they're leaving their bombs
at home." There are no bombs.

29
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:17,370
The whole thing is fucking pointless!

30
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:20,673
And it's completely without logic!

31
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:22,041
There's no logic at all!

32
00:02:22,108 --> 00:02:24,477
They'll take away a gun,
but let you keep a knife!

33
00:02:24,544 --> 00:02:26,012
Well, what the fuck is that?

34
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:32,352
In fact, there's a whole list of lethal
objects they will allow you to take on board.

35
00:02:32,418 --> 00:02:36,155
Theoretically, you could take... a knife,
an ice pick, a hatchet, a straight razor,

36
00:02:36,222 --> 00:02:40,226
a pair of scissors, a chainsaw, six knitting
needles, and a broken whiskey bottle,

37
00:02:40,293 --> 00:02:42,133
and the only thing
they're gonna say to you is,

38
00:02:42,157 --> 00:02:44,994
"That bag has to fit all the way
under the seat in front of you."

39
00:02:46,933 --> 00:02:50,603
And if you didn't take
the weapon on board, relax,

40
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:55,141
after you've been flying for about an hour,
they're gonna bring you a knife and fork.

41
00:02:56,276 --> 00:02:58,912
They actually give you a fucking knife!

42
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:03,416
It's only a table knife, but you
could kill a pilot with a table knife.

43
00:03:04,417 --> 00:03:08,988
Might take you a couple of minutes,
you know... especially if he's hefty, huh?

44
00:03:09,822 --> 00:03:13,760
Yeah, but you could get the job done,
if you really wanted to kill the prick.

45
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:17,530
Shit, there's a lot of things
you could use to kill a guy with,

46
00:03:17,597 --> 00:03:21,200
you could probably beat a guy to death with
the Sunday New York Times, couldn't you?

47
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:26,339
Or suppose you just have
really big hands.

48
00:03:26,406 --> 00:03:28,374
Couldn't you strangle a flight attendant?

49
00:03:28,441 --> 00:03:31,311
Shit, you could probably strangle
two of them, one with each hand...

50
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:34,791
you know, if you are lucky enough to
catch them in that little kitchen area...

51
00:03:35,615 --> 00:03:37,850
before they give out
the fucking peanuts, you know?

52
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:42,388
But you could get the job done,
if you really cared enough.

53
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:48,127
So, why is it they allow a man with big
powerful hands to get on board an airplane?

54
00:03:48,795 --> 00:03:50,063
I'll tell you why.

55
00:03:50,129 --> 00:03:52,065
They know he's not a security risk

56
00:03:52,131 --> 00:03:55,935
because he's already answered
the three big questions.

57
00:03:56,970 --> 00:04:00,473
Question number one: "Did
you pack your bags yourself?"

58
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:07,046
No, Carrot Top packed my bags.

59
00:04:09,115 --> 00:04:15,088
He... He and Martha Stewart and Florence
Henderson came over to the house last night,

60
00:04:15,655 --> 00:04:17,857
fixed me a lovely Lobster Newburg,

61
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:21,361
gave me a full body massage
with sacred oils from India,

62
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:25,665
performed a four-way around the
world, and then they packed my bags.

63
00:04:26,532 --> 00:04:28,001
Next question!

64
00:04:35,475 --> 00:04:38,444
"Have your bags been in your
possession the whole time?"

65
00:04:38,911 --> 00:04:44,417
No, usually, the night before I
travel, just as the moon is rising,

66
00:04:45,551 --> 00:04:48,921
I place my suitcases out on the street
corner and leave them there unattended

67
00:04:48,988 --> 00:04:52,825
for several hours... just for good luck.

68
00:04:54,327 --> 00:04:55,662
Next question!

69
00:04:57,063 --> 00:05:00,700
"Has any unknown person asked
you to take anything on board?"

70
00:05:01,234 --> 00:05:05,838
Hmm... Well, what exactly is
an "unknown person"?

71
00:05:06,673 --> 00:05:09,008
Surely, everyone is known to someone.

72
00:05:10,009 --> 00:05:14,147
In fact, just this morning,
Karim and Yusef Ali Bangaba

73
00:05:15,748 --> 00:05:17,717
seemed to know each other quite well.

74
00:05:18,384 --> 00:05:21,754
They kept joking about which one
of my suitcases was the heaviest.

75
00:05:23,356 --> 00:05:26,759
And that's another thing they
don't like at the airport... jokes.

76
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:30,163
You know? Yeah,
you can't joke about a bomb.

77
00:05:30,229 --> 00:05:31,898
But why is it just jokes?

78
00:05:31,964 --> 00:05:33,166
What about a riddle?

79
00:05:35,568 --> 00:05:36,936
How about a limerick?

80
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:39,672
How about a bomb anecdote?

81
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:43,443
You know... no punch line,
just a really cute story.

82
00:05:44,711 --> 00:05:49,649
Or suppose you intended to remark,
not as a joke, but as an ironic musing,

83
00:05:49,716 --> 00:05:51,684
are they prepared
to make that distinction?

84
00:05:51,751 --> 00:05:53,720
Why I think not.

85
00:05:54,587 --> 00:05:57,190
And besides, who's to say what's funny?

86
00:05:57,256 --> 00:06:00,526
Airport security is a stupid
idea, it's a waste of money,

87
00:06:00,593 --> 00:06:02,395
and it's only there for one reason:

88
00:06:02,462 --> 00:06:04,997
to make white people feel safe.

89
00:06:05,064 --> 00:06:06,199
That's all.

90
00:06:06,265 --> 00:06:10,603
The illusion, the feeling
and illusion of safety,

91
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:14,107
'cause the authorities know they
can't make an airplane completely safe,

92
00:06:14,173 --> 00:06:15,775
too many people have access.

93
00:06:15,842 --> 00:06:18,578
You notice the drug smugglers
don't seem to have a lot of trouble

94
00:06:18,644 --> 00:06:21,147
getting their little packages
on board, do they?

95
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:24,083
No, and God bless them too!

96
00:06:29,522 --> 00:06:34,627
Oh and by the way, an airplane
flight shouldn't be completely safe.

97
00:06:34,694 --> 00:06:36,763
You need a little danger in your life.

98
00:06:36,829 --> 00:06:39,365
Take a fucking chance
once in a while, will you?

99
00:06:39,866 --> 00:06:42,902
What are you gonna do? Play
with your prick for another 30 years?

100
00:06:44,137 --> 00:06:48,274
What, are you gonna read People Magazine
and eat at Wendy's till the end of time?

101
00:06:48,341 --> 00:06:50,710
Take a fucking chance!

102
00:06:50,777 --> 00:06:54,547
Besides, even if they made all
of the airplanes completely safe,

103
00:06:54,614 --> 00:06:58,317
the terrorists would simply start
bombing other places that are crowded:

104
00:06:58,384 --> 00:07:01,454
porn shops, crack houses,
titty bars, and gangbangs.

105
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:05,291
You know, entertainment venues.

106
00:07:06,025 --> 00:07:10,463
The odds of you being killed
by a terrorist are practically zero!

107
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:13,432
So, I say relax and enjoy the show.

108
00:07:13,499 --> 00:07:16,969
You have to be a realist, you
have to be realistic about terrorism.

109
00:07:17,036 --> 00:07:19,372
Certain groups of people...
certain groups:

110
00:07:19,438 --> 00:07:23,042
Muslim fundamentalists, Christian
fundamentalists, Jewish fundamentalists,

111
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:25,878
and just plain guys from Montana,

112
00:07:27,346 --> 00:07:32,585
are gonna continue to make life in this
country very interesting for a long, long time.

113
00:07:32,652 --> 00:07:38,057
That's the reality, angry men in combat
fatigues talking to God on a two-way radio

114
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:40,726
and muttering incoherent
slogans about freedom

115
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:44,397
are eventually gonna provide us
with a great deal of entertainment,

116
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:50,236
especially after your stupid fucking
economy collapses all around you

117
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:51,983
and the terrorists
come out of the woodwork

118
00:07:52,007 --> 00:07:53,773
and you'll have anthrax
in your water supply,

119
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,441
and saran gas in your air conditioner,

120
00:07:55,508 --> 00:07:58,711
there'll be chemical and biological
suitcase bombs in every city

121
00:07:58,778 --> 00:08:02,582
and I say, "Enjoy it, relax, enjoy
the show, take a fucking chance",

122
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:07,620
"put a little fun in your life." To me,
terrorism is exciting, it's exciting.

123
00:08:07,687 --> 00:08:11,090
I think the very idea that you
could set off a bomb in a marketplace

124
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:14,093
and kill several hundred people
is exciting and stimulating

125
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,462
and I see it as a form of entertainment!

126
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:19,532
Entertainment... that's all it is.

127
00:08:21,934 --> 00:08:22,934
Yeah.

128
00:08:25,271 --> 00:08:29,308
But... but I also know that most
Americans are soft and frightened

129
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:33,479
and unimaginative and they don't realize
there's such a thing as dangerous fun.

130
00:08:33,546 --> 00:08:36,949
And they certainly don't recognize
a good show when they see one!

131
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:40,386
I have always been willing to
put myself at great personal risk

132
00:08:40,453 --> 00:08:42,773
for the sake of entertainment,
and I've always been willing

133
00:08:42,797 --> 00:08:45,634
to put you at great personal
risk for the same reason.

134
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:49,896
As far as I'm concerned, all of
this airport security, all the searches,

135
00:08:49,962 --> 00:08:52,164
the screenings,
the cameras, the questions,

136
00:08:52,231 --> 00:08:55,167
it's just one more way
of reducing your liberty,

137
00:08:55,234 --> 00:08:59,305
and reminding you that they can
fuck with you anytime they want

138
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:03,309
as long as you put up with it...
as long as you put up with it,

139
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:06,178
which means, of course,
anytime they want,

140
00:09:06,245 --> 00:09:07,780
'cause that's what Americans do now,

141
00:09:07,847 --> 00:09:10,816
they're always willing to trade
away a little of their freedom

142
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:14,820
in exchange for the feeling,
the illusion of security.

143
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:18,557
What we have now is
a completely neurotic population

144
00:09:18,624 --> 00:09:24,463
obsessed with security and safety and
crime and drugs and cleanliness and hygiene

145
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:27,900
and germs...
there's another thing... germs.

146
00:09:27,967 --> 00:09:31,337
Where did this sudden fear of
germs come from in this country?

147
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:32,505
Have you noticed this?

148
00:09:32,571 --> 00:09:34,540
The media, constantly running stories

149
00:09:34,607 --> 00:09:37,843
about all the latest infections:
salmonella, E-coli,

150
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:40,846
hanta virus, bird flu,
and... and Americans are...

151
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:43,316
They panic easily, so now
everybody's running around,

152
00:09:43,382 --> 00:09:46,052
scrubbing this and spraying that
and overcooking their food

153
00:09:46,118 --> 00:09:50,323
and repeatedly washing their hands,
trying to avoid all contact with germs.

154
00:09:50,389 --> 00:09:53,793
It's ridiculous and it goes
to ridiculous lengths.

155
00:09:53,859 --> 00:09:57,063
In prisons, before they give you
a lethal injection,

156
00:09:57,129 --> 00:09:59,498
they swab your arm with alcohol!

157
00:09:59,565 --> 00:10:02,735
It's true!

158
00:10:02,802 --> 00:10:06,939
It's true! It's true!

159
00:10:07,006 --> 00:10:08,006
Well...

160
00:10:10,576 --> 00:10:12,845
Well, they don't want you
to get an infection!

161
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:17,516
And you could see their point, wouldn't
want some guy to go to hell and be sick!

162
00:10:18,818 --> 00:10:21,821
It would take a lot of the
sportsmanship out of the whole execution.

163
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:25,992
Fear of germs...
why these fucking pussies!

164
00:10:27,159 --> 00:10:29,829
You can't even get
a decent hamburger anymore!

165
00:10:29,895 --> 00:10:31,530
They cook the shit out of everything now

166
00:10:31,597 --> 00:10:34,200
'cause everybody's afraid
of food poisoning!

167
00:10:34,266 --> 00:10:35,935
Hey, where's your sense of adventure?

168
00:10:36,002 --> 00:10:37,970
Take a fucking chance, will you?

169
00:10:38,037 --> 00:10:41,640
You know how many people die in this
country from food poisoning every year?

170
00:10:41,707 --> 00:10:44,844
Nine thousand... that's all,
it's a minor risk!

171
00:10:46,712 --> 00:10:50,416
Take a fucking chance...
bunch of goddamn pussies!

172
00:10:51,517 --> 00:10:55,087
Besides, what do you think
you have an immune system for?

173
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:57,123
It's for killing germs!

174
00:10:57,189 --> 00:11:00,659
But it needs practice...
it needs germs to practice on.

175
00:11:02,194 --> 00:11:04,130
So... so, listen!

176
00:11:05,197 --> 00:11:06,197
So, listen.

177
00:11:07,867 --> 00:11:12,004
If you kill all the germs around
you, and live a completely sterile life,

178
00:11:12,071 --> 00:11:14,840
then when germs do come along,
you're not gonna be prepared.

179
00:11:14,907 --> 00:11:18,644
And never mind ordinary germs, what
are you gonna do when some super virus

180
00:11:18,711 --> 00:11:22,214
comes along that turns your
vital organs into liquid shit?

181
00:11:22,948 --> 00:11:24,059
I'll tell you what you're gonna do...

182
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:25,683
you're gonna get sick, you're gonna die,

183
00:11:25,709 --> 00:11:27,829
and you're gonna deserve it
'cause you're fucking weak

184
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:30,089
and you got
a fucking weak immune system!

185
00:11:30,156 --> 00:11:32,858
Now... Yeah, goddammit.

186
00:11:35,094 --> 00:11:38,064
Hey. All right.

187
00:11:39,165 --> 00:11:42,668
Let me tell you a true story
about immunization, okay?

188
00:11:42,735 --> 00:11:45,805
When I was a little boy
in New York City in the 1940s,

189
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:50,910
we swam in the Hudson River, and
it was filled with raw sewage, okay?

190
00:11:50,976 --> 00:11:53,179
We swam in raw sewage!

191
00:11:53,245 --> 00:11:54,814
You know... to cool off!

192
00:11:56,715 --> 00:11:59,018
And at that time, the big fear was polio,

193
00:11:59,085 --> 00:12:02,021
thousands of kids died from polio
every year, but you know something?

194
00:12:02,088 --> 00:12:04,390
In my neighborhood,
no one ever got polio!

195
00:12:04,457 --> 00:12:05,591
No one! Ever!

196
00:12:05,658 --> 00:12:08,661
You know why?
'Cause we swam in raw sewage!

197
00:12:09,862 --> 00:12:12,331
It strengthened our immune systems!

198
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:16,469
The polio never had a prayer,
we were tempered in raw shit!

199
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:23,709
So... so, personally, I never take
any special precautions against germs.

200
00:12:23,776 --> 00:12:27,056
I don't shy away from people that sneeze
and cough, I don't wipe off the telephone,

201
00:12:27,113 --> 00:12:31,417
I don't cover the toilet seat, and if I drop
food on the floor, I pick it up and eat it!

202
00:12:31,784 --> 00:12:35,187
I eat it! Yes, I do.

203
00:12:37,756 --> 00:12:40,126
Even if I'm at a sidewalk café!

204
00:12:40,693 --> 00:12:41,861
In Calcutta!

205
00:12:43,028 --> 00:12:44,363
The poor section!

206
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:47,299
On New Year's morning
during a soccer riot!

207
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:51,971
And you know something? In spite
of all that so-called risky behavior,

208
00:12:52,037 --> 00:12:54,640
I never get infections, I don't
get them, I don't get colds,

209
00:12:54,707 --> 00:12:56,267
I don't get flu, I don't get headaches,

210
00:12:56,293 --> 00:12:58,213
I don't get upset stomach,
and I... You know why?

211
00:12:58,262 --> 00:13:02,148
'Cause I got a good strong immune
system and it gets a lot of practice.

212
00:13:02,214 --> 00:13:05,117
My immune system is equipped
with the biological equivalent

213
00:13:05,184 --> 00:13:09,622
of fully automatic military assault
rifles with night vision and laser scopes,

214
00:13:10,156 --> 00:13:12,791
and we have recently acquired
phosphorous grenades,

215
00:13:12,858 --> 00:13:16,061
cluster bombs, and
anti-personnel fragmentation mines.

216
00:13:16,562 --> 00:13:20,666
So, when my white blood cells are on
patrol recon ordering my blood stream

217
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:24,036
seeking out strangers and other
undesirables, if they see any...

218
00:13:24,103 --> 00:13:28,107
any suspicious looking germs of
any kind, they don't fuck around!

219
00:13:28,908 --> 00:13:31,777
They whip out the wa... weapons,
they wax the motherfucker

220
00:13:31,844 --> 00:13:34,947
and deposit the unlucky fellow
directly into my colon!

221
00:13:35,447 --> 00:13:37,082
Into my colon!

222
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:39,752
There's no nonsense,
there's no Miranda warning,

223
00:13:39,818 --> 00:13:42,058
there's none of that "three
strikes and you're out" shit,

224
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:45,457
first defense, bam...
into the colon you go!

225
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:49,361
Yeah! Yeah! Sure!

226
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:54,333
Yeah! Hey. All right. Oh...

227
00:13:56,702 --> 00:13:58,837
And speaking of my colon,

228
00:13:59,705 --> 00:14:02,441
I want you to know I don't
automatically wash my hands

229
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:06,712
every time I go to the bathroom,
okay? Can you deal with that?

230
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:10,349
Sometimes I do, sometimes I don't.

231
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:11,884
You know when I wash my hands?

232
00:14:11,951 --> 00:14:13,285
When I shit on them!

233
00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:16,722
That's the only time.

234
00:14:16,789 --> 00:14:18,157
That's the o...

235
00:14:18,224 --> 00:14:19,692
And you know how often that happens?

236
00:14:19,758 --> 00:14:23,062
Tops, tops, two,
three times a week, tops!

237
00:14:23,128 --> 00:14:24,763
Tops!

238
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:28,300
Maybe a little more frequently over
the holidays, you know what I mean?

239
00:14:29,268 --> 00:14:32,905
And I'll tell you something
else, my well-scrubbed friends...

240
00:14:32,972 --> 00:14:35,808
you don't always need to shower
every day, did you know that?

241
00:14:35,874 --> 00:14:39,111
It's overkill, unless you
work out or work outdoors,

242
00:14:39,178 --> 00:14:41,347
or for some reason
come in intimate contact

243
00:14:41,413 --> 00:14:45,718
with huge amounts of filth and garbage
every day, you don't always need to shower.

244
00:14:45,784 --> 00:14:49,555
All you really need to do
is to wash the four key areas:

245
00:14:50,155 --> 00:14:52,491
armpits, asshole, crotch, and teeth.

246
00:14:53,626 --> 00:14:56,895
Got that? Armpits, asshole,
crotch, and teeth.

247
00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:00,766
In fact, you can save yourself
a whole lot of time

248
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:04,670
if you simply use the same brush
on all four areas!

249
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:08,107
Thank you!

250
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:13,612
Hey, thank you.

251
00:15:14,713 --> 00:15:16,415
I appreciate it, thank you.

252
00:15:17,983 --> 00:15:23,222
All right, now, listen... I got a few more
items of things that are pissing me off,

253
00:15:23,289 --> 00:15:25,624
and this one comes
in the form of a question.

254
00:15:26,325 --> 00:15:30,429
Haven't we had about enough of
this cigar-smoking shit in this country?

255
00:15:30,496 --> 00:15:33,999
Huh? Huh? Thank you. God!

256
00:15:34,466 --> 00:15:35,901
When is this gonna end?

257
00:15:36,368 --> 00:15:38,070
When is this shit gonna go away?

258
00:15:38,137 --> 00:15:42,408
When are these fat, arrogant, overpaid,
overfed, overprivileged, overindulged,

259
00:15:42,474 --> 00:15:46,111
white-collared, business-criminal,
asshole cocksuckers

260
00:15:47,379 --> 00:15:51,817
gonna put out their cigars and
move along to their next abomination...

261
00:15:52,384 --> 00:15:57,356
white pussy businessmen
sucking on a big brown dick?

262
00:15:57,423 --> 00:16:02,194
That's all it is. That's all it is.

263
00:16:02,261 --> 00:16:07,232
That's all it ever was...
Yeah! A big brown dick!

264
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:12,604
Sigmund Freud said, "Sometimes
a cigar is just a cigar." Oh, yeah?

265
00:16:12,671 --> 00:16:15,474
Well, sometimes it's a big brown dick...

266
00:16:17,543 --> 00:16:19,411
with a fat, arrogant, white-collared,

267
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:22,781
business-criminal asshole
sucking on the wet end of it!

268
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:27,953
But hey, hey, the news is
not all bad for me, not all bad,

269
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:30,956
you wanna know the good part?
Cancer of the mouth.

270
00:16:31,423 --> 00:16:32,891
Good! Fuck 'em!

271
00:16:33,859 --> 00:16:38,530
Makes me happy, it's an attractive
disease... goes nice with a cell phone!

272
00:16:40,299 --> 00:16:45,337
So light up, suspender man, and suck
that smoke deep down into your empty suit

273
00:16:45,404 --> 00:16:48,407
and blow it out your ass,
you fucking cocksucker!

274
00:16:48,474 --> 00:16:53,078
Now... Thank you. Thank you.

275
00:16:54,780 --> 00:17:00,386
Hey... here's another question
I've been pondering...

276
00:17:01,553 --> 00:17:05,157
what is all this shit about
angels? Have you heard this?

277
00:17:05,224 --> 00:17:08,594
Yeah... three out of four people
now believe in angels.

278
00:17:09,395 --> 00:17:11,363
What are you, fucking stupid?

279
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:16,602
Has everybody lost their
fucking mind in this country?

280
00:17:17,169 --> 00:17:19,538
Angels... Shit!
You know what I think it is?

281
00:17:19,605 --> 00:17:23,809
I think it's a massive, collective,
psychotic, chemical flashback

282
00:17:24,643 --> 00:17:30,749
of all the drugs, all the drugs smoked,
swallowed, snorted, shot, and absorbed rectally

283
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:34,987
by all Americans from 1960 to 1990,

284
00:17:35,053 --> 00:17:37,289
30 years of adulterated street drugs

285
00:17:37,356 --> 00:17:39,992
will get you
some fucking angels, my friend!

286
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:44,196
Angels... Shit! What about goblins, huh?

287
00:17:44,263 --> 00:17:46,231
Doesn't anybody believe in goblins?

288
00:17:46,298 --> 00:17:48,200
Never hear about them
except on Halloween,

289
00:17:48,267 --> 00:17:50,736
and it's always
negative shit too, you know?

290
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:54,606
And zombies... where the
fuck are all the zombies?

291
00:17:56,074 --> 00:17:58,811
That's the trouble with zombies,
they're unreliable.

292
00:18:00,078 --> 00:18:02,080
I say if you're gonna buy the angel shit

293
00:18:02,147 --> 00:18:04,616
you might as well go
for the zombie package as well.

294
00:18:06,051 --> 00:18:11,423
Here's another horrifying example,
an aspect of American culture,

295
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:14,359
the... the... the pussification,
the continued...

296
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:18,530
the continued pussification
of the American male

297
00:18:19,164 --> 00:18:20,866
in the form...

298
00:18:22,234 --> 00:18:25,337
Yeah? All right.

299
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:31,143
In the form of Harley Davidson
theme restaurants.

300
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:34,913
What the fuck is going on here?

301
00:18:35,314 --> 00:18:38,217
Harley Davidson used
to mean something.

302
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:43,288
It stood for biker attitude, grimy
outlaws and their sweaty mamas

303
00:18:43,355 --> 00:18:46,859
full of beer and crank,
rolling around on Harleys,

304
00:18:46,925 --> 00:18:50,529
looking for a good time, destroying
property, raping teenagers,

305
00:18:50,596 --> 00:18:57,436
and killing policemen... all very
necessary activities, by the way.

306
00:18:58,003 --> 00:19:00,038
But now? Theme restaurants.

307
00:19:00,105 --> 00:19:03,842
And this soft shit obviously
didn't come from hardcore bikers,

308
00:19:03,909 --> 00:19:06,545
it came from these weekend
motorcyclists,

309
00:19:06,612 --> 00:19:09,214
these fraudulent two-day-a-week
motherfuckers

310
00:19:09,281 --> 00:19:13,418
who have their bikes trucked into
Sturgis, South Dakota, for the big rally

311
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:16,355
and then ride around like
they just came in off the road.

312
00:19:16,421 --> 00:19:20,626
Dentists and bureaucrats
and pussy-boy software designers

313
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:24,196
getting up on a Harley 'cause
they think it makes them cool.

314
00:19:24,263 --> 00:19:26,732
Well, hey, skeezics, you ain't cool,

315
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:31,537
you're fucking chilli and
chilli ain't never been cool.

316
00:19:32,731 --> 00:19:35,131
And here... as long as we're
talking about theme restaurants,

317
00:19:35,155 --> 00:19:36,408
I got a proposition for you.

318
00:19:36,475 --> 00:19:40,946
I think if white people are
gonna burn down black churches,

319
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:44,616
then black people ought to
burn down the House of Blues!

320
00:19:44,917 --> 00:19:48,587
Huh? What a fucking disgrace that place is!

321
00:19:48,654 --> 00:19:50,355
The House of Blues...
they ought to call it

322
00:19:50,422 --> 00:19:52,991
the House of Lame
White Motherfuckers,

323
00:19:54,326 --> 00:19:59,131
inauthentic, low frequency,
single-digit, lame, white motherfuckers...

324
00:19:59,197 --> 00:20:03,535
especially these male movie
stars who think they're blues artists.

325
00:20:03,602 --> 00:20:06,371
You ever see these guys? Don't
you just wanna puke in your soup

326
00:20:06,438 --> 00:20:10,375
when one of these fat, balding, overweight,
overaged, out of shape, middle aged,

327
00:20:10,442 --> 00:20:14,780
male movie stars with sunglasses jumps on
stage and starts blowing into a harmonica?

328
00:20:14,846 --> 00:20:17,015
It's a fucking sacrilege!

329
00:20:17,983 --> 00:20:20,218
In the first place... in the first place,

330
00:20:20,285 --> 00:20:25,023
white people got no business
playing the blues ever at all

331
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:29,294
under any circumstances
ever, ever, ever!

332
00:20:30,228 --> 00:20:33,432
What the fuck do white people
have to be blue about?

333
00:20:34,032 --> 00:20:36,602
Banana Republic ran out of khakis?

334
00:20:36,668 --> 00:20:41,173
Huh?

335
00:20:41,607 --> 00:20:44,176
The espresso machine is jammed?

336
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:47,446
Hootie and the Blowfish
are breaking up?

337
00:20:49,147 --> 00:20:53,318
Shit, white people ought to understand
their job is to give people the blues,

338
00:20:53,385 --> 00:20:58,156
not to get them... and certainly
not to sing or play them.

339
00:20:58,183 --> 00:20:59,823
Tell you a little secret about the blues,

340
00:20:59,847 --> 00:21:01,927
it's not enough to know
which notes to play,

341
00:21:01,994 --> 00:21:05,897
you gotta know why they need
to be played, and another thing...

342
00:21:05,964 --> 00:21:10,869
I don't think... I don't think white people
should be trying to dance like blacks.

343
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:12,104
Stop that!

344
00:21:13,739 --> 00:21:16,742
Stick to your faggoty polkas and waltzes

345
00:21:18,143 --> 00:21:23,915
and that repulsive country line-dancing
shit that you do, and be yourself,

346
00:21:23,982 --> 00:21:28,387
be proud, be white, be lame,
and get the fuck off the dance floor!

347
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:35,394
Now... Ah, thank you.

348
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:36,728
Now, listen...

349
00:21:38,196 --> 00:21:40,399
long as we're discussing minorities,

350
00:21:41,667 --> 00:21:43,468
I'd like to mention
something about language.

351
00:21:43,535 --> 00:21:48,240
There are a couple of terms being used
a lot these days by guilty white liberals.

352
00:21:48,306 --> 00:21:52,577
First one is "happens to be."
"He happens to be black."

353
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:55,313
"I have a friend
who happens to be black."

354
00:21:56,014 --> 00:21:57,949
Like it's a fucking accident, you know?

355
00:21:59,918 --> 00:22:01,987
Happens to be black?
"Yes, he happens to be black."

356
00:22:02,054 --> 00:22:05,457
Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
he had two black parents?

357
00:22:05,524 --> 00:22:07,526
"Oh, yes, yes he did. Yes, that's right."

358
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:09,394
Ah! And they fucked?

359
00:22:09,461 --> 00:22:12,397
"Oh, indeed they did... indeed they did."

360
00:22:12,464 --> 00:22:14,800
So where does
the surprise part come in?

361
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:19,738
I should think it would be more unusual
if he just happened to be Scandinavian!

362
00:22:23,075 --> 00:22:26,478
And the other term is "openly."
"Openly gay."

363
00:22:26,545 --> 00:22:31,616
They say "he's openly gay." But
that's the only minority they use that for.

364
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:34,119
You know, you wouldn't say
someone was "openly black."

365
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:39,925
Well, maybe James Brown...
or Louis Farrakhan,

366
00:22:39,991 --> 00:22:42,728
Louis Farrakhan is openly black.

367
00:22:43,361 --> 00:22:45,697
Colin Powell is not openly black,

368
00:22:46,465 --> 00:22:51,403
Colin Powell is openly white,
he just happens to be black.

369
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:55,240
Thank you. Thank you!

370
00:22:55,741 --> 00:23:01,780
Thank you! Yeah...
Oh! Thank you. Thank you.

371
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:05,584
And while we're at it,
when did the word "urban"

372
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:08,120
become synonymous
with the word "black"?

373
00:23:08,186 --> 00:23:10,322
Did I fall asleep for eight or nine years?

374
00:23:10,822 --> 00:23:14,793
Urban styles, urban trends, urban
music, I was not consulted on this at all,

375
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:18,029
didn't get an email, didn't get a
fax, didn't get a fucking postcard,

376
00:23:18,096 --> 00:23:19,831
fine, let them go,

377
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:24,136
and I don't think white women should
be calling each other "girlfriend," okay?

378
00:23:24,936 --> 00:23:27,205
Stop pretending to be black!

379
00:23:27,773 --> 00:23:29,174
And no matter what color you are,

380
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:31,743
"You go, girl" should probably go!

381
00:23:34,379 --> 00:23:40,452
Right along... Right along with "You
da man." "Hey, you da man!" Oh, yeah?

382
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:42,454
Well, you da fucking honky!

383
00:23:46,124 --> 00:23:49,194
Now, something
a little more positive for you,

384
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:51,863
don't want you to think the
whole show is just negativity.

385
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:53,532
This is about a festival.

386
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:57,569
This is my idea for one of those
big outdoor summer festivals.

387
00:23:57,636 --> 00:24:02,174
This is called "slug-fest."
This is for men only.

388
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:06,545
Here's what you do... you get
about 100,000 of these fucking men,

389
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:10,182
- you know the ones I mean, these macho motherfuckers...
- Whoo!

390
00:24:10,248 --> 00:24:13,418
...yeah, these strutting,
preening, posturing,

391
00:24:13,485 --> 00:24:18,723
hairy, sweaty, alpha-male
jackoffs... the muscle assholes.

392
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:21,993
You take about 100,000
of these disgusting pricks

393
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:26,331
and you throw them in a big
dirt arena, big 25-acre dirt arena

394
00:24:26,398 --> 00:24:31,303
and you just let them beat the shit
out of each other for 24 hours nonstop,

395
00:24:31,369 --> 00:24:34,706
no food, no water,
just whiskey and PCP!

396
00:24:36,908 --> 00:24:40,512
And you just let them punch and
pound and kick the shit out of each other

397
00:24:40,579 --> 00:24:42,547
until only one guy is left standing,

398
00:24:42,614 --> 00:24:44,654
then you take that guy
and you put him on a pedestal

399
00:24:44,716 --> 00:24:46,852
and you shoot him in the fucking head!

400
00:24:46,918 --> 00:24:51,022
Yeah. Yeah.

401
00:24:53,258 --> 00:24:55,126
Then you put the whole thing on TV.

402
00:24:55,627 --> 00:24:58,063
Budweiser would jump
at that shit in half a minute...

403
00:24:58,597 --> 00:25:00,565
and guys would volunteer,
guys would line up,

404
00:25:00,632 --> 00:25:03,768
all you gotta do is promise them
a small appliance of some kind.

405
00:25:04,236 --> 00:25:06,036
Men will do anything,
just give them something

406
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:08,429
that plugs in the wall
and makes a whirring noise.

407
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:15,380
Here's another male cliché... these guys
that cut the sleeves off of their T-shirts

408
00:25:15,447 --> 00:25:18,783
so the rest of us can have an
even more compelling experience

409
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:20,819
of smelling their armpits.

410
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:24,689
I say, "Hey Bruno,
shut it down, would you please?"

411
00:25:25,156 --> 00:25:28,193
You smell like an anchovy's cunt, okay?

412
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:34,566
Ugh... not good. Ugh... ugh...

413
00:25:34,933 --> 00:25:38,270
Whoa... not good, Bruno,

414
00:25:38,336 --> 00:25:40,739
"and definitely not for sharing."

415
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:45,076
This is the same kind of guy
that has that barbed wire tattoo

416
00:25:45,143 --> 00:25:48,380
that goes all the way around the
bicep. You've seen that, haven't you?

417
00:25:48,446 --> 00:25:53,084
That's just what I need, some guy who
hasn't been laid since the bicentennial

418
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:56,955
wants me to think he's
a "bad mother fuck a"

419
00:25:57,022 --> 00:25:59,357
because he's got a picture... Aah-aah!

420
00:25:59,424 --> 00:26:01,826
A painting of some barbed wire on his...

421
00:26:01,854 --> 00:26:04,654
I say, "Hey, Junior, come around
when you have the real thing on there,

422
00:26:04,678 --> 00:26:07,347
I'll squeeze that shit on
good and tight for ya, okay?"

423
00:26:07,799 --> 00:26:10,735
No kidding, no kidding,
this is the same kind of guy,

424
00:26:10,802 --> 00:26:15,206
that if you... if you smashed him in the face
eight or nine times with a big chunk of concrete,

425
00:26:15,273 --> 00:26:19,010
and then beat him over the head with a steel
rod for an hour and a half, you know what?

426
00:26:19,077 --> 00:26:21,379
He'd drop like a fucking rock.

427
00:26:21,746 --> 00:26:23,848
Like a rock.

428
00:26:25,016 --> 00:26:27,686
Here's another guy thing that sucks...

429
00:26:27,752 --> 00:26:31,256
these T-shirts that say, "Lead,
follow, or get out of the way."

430
00:26:31,323 --> 00:26:34,926
You ever see that? This is more
of that stupid Marine Corps bullshit,

431
00:26:35,327 --> 00:26:39,331
obsolete, male impulses
from 100,000 years ago.

432
00:26:39,397 --> 00:26:41,333
"Lead, follow, or get out of the way!"

433
00:26:41,399 --> 00:26:42,999
You know what I do
when I see that shirt?

434
00:26:43,023 --> 00:26:44,324
I obstruct!

435
00:26:45,403 --> 00:26:49,107
I stand right in the guy's path, force him
to walk around me, gets a little past me,

436
00:26:49,135 --> 00:26:51,455
I spin him around, kick him
in the nuts, rip off the shirt,

437
00:26:51,479 --> 00:26:53,945
wipe it on my ass, and shove
it down his fucking throat!

438
00:26:54,012 --> 00:26:57,248
That's what I do when I see that shirt.

439
00:26:58,850 --> 00:27:01,586
Yeah. Hey, listen...

440
00:27:01,987 --> 00:27:05,256
that's all these marines
are looking for... a good time.

441
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:07,726
And speaking of tough guys,

442
00:27:07,792 --> 00:27:11,129
I'm getting a little tired of
hearing that after six policemen

443
00:27:11,196 --> 00:27:14,966
get arrested for shoving a floor
lamp up some black guy's ass

444
00:27:15,033 --> 00:27:16,735
and ripping his intestines out,

445
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:20,271
the police department announces
they're gonna have sensitivity training.

446
00:27:21,206 --> 00:27:24,676
I say, "Hey, if you need special
training to be told not to jam

447
00:27:24,743 --> 00:27:27,846
a large cumbersome object
up someone else's asshole,

448
00:27:27,912 --> 00:27:31,883
maybe you're too fucked up to be on
the police force in the first place, huh?"

449
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:37,622
Maybe, maybe not, maybe not,
I don't know, listen... yeah.

450
00:27:37,689 --> 00:27:38,857
That's right.

451
00:27:42,989 --> 00:27:45,789
You know what they ought to do?
They ought to have two new requirements

452
00:27:45,813 --> 00:27:49,183
for being on the police:
intelligence and decency!

453
00:27:49,401 --> 00:27:51,703
You never can tell, it might just work,

454
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:54,039
it certainly hasn't been tried yet.

455
00:27:54,939 --> 00:27:58,109
No one should ever have any
object placed inside their asshole

456
00:27:58,176 --> 00:28:02,414
that is larger than a fist and
less loving than a dildo, okay?

457
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:07,685
Now... now, this next thing
is about our president.

458
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,321
This is about our president.

459
00:28:11,056 --> 00:28:14,159
Bill Jeff, Bill Jeff, Bill Jeff,

460
00:28:14,225 --> 00:28:17,162
Clinton... I don't call him
"Clinton," I call him "Clit-tin'."

461
00:28:18,329 --> 00:28:22,434
"Clit-tin'. C-L-I-T, T-I-N apostrophe!"

462
00:28:23,068 --> 00:28:25,270
His big deal was JFK, isn't that right?

463
00:28:25,336 --> 00:28:28,406
Loved JFK, wanted to emulate JFK
in every way.

464
00:28:28,473 --> 00:28:31,876
Well, JFK's administration
was called "Camelot."

465
00:28:31,943 --> 00:28:34,145
Well, it really should've
been called "Come-a-lot,"

466
00:28:35,146 --> 00:28:37,348
'cause that's what he did, he came a lot!

467
00:28:38,043 --> 00:28:40,563
So Clinton's looking for a
legacy, that's what he should call...

468
00:28:40,587 --> 00:28:43,023
Well, maybe, "Come-a-little"
would be better for him

469
00:28:43,288 --> 00:28:45,528
'cause he came a little,
you know... little on the dress,

470
00:28:45,552 --> 00:28:47,354
little on the desk, not a whole lot, really.

471
00:28:47,525 --> 00:28:52,497
Hey, he was no match, no match
for Kennedy in the pussy department.

472
00:28:53,031 --> 00:28:55,834
Kennedy aimed high: Marilyn Monroe.

473
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:58,570
Clinton showed his dick
to a government clerk.

474
00:29:00,038 --> 00:29:02,907
There's a drop-off here.
There's a drop-off.

475
00:29:02,974 --> 00:29:04,776
Thank you.

476
00:29:07,312 --> 00:29:10,849
Thank you! Now... I appreciate it.

477
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:14,853
Something else I'm getting tired
of... there's all this stupid bullshit

478
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:17,956
we have to listen to
all the time about children.

479
00:29:18,022 --> 00:29:20,325
It's all you hear in this country... children.

480
00:29:20,391 --> 00:29:22,231
"Help the children!"
"What about the children?"

481
00:29:22,255 --> 00:29:24,162
"Save the children!"
You know what I say?

482
00:29:24,229 --> 00:29:26,965
Fuck the children! Fuck 'em!

483
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:30,969
They're getting
entirely too much attention!

484
00:29:31,369 --> 00:29:35,039
And I know what you're thinking, you say,
"Jesus, he's not gonna attack children is he?"

485
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:36,341
Yes, he is!

486
00:29:38,243 --> 00:29:40,745
He's going to attack children!

487
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:43,948
And remember,
this is Mr. Conductor talking,

488
00:29:44,015 --> 00:29:46,618
I know what I'm talking about!

489
00:29:46,684 --> 00:29:53,124
I know what I'm talking about!
And... I also know...

490
00:29:53,191 --> 00:29:56,127
I also know all you single dads
and soccer moms

491
00:29:56,194 --> 00:29:58,897
who think you're such fucking
heroes aren't gonna like this,

492
00:29:58,963 --> 00:30:01,099
but somebody's gotta
tell you for your own good,

493
00:30:01,166 --> 00:30:04,068
your children
are overrated and overvalued.

494
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:06,037
You've turned them into little cult objects,

495
00:30:06,104 --> 00:30:09,641
you have a child fetish,
and it's not healthy!

496
00:30:09,707 --> 00:30:14,078
And don't give me... don't give me
that weak shit, "Well, I love my children!"

497
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:15,180
Fuck you!

498
00:30:16,814 --> 00:30:20,151
Everybody loves their children,
doesn't make you special.

499
00:30:20,218 --> 00:30:22,620
John Wayne Gacy loved his children...

500
00:30:23,221 --> 00:30:25,823
kept them all right out
on the yard near the garage.

501
00:30:26,624 --> 00:30:28,259
That's not what I'm talking about.

502
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:32,730
What I'm talking about is this constant
mindless yammering in the media,

503
00:30:32,797 --> 00:30:36,134
this neurotic fixation
that somehow, everything...

504
00:30:36,201 --> 00:30:39,237
everything has to be
revolved around children.

505
00:30:39,304 --> 00:30:41,372
It's completely out of balance.

506
00:30:41,439 --> 00:30:44,776
Listen, there are a couple of things
about kids you have to remember.

507
00:30:44,842 --> 00:30:47,178
First of all, they're not all cute!

508
00:30:47,245 --> 00:30:48,245
Okay?

509
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:49,940
In fact, if you look at them close,

510
00:30:49,964 --> 00:30:52,067
some of them are rather
unpleasant-looking.

511
00:30:53,051 --> 00:30:55,520
And a lot of them
don't smell too good either,

512
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:57,660
the little ones in particular seem to have

513
00:30:57,684 --> 00:31:00,721
a kind of urine and sour milk
combination or something.

514
00:31:01,159 --> 00:31:04,929
Stay with me on this. The sooner you
face it, the better off you're gonna be.

515
00:31:05,463 --> 00:31:08,900
Second premise, not all
children are smart and clever.

516
00:31:08,967 --> 00:31:09,967
Got that?

517
00:31:10,001 --> 00:31:11,736
Kids are like any other group of people:

518
00:31:11,803 --> 00:31:14,639
a few winners, a whole lot of losers!

519
00:31:16,007 --> 00:31:20,979
There are a lot of loser kids out
there who simply aren't going anywhere,

520
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:23,548
and you can't save them all,
you can't save them all,

521
00:31:23,615 --> 00:31:25,495
you gotta let them go,
you gotta cut them loose,

522
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:27,285
you gotta stop overprotecting them,

523
00:31:27,352 --> 00:31:29,487
'cause you're making them too soft.

524
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:31,923
Today's kids are way too soft.

525
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:37,695
For one thing, there's too much emphasis
on safety: Child-proof medicine bottles

526
00:31:37,762 --> 00:31:41,532
and fireproof pajamas, child
restraints in car seats, and helmets!

527
00:31:41,599 --> 00:31:44,302
Bicycle, skateboard,
uh, baseball helmets!

528
00:31:44,369 --> 00:31:47,238
Kids have to wear helmets now
for everything but jerking off!

529
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:51,643
Grown-ups have taken
all the fun out of being a kid

530
00:31:51,709 --> 00:31:54,178
just to save a few thousand lives.

531
00:31:54,646 --> 00:31:59,550
It's pathetic! It's pathetic! What's happening is...

532
00:31:59,617 --> 00:32:02,820
All right, what's happening...
You know what it is?

533
00:32:02,887 --> 00:32:09,160
These baby-boomers, these soft, fruity baby-boomers
are raising an entire generation of soft,

534
00:32:09,227 --> 00:32:14,065
fruity kids who aren't even allowed to
have hazardous toys, for Christ's sakes!

535
00:32:14,132 --> 00:32:16,934
Hazardous toys, shit, whatever
happened to natural selection?

536
00:32:17,001 --> 00:32:18,369
Survival of the fittest?

537
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:20,271
The kid who swallows too many marbles

538
00:32:20,338 --> 00:32:22,640
doesn't grow up to have kids of his own!

539
00:32:22,707 --> 00:32:25,777
Simple as that! Simple!

540
00:32:25,843 --> 00:32:27,512
Nature! Nature!

541
00:32:28,713 --> 00:32:30,315
Nature knows best.

542
00:32:30,882 --> 00:32:35,153
We're saving entirely too many
lives in this country, of all ages.

543
00:32:35,219 --> 00:32:40,992
Nature should be allowed to do its job of killing
off the weak and sickly and ignorant people

544
00:32:41,059 --> 00:32:44,462
without interference from
airbags and batting helmets!

545
00:32:44,962 --> 00:32:48,533
Just think of it
as passive eugenics, okay?

546
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:52,904
Now, here's another example
of over protection.

547
00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:54,839
Did you ever notice on the TV news,

548
00:32:54,906 --> 00:32:59,243
every time some guy with an
AK-47 strolls onto a school yard

549
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:02,046
and kills three or four kids
and a couple of teachers,

550
00:33:02,113 --> 00:33:07,018
the next day, the next day, the
school is overrun with counselors

551
00:33:07,085 --> 00:33:09,454
and psychiatrists and grief counselors

552
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:12,323
and trauma therapists trying
to help the children cope?

553
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:16,861
Shit! When I was in school, someone came to
our school and killed three or four of us,

554
00:33:16,928 --> 00:33:18,896
we went right on with our arithmetic!

555
00:33:19,964 --> 00:33:26,637
"Thirty five classmates minus four equals 31."

556
00:33:28,039 --> 00:33:30,608
We were tough... we were tough.

557
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:33,411
I say if kids can handle
the violence at home,

558
00:33:33,478 --> 00:33:36,080
they ought to be able to handle
the violence in school.

559
00:33:37,048 --> 00:33:40,184
I'm not worried about guns in
school. You know what I'm waiting for?

560
00:33:40,251 --> 00:33:41,719
Guns in church.

561
00:33:42,587 --> 00:33:45,490
That's gonna be a lot of fun
and it'll happen, you watch,

562
00:33:45,556 --> 00:33:48,693
some nut will go...
fucking ape-shit in a church

563
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:51,763
and they'll refer to him
as a "disgruntled worshiper."

564
00:33:54,098 --> 00:33:58,870
Here... Here's another bunch of
ignorant shit... school uniforms.

565
00:33:58,936 --> 00:34:01,272
Bad theory, the idea that

566
00:34:01,339 --> 00:34:04,142
if kids wear uniforms to school,
it helps keep order.

567
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:08,279
Don't these schools do enough
damage making all these kids think alike?

568
00:34:08,346 --> 00:34:10,448
Now they're gonna get them
to look alike too?

569
00:34:10,815 --> 00:34:14,986
And it's not a new idea, I first saw
it in old newsreels from the 1930s,

570
00:34:15,052 --> 00:34:18,523
but it was hard to understand
'cause the narration was in German!

571
00:34:18,589 --> 00:34:21,225
All right.

572
00:34:23,327 --> 00:34:27,465
One more... Thank you. Thank you.

573
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:34,806
One more item about children,
and that is the superstitious nonsense

574
00:34:34,872 --> 00:34:38,109
that blames tobacco companies
for kids who smoke.

575
00:34:38,176 --> 00:34:42,814
Listen, kids don't smoke because
a camel in sunglasses tells them to,

576
00:34:43,714 --> 00:34:49,420
they smoke for the same reasons adults do,
because it relieves anxiety and depression.

577
00:34:49,487 --> 00:34:52,790
And you'd be anxious and depressed too
if you had to put up with these pathetic,

578
00:34:52,857 --> 00:34:57,061
insecure, striving, anal, yuppy
parents who enroll you in college

579
00:34:57,128 --> 00:35:00,631
before you're old enough to know
which side of the playpen smells the worst!

580
00:35:02,066 --> 00:35:05,303
And then they fill you full of Ritalin
and drag you all over town in search

581
00:35:05,369 --> 00:35:10,675
of meaningless structure: Little league,
club scouts, swimming, soccer, karate, piano,

582
00:35:10,741 --> 00:35:15,580
bagpipes, watercolors, witchcraft,
glass blowing, and dildo practice.

583
00:35:17,348 --> 00:35:21,319
They even... they even have
play dates, for Christ's sakes,

584
00:35:21,385 --> 00:35:23,788
playing is now done by appointment!

585
00:35:23,855 --> 00:35:26,891
Whatever happened to "you show me
your wee-wee and I'll show you mine?"

586
00:35:29,894 --> 00:35:35,299
Hey, no wonder kids smoke, it
helps... not as much as weed, but, hey...

587
00:35:35,366 --> 00:35:37,802
...you can't have everything.

588
00:35:37,869 --> 00:35:41,138
You know it's true, parents are
burning these kids out on structure.

589
00:35:41,205 --> 00:35:46,377
I think every day, all children should
have three hours of daydreaming.

590
00:35:46,444 --> 00:35:50,515
Just daydreaming, and... You could
use a little of it yourself by the way,

591
00:35:50,581 --> 00:35:53,518
just sit at the window, stare
at the clouds, it's good for you.

592
00:35:53,584 --> 00:35:57,154
If you wanna know how you can help
your children, leave them the fuck alone!

593
00:35:57,221 --> 00:36:02,126
Thank you very much.

594
00:36:04,762 --> 00:36:06,564
Thank you very much.

595
00:36:07,198 --> 00:36:09,300
What am I talking about? Okay.

596
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:14,005
All right, now, a little change of
pace, a little change of intensity.

597
00:36:14,030 --> 00:36:16,791
I want you to know what's on
television tonight on the other channels,

598
00:36:16,815 --> 00:36:20,085
always like people to know what it is
they're missing by listening to my shit.

599
00:36:20,811 --> 00:36:24,649
First of all, on the Playboy
channel... on the Playboy channel,

600
00:36:24,715 --> 00:36:28,352
yeah, tonight, they have one of those
new reality shows where the people at home

601
00:36:28,419 --> 00:36:32,323
send in their own tapes, it's called
"Home Videos of Bad Fucking."

602
00:36:33,791 --> 00:36:37,595
And speaking of that delightful
activity, I guess you know last week,

603
00:36:37,662 --> 00:36:41,265
Ricky Lake had a special program,
"Women Who Fake Orgasms,"

604
00:36:41,332 --> 00:36:44,735
so tonight, not to be outdone, Jerry
Springer has a night time special,

605
00:36:44,802 --> 00:36:46,904
"Men Who Fake Bowel Movements."

606
00:36:47,838 --> 00:36:50,708
Yeah, I think they're running
out of topics on those shows too.

607
00:36:50,775 --> 00:36:55,212
Sally Jesse's next show is "Rapists Who Force
Their Victims to Play 'Yatzee' Beforehand."

608
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:58,749
Getting a little strange on daytime TV.

609
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:03,721
Then, later on tonight on the Nostalgia
channel, they're gonna play back to back

610
00:37:03,788 --> 00:37:06,624
two of my favorite episodes
of "Little House on the Prairie,"

611
00:37:06,691 --> 00:37:11,062
first of all, the 1975 Christmas
show, "A Douchebag for Clara."

612
00:37:12,196 --> 00:37:13,364
Wasn't that good? Aw...

613
00:37:13,431 --> 00:37:15,566
And it was sad toward the end
when she cried

614
00:37:15,633 --> 00:37:17,668
'cause she stuck it in the wrong hole!

615
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:19,604
Yeah...

616
00:37:20,004 --> 00:37:24,075
But as they say in the U.S.
Navy, "There is no wrong hole."

617
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:28,379
And then, right after that,
they're gonna play

618
00:37:28,446 --> 00:37:30,881
my favorite "Little House
on the Prairie" of all time,

619
00:37:30,948 --> 00:37:33,317
"Missy Takes a Big Dump in the Woods."

620
00:37:34,211 --> 00:37:36,931
And that was interesting, I thought,
'cause she had on the high heels

621
00:37:36,955 --> 00:37:39,724
and the long dress, and it was fun
to watch how she had to maneuver

622
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:45,029
through the poison sumac, and they
didn't have toilet paper in those days,

623
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:48,232
she had to use a series of pinecones.

624
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,169
Yeah, and she was pulling them
in the wrong direction!

625
00:37:53,704 --> 00:37:56,474
Yes, I understand toward the end
of the show, they had to bleep out

626
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:58,609
a lot of screaming and foul language.

627
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:04,482
And then, hey, hey, later on
tonight on... on the Pay-Per-View...

628
00:38:04,548 --> 00:38:07,885
on Pay-Per-View, Willie Nelson...
Willie Nelson's concert is on

629
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:10,688
and TV Guide listed
all the songs he's gonna sing.

630
00:38:10,755 --> 00:38:14,225
He's gonna start out with one of
my favorites, "Too Drunk to Jerk Off."

631
00:38:15,292 --> 00:38:17,495
Isn't that a good one?
God, I love that song!

632
00:38:18,229 --> 00:38:21,832
Then he's gonna do a series of
love songs, "Kiss Me, I'm Coming."

633
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:25,936
Aw, that's a good one. "Kiss me,
I'm coming, hold me, I'm humming."

634
00:38:28,606 --> 00:38:32,943
Well, I can't help it, I am a romantic
and I do enjoy the sentimental tunes.

635
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:37,648
Here's a sad song, "I Should've
Fucked, Oh, 'Whatshername'."

636
00:38:39,517 --> 00:38:42,319
Remember that? "I should've
never played the game,

637
00:38:42,386 --> 00:38:45,389
I should've fucked, oh, 'whatshername'."

638
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:48,390
Here's one my mother
used to sing around the house,

639
00:38:48,426 --> 00:38:51,028
"Your Love Ran Down My Leg
and Now, You're Gone."

640
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:55,533
Yeah, yeah, that one always got to me.

641
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,135
I'm glad you feel the same way.

642
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:03,240
Here's a fine love song,
"You Blew My Mind, Now Blow Me."

643
00:39:03,307 --> 00:39:06,677
He's even...

644
00:39:08,579 --> 00:39:10,748
he's even gonna do
a Stevie Wonder song,

645
00:39:10,815 --> 00:39:13,217
"I Just Called To Say I Tested 'Positive'."

646
00:39:13,951 --> 00:39:16,921
Yeah. Well, you don't wanna leave
anybody out, you know what I mean?

647
00:39:16,987 --> 00:39:20,091
And hey, and hey, what would
a Willie Nelson show be

648
00:39:20,157 --> 00:39:22,393
without a couple of cowboy songs?

649
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:25,129
He's gonna do that one George

"Drinking Beer,
Taking a Shit, and Passing Out."

651
00:39:28,499 --> 00:39:31,268
Then he's gonna do a kind
of a traditional western song,

652
00:39:31,335 --> 00:39:33,871
one that Gene Autry used to sing
when I was a little boy,

653
00:39:33,938 --> 00:39:37,775
"It's Midnight in Montana and I
Can't Get My Dick Outta This Cow."

654
00:39:38,442 --> 00:39:40,911
Yeah.

655
00:39:40,978 --> 00:39:43,948
I love that song. I always liked it.

656
00:39:44,582 --> 00:39:46,650
Yeah. You know
why I like that song so much?

657
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:49,053
'Cause it's a real cowboy song.

658
00:39:49,887 --> 00:39:52,556
And by the way,
speaking of cattle-fucking,

659
00:39:54,024 --> 00:39:56,393
do you know why it is
when a rancher fucks a sheep,

660
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:58,329
he does so at the edge of a cliff?

661
00:39:58,763 --> 00:40:00,798
It's so the sheep will push back.

662
00:40:01,532 --> 00:40:05,503
Little something for ya.

663
00:40:07,638 --> 00:40:08,638
Yes.

664
00:40:09,573 --> 00:40:12,676
Just a little tip for you outdoors
men when you're out camping.

665
00:40:15,412 --> 00:40:19,917
Now, this next thing is
about names, that's all, names.

666
00:40:19,984 --> 00:40:25,656
Names are an interest of mine, not a hobby,
hobbies cost money, interests are free.

667
00:40:25,723 --> 00:40:29,193
This is just about names. Did you
ever notice how they name singles bars?

668
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:33,731
Singles bars all have the same kinda cutesy
little one-word names that end in 's'.

669
00:40:33,798 --> 00:40:38,169
Scamps, Tramps, Chaps, Rumors,
Cahoots, Cheers, Chances, Mingles, Risks,

670
00:40:38,235 --> 00:40:41,906
Gambits, Notions, hey, if I had a
singles bar, you know what I'd call it?

671
00:40:41,972 --> 00:40:45,209
Nipples and Dicks! Huh?

672
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:47,444
A little truth in advertising!

673
00:40:47,511 --> 00:40:49,513
The Sperm Club!

674
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:52,082
Snatch o' Rama!

675
00:40:53,184 --> 00:40:55,252
The Crotch-e-teria!

676
00:40:55,953 --> 00:40:57,888
Frankie's Fuckery!

677
00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:00,691
Café Vagina!

678
00:41:00,758 --> 00:41:02,626
Open all night!

679
00:41:04,428 --> 00:41:06,630
Well, I'm an old-fashioned guy.

680
00:41:07,031 --> 00:41:10,467
I'm old-fashioned because I believe
the name on the outside of a place

681
00:41:10,534 --> 00:41:13,237
ought to let you know
what's going on on the inside.

682
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:18,275
Here would be a good name for a
gay restaurant, "The Mouthful." Huh?

683
00:41:18,342 --> 00:41:22,446
Come on, that's clever shit, that's a double
pun goddammit, you didn't think of it!

684
00:41:23,848 --> 00:41:27,117
Besides, you don't have to
eat there if you don't want to.

685
00:41:27,184 --> 00:41:29,887
No, no, just go in, have a cocktail...

686
00:41:32,857 --> 00:41:34,158
...or a high-ball.

687
00:41:36,727 --> 00:41:39,864
Here's another name
I don't care for, TGI Fridays,

688
00:41:39,930 --> 00:41:42,399
you know these cutesy-ass
little places? TGI Fridays!

689
00:41:44,401 --> 00:41:49,240
That whole "T-G-I-F" thing was cute
for about an hour... about an hour...

690
00:41:49,306 --> 00:41:53,043
and that was 65 years ago when
someone first said it on the radio,

691
00:41:53,110 --> 00:41:56,881
not cute anymore, time to
start bombing these locations!

692
00:41:57,982 --> 00:42:01,151
TGI Fridays, if I had a place
like that, you know what I'd call it?

693
00:42:01,218 --> 00:42:05,756
HSIOW...
Holy Shit, It's Only Wednesday.

694
00:42:08,092 --> 00:42:11,528
I think people
would drink a lot more liquor

695
00:42:12,162 --> 00:42:14,465
if they thought
it was Wednesday all the time.

696
00:42:16,634 --> 00:42:18,969
Well, I'm just looking for a
little honesty in these names.

697
00:42:19,036 --> 00:42:20,905
A little honesty, that's not asking a lot.

698
00:42:20,971 --> 00:42:25,242
I'm thinking of opening up a motel
and calling it "The Sleep n' Fuck."

699
00:42:26,277 --> 00:42:28,746
Wouldn't that be
a good honest name for a motel?

700
00:42:28,812 --> 00:42:31,749
Who needs this "Shady Pines" bullshit?

701
00:42:31,815 --> 00:42:34,218
"The Sleep n' Fuck" motel,

702
00:42:34,618 --> 00:42:37,788
get me one of them big
neon signs, "Sleep... Fuck..."

703
00:42:38,856 --> 00:42:42,026
Sleep... Fuck... Sleep n' Fuck!

704
00:42:42,092 --> 00:42:45,529
Sleep n' Fuck! Sleep n' Fuck!
Sleep... Fuck...

705
00:42:46,096 --> 00:42:47,464
"Sleep... Fuck..."

706
00:42:47,531 --> 00:42:50,601
Sure.

707
00:42:52,369 --> 00:42:55,039
"Sleep n' Fuck! Sleep n' Fuck!"

708
00:42:55,105 --> 00:42:58,409
You put it right at the Jersey entrance
to the Holland tunnel, you know?

709
00:43:00,511 --> 00:43:03,311
Actually, "Fuck n' Sleep" would
be a little more accurate, wouldn't it?

710
00:43:03,647 --> 00:43:06,750
Best name for a motel would be "The
Fuck n' Smoke n' Sleep n' Roll Over

711
00:43:06,777 --> 00:43:08,977
and Get Out of Bed and Wash
Your Crotch and Grab a Bite,

712
00:43:09,001 --> 00:43:12,089
Two Cans of Mr. Pibb and Go
Home and Fuck a Whole Lot More."

713
00:43:12,556 --> 00:43:14,124
A whole lot more.

714
00:43:14,792 --> 00:43:18,429
'Cause that's all they ever have left in
those soda machines on Sunday night,

715
00:43:18,495 --> 00:43:21,465
Mr. Pibb and Diet Shasta Orange.

716
00:43:22,599 --> 00:43:26,670
And that yellow can of Canada
Dry Tonic Water that nobody wants!

717
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:35,245
And speaking of naming things, am I the
only person in this country who's laughing

718
00:43:35,312 --> 00:43:39,283
when these commercials come on
television for "Snapper Lawn Mowers?"

719
00:43:40,451 --> 00:43:45,055
Isn't there anyone else in this fading
Republic who knows what a snapper is?

720
00:43:45,456 --> 00:43:47,725
- Whoo!
- A snapper is a pussy, okay?

721
00:43:48,325 --> 00:43:51,528
That's what it means,
"snapper" means "pussy."

722
00:43:51,595 --> 00:43:56,200
It's derived from an older, more
specific term, "Snappin' Pussy,"

723
00:43:56,734 --> 00:43:58,435
which describes
a particular type of pussy,

724
00:43:58,502 --> 00:44:00,022
one with good, quick muscular control,

725
00:44:00,070 --> 00:44:01,872
kind of an elasticity in the vaginal wall

726
00:44:01,939 --> 00:44:04,099
that can grab a hold of you
and give you a decent hump,

727
00:44:04,123 --> 00:44:08,427
you know what I'm talking about.
A snappin' pussy!

728
00:44:10,514 --> 00:44:13,817
But now, now "snapper"
means any kind of pussy

729
00:44:13,884 --> 00:44:16,620
and they've named
a lawn mower company after it!

730
00:44:17,021 --> 00:44:22,793
Now, I have seen a few snappers in
my day, never seen one that'll cut grass!

731
00:44:24,261 --> 00:44:27,097
No, no, maybe do a little edging,

732
00:44:28,165 --> 00:44:30,501
a little edging along the
driveway after a party,

733
00:44:30,567 --> 00:44:32,369
that's all you can hope for.

734
00:44:33,203 --> 00:44:36,206
But you know, "weed whacker"
you can understand!

735
00:44:37,307 --> 00:44:40,677
Now, a lot of these company
names and product names

736
00:44:40,744 --> 00:44:43,981
are influenced by marketing
and advertising people

737
00:44:44,048 --> 00:44:46,517
and this next thing is about advertising.

738
00:44:46,583 --> 00:44:49,153
By the way, if you should have
any cognitive dissonance

739
00:44:49,219 --> 00:44:52,423
about the fact that I do
commercials for 10-10-220

740
00:44:52,489 --> 00:44:55,793
and still attack advertising up here, well,

741
00:44:55,859 --> 00:44:58,429
you're just gonna have to figure
that shit out on your own, okay?

742
00:44:59,430 --> 00:45:04,835
Now, this is called "Advertising Lullaby,"

743
00:45:04,902 --> 00:45:06,970
keeping in mind, of course,
that the whole purpose

744
00:45:07,037 --> 00:45:10,074
of advertising is to lull you to sleep.

745
00:45:10,941 --> 00:45:16,246
Quality, value, styles, service, selection,
convenience, economy savings, performance,

746
00:45:16,313 --> 00:45:20,284
experience, hospitality, low rates,
friendly service, name brands, easy terms,

747
00:45:20,350 --> 00:45:24,021
affordable prices, money-back
guarantee, free installation.

748
00:45:24,088 --> 00:45:28,225
Free admission, free appraisal, free alterations,
free delivery, free estimates, free home trial,

749
00:45:28,292 --> 00:45:29,560
and free parking.

750
00:45:29,626 --> 00:45:31,361
No cash? No problem.

751
00:45:31,428 --> 00:45:35,566
No kidding, no fuss, no muss, no risk, no
obligation, no red tape, no down payment,

752
00:45:35,632 --> 00:45:39,303
no entry fee, no hidden charges, no
purchase necessary, no one will call on you,

753
00:45:39,369 --> 00:45:41,839
no payments of interest till September.

754
00:45:41,905 --> 00:45:44,341
But...

755
00:45:45,509 --> 00:45:48,946
limited time only though, so act
now, order today, send no money,

756
00:45:49,012 --> 00:45:51,248
offer good while supplies last,
two to a customer,

757
00:45:51,315 --> 00:45:54,351
each item sold separately, batteries
not included, mileage may vary,

758
00:45:54,418 --> 00:45:57,888
all sales are final, allow six weeks
for delivery, some items not available,

759
00:45:57,955 --> 00:46:00,858
some assembly required,
some restrictions may apply.

760
00:46:01,425 --> 00:46:06,330
So, come on in... come on in...

761
00:46:06,396 --> 00:46:09,900
...come on in for a free
demonstration and a free consultation

762
00:46:09,967 --> 00:46:12,136

will help you make a selection that's just
right for you and just right for your budget,

00:46:19,243 --> 00:46:24,748
and say, don't forget to pick up your free

767
00:46:30,787 --> 00:46:33,223
yours for the asking,
no purchase necessary,

768
00:46:33,290 --> 00:46:35,359
it's our way of saying, "Thank you."

769
00:46:35,425 --> 00:46:39,730
And if you act now, we'll include an
extra, added, free, complementary,

770
00:46:39,796 --> 00:46:44,735
bonus gift, a classic, deluxe, custom,

00:46:44,801 --> 00:46:47,404
premium select, gourmet

772
00:46:47,471 --> 00:46:49,673
magnifying glass, and garden hose

773
00:46:50,407 --> 00:46:55,279
in a genuine, imitation, leather-style,
carrying case with authentic vinyl trim...

774
00:46:56,246 --> 00:46:58,882
yours for the asking,
no purchase necessary,

775
00:46:58,949 --> 00:47:00,984
it's our way of saying, "Thank you."

776
00:47:01,618 --> 00:47:05,589
Actually, it's our way of saying,
"Bend over just a little bit farther"

777
00:47:06,256 --> 00:47:10,794
so we can stick this big advertising
dick up your ass a little bit deeper! Pbbt!

778
00:47:10,861 --> 00:47:16,733
A little bit deeper! Pbbt! A little
bit deeper! Pbbt! Pbbt! Pbbt! Pbbt!

779
00:47:20,103 --> 00:47:25,242
"You miserable, no-good,
fucking consumer asshole!"

780
00:47:26,310 --> 00:47:28,412
'Cause you do know,
folks, living in this country,

781
00:47:28,478 --> 00:47:32,349
you're bound to know that every
time you're exposed to advertising,

782
00:47:32,416 --> 00:47:35,352
you realize once again,
that America's leading industry,

783
00:47:35,419 --> 00:47:38,989
America's most profitable
business is still the manufacture,

784
00:47:39,056 --> 00:47:42,125
packaging, distribution,
and marketing of bullshit...

785
00:47:42,593 --> 00:47:47,831
high quality, grade-A, prime
cut, pure American bullshit,

786
00:47:47,898 --> 00:47:51,401
and the sad part is, is that most
people seem to have been indoctrinated

787
00:47:51,468 --> 00:47:55,872
to believe that bullshit only comes
from certain places, certain sources:

788
00:47:55,939 --> 00:48:01,211
advertising, politics, salesmen...
not true, bullshit is everywhere,

789
00:48:01,278 --> 00:48:04,848
bullshit is rampant, parents are
full of shit, teachers are full of shit,

790
00:48:04,915 --> 00:48:09,019
clergymen are full of shit, and law
enforcement people are full of shit.

791
00:48:09,086 --> 00:48:13,523
This entire country... this entire country...

792
00:48:13,590 --> 00:48:17,561
is completely full of shit
and always has been,

793
00:48:17,628 --> 00:48:19,068
from the Declaration of Independence

794
00:48:19,096 --> 00:48:21,164
to the Constitution
of the Star Spangled Banner,

795
00:48:21,231 --> 00:48:24,101
it's still nothing more
than one big, steaming pile

796
00:48:24,167 --> 00:48:27,571
of red, white and blue,
all-American bullshit.

797
00:48:27,638 --> 00:48:32,109
Because think of how
we started... think of that.

798
00:48:32,175 --> 00:48:35,679
This country was founded
by a group of slave owners

799
00:48:35,746 --> 00:48:38,115
who told us, "All men are created equal."

800
00:48:38,482 --> 00:48:42,119
Oh, yeah... all men, except for
Indians and niggers and women, right?

801
00:48:42,552 --> 00:48:45,822
Always like to use that
authentic American language.

802
00:48:45,889 --> 00:48:50,594
This was a small group of unelected,
white, male, land-holding, slave owners

803
00:48:50,661 --> 00:48:55,165
who also suggested their class
be the only one allowed to vote.

804
00:48:55,232 --> 00:49:01,605
Now that is what's known as being
stunningly and embarrassingly full of shit.

805
00:49:01,672 --> 00:49:05,642
And I think... I think Americans
really show their ignorance

806
00:49:05,709 --> 00:49:08,779
when they say they want
their politicians to be honest.

807
00:49:08,845 --> 00:49:11,581
What are these fucking cretins
talking about?

808
00:49:12,049 --> 00:49:17,854
If honesty were suddenly introduced into
American life, the whole system would collapse!

809
00:49:18,722 --> 00:49:20,257
No one would know what to do!

810
00:49:20,324 --> 00:49:22,526
Honesty would fuck this country up!

811
00:49:23,093 --> 00:49:25,462
And I think deep down,
Americans know that.

812
00:49:25,529 --> 00:49:28,965
That's why they elected
and re-elected Bill Clinton!

813
00:49:29,032 --> 00:49:30,701
That's right.

814
00:49:34,738 --> 00:49:37,541
Because... because the American people

815
00:49:37,607 --> 00:49:39,543
like their bullshit right out front

816
00:49:39,609 --> 00:49:42,045
where they can get
a good strong whiff of it!

817
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:46,183
Clinton might be full of shit,
but at least he lets you know it.

818
00:49:47,084 --> 00:49:48,852
Dolle tried to hide it, didn't he?

819
00:49:48,919 --> 00:49:52,656
Dolle kept saying, "I'm a plain
and honest man!" Bullshit!

820
00:49:53,590 --> 00:49:55,926
People don't believe that!
What did Clinton say?

821
00:49:55,992 --> 00:50:00,063
He said "Hi, folks! I'm completely
full of shit and how do you like that?"

822
00:50:01,264 --> 00:50:04,768
And the people said, "You know
something? At least he's honest."

823
00:50:06,503 --> 00:50:10,307
At least he's honest about
being completely full of shit.

824
00:50:11,174 --> 00:50:13,777
It's just like the business
world, same as business,

825
00:50:13,844 --> 00:50:18,849
everybody knows by now, all
businessmen are completely full of shit,

826
00:50:18,915 --> 00:50:22,252
just the worst kind of low-life,
criminal, cocksuckers,

827
00:50:22,319 --> 00:50:26,390
you could ever want to run into... a
fucking piece of shit businessman.

828
00:50:26,456 --> 00:50:30,260
And the proof of it... the proof of it
is they don't even trust each other!

829
00:50:30,327 --> 00:50:31,762
They don't trust one another!

830
00:50:31,828 --> 00:50:34,364
When a businessman sits down
and negotiates a deal,

831
00:50:34,431 --> 00:50:37,434
the first thing he does is to
automatically assume that the other guy

832
00:50:37,501 --> 00:50:41,505
is a complete lying prick who's
trying to fuck him out of his money!

833
00:50:41,905 --> 00:50:44,441
So, he's gotta do everything
he can to fuck the other guy

834
00:50:44,508 --> 00:50:46,910
a little bit faster and a little bit harder...

835
00:50:47,344 --> 00:50:50,113
and he's gotta do it
with a big smile on his face.

836
00:50:50,547 --> 00:50:53,450
You know that big,
bullshit, businessman smile?

837
00:50:53,517 --> 00:50:58,989
And if you're a customer, whoa,
that's when you get the really big smile!

838
00:50:59,055 --> 00:51:01,491
Customers always get
the really big smile

839
00:51:01,558 --> 00:51:06,663
as the businessman carefully positions
himself directly behind the customer

840
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:11,368
and unzips his pants and
proceeds to service the account!

841
00:51:11,968 --> 00:51:16,740
"I'm servicing this account...
this customer needs service."

842
00:51:18,175 --> 00:51:19,509
Now you know what they mean...

843
00:51:21,278 --> 00:51:25,949
now you know what they mean when they
say, "We specialize in customer service."

844
00:51:27,150 --> 00:51:29,953
Whoever coined the phrase
"let the buyer beware"

845
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:32,989
was probably bleeding from the asshole.

846
00:51:33,056 --> 00:51:35,959
But that's business.

847
00:51:37,494 --> 00:51:38,695
That's business.

848
00:51:41,131 --> 00:51:44,167
But in the bullshit department...
in the bullshit department

849
00:51:44,234 --> 00:51:48,171
a businessman can't
hold a candle to a clergyman...

850
00:51:48,605 --> 00:51:51,508
'cause I gotta tell you the truth,
folks, I gotta tell you the truth.

851
00:51:51,575 --> 00:51:57,380
When it comes to bullshit,
big time, major league bullshit,

852
00:51:57,447 --> 00:52:02,819
you have to stand in awe...
in awe of the all-time champion

853
00:52:02,886 --> 00:52:06,556
of false promises and
exaggerated claims... religion.

854
00:52:06,623 --> 00:52:09,826
No contest! No contest!

855
00:52:11,495 --> 00:52:17,801
Religion... religion easily has
the greatest bullshit story ever told.

856
00:52:18,301 --> 00:52:24,875
Think about it... religion has actually
convinced people that there's an invisible man

857
00:52:25,909 --> 00:52:31,548
living in the sky who watches everything
you do, every minute of every day,

858
00:52:31,615 --> 00:52:36,920
and the invisible man has a special list
of ten things he does not want you to do!

859
00:52:37,721 --> 00:52:41,358
And if you do any of these ten
things, he has a special place

860
00:52:41,424 --> 00:52:45,028
full of fire and smoke and
burning and torture and anguish

861
00:52:45,095 --> 00:52:48,999
where he will send you to live and
suffer and burn and choke and scream

862
00:52:49,065 --> 00:52:53,003
and cry forever and ever
till the end of time...

863
00:52:53,803 --> 00:52:55,171
but he loves you.

864
00:53:02,045 --> 00:53:03,146
He loves you...

865
00:53:06,483 --> 00:53:09,619
he loves you and he needs money!

866
00:53:11,221 --> 00:53:13,356
He always needs money!

867
00:53:13,857 --> 00:53:17,327
He's all-powerful, all-perfect,
all-knowing, and all-wise, somehow...

868
00:53:17,394 --> 00:53:19,696
...just can't handle money!

869
00:53:21,665 --> 00:53:26,570
Religion takes in billions
of dollars, they pay no taxes,

870
00:53:26,636 --> 00:53:28,905
and they always need a little more.

871
00:53:28,972 --> 00:53:34,611
Now, you talk about a
good bullshit story... holy shit!

872
00:53:38,448 --> 00:53:39,448
Thank you!

873
00:53:42,419 --> 00:53:45,956
Thank you. But... Thank you,
thank you, thank you.

874
00:53:46,356 --> 00:53:47,457
Thank you very much.

875
00:53:49,025 --> 00:53:52,729
But I want you to know... I want
you to know something, this is sincere,

876
00:53:52,796 --> 00:53:57,367
I want you to know when it comes
to believing in God, I really tried,

877
00:53:57,434 --> 00:53:59,703
I really, really tried.

878
00:53:59,769 --> 00:54:04,140
I tried to believe that there is a God who
created each of us in his own image and likeness,

879
00:54:04,207 --> 00:54:08,979
loves us very much, and keeps a close eye
on things, I really tried to believe that,

880
00:54:09,045 --> 00:54:12,549
but I gotta tell you, the longer
you live, the more you look around,

881
00:54:12,616 --> 00:54:15,685
the more you realize
something is fucked up.

882
00:54:16,353 --> 00:54:21,358
Something is wrong here... war,
disease, death, destruction, hunger, filth,

883
00:54:21,424 --> 00:54:24,995
poverty, torture, crime,
corruption, and the Ice Capades.

884
00:54:26,463 --> 00:54:28,632
Something is definitely wrong.

885
00:54:28,698 --> 00:54:30,533
This is not good work.

886
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:33,937
If this is the best God can do,
I am not impressed.

887
00:54:34,004 --> 00:54:37,507
Results like these do not belong
on the résumé of a supreme being.

888
00:54:38,274 --> 00:54:41,878
This is the kind of shit you'd expect
from an office temp with a bad attitude.

889
00:54:43,747 --> 00:54:48,084
And just between you and me... between
you and me, in any decently run universe,

890
00:54:48,151 --> 00:54:51,788
this guy would have been out on
his all-powerful ass a long time ago.

891
00:54:52,489 --> 00:54:57,027
And by the way, I say "this guy" because
I firmly believe, looking at these results,

892
00:54:57,093 --> 00:54:59,896
that if there is a God, it has to be a man,

893
00:54:59,963 --> 00:55:03,700
no woman could or would
ever fuck things up like this!

894
00:55:04,300 --> 00:55:06,569
So... so...

895
00:55:08,004 --> 00:55:10,040
...if... if...

896
00:55:10,740 --> 00:55:14,811
if there is a God, if there is,
I think most reasonable people

897
00:55:14,878 --> 00:55:20,984
might agree that he's at least incompetent
and maybe, just maybe, doesn't give a shit.

898
00:55:21,718 --> 00:55:24,387
Doesn't give a shit...
which I admire in a person

899
00:55:24,454 --> 00:55:26,956
and which would explain
a lot of these bad results.

900
00:55:27,323 --> 00:55:32,462
So, rather than be just another mindless
religious robot mindlessly and aimlessly

901
00:55:32,529 --> 00:55:35,198
and blindly believing
that all of this is in the hands

902
00:55:35,265 --> 00:55:38,768
of some spooky, incompetent
father figure who doesn't give a shit,

903
00:55:38,835 --> 00:55:42,038
I decided to look around
for something else to worship,

904
00:55:42,105 --> 00:55:46,710
something I can really count on,
and immediately, I thought of the sun.

905
00:55:46,776 --> 00:55:50,847
Happened like that, overnight,
I became a sun worshiper.

906
00:55:51,448 --> 00:55:53,683
Well, not overnight,
you can't see the sun at night,

907
00:55:54,918 --> 00:56:00,757
the first thing the next morning,
I became a sun worshiper.

908
00:56:01,091 --> 00:56:05,161
Several reasons... first of
all, I can see the sun, okay?

909
00:56:07,497 --> 00:56:12,368
Yeah. Unlike some other Gods I
could mention, I can actually see the sun.

910
00:56:12,435 --> 00:56:15,305
I'm big on that, if I can
see something, I don't know,

911
00:56:15,371 --> 00:56:17,540
kinda helps
the credibility along, you know?

912
00:56:18,241 --> 00:56:22,378
So every day, I can see the sun
as it gives me everything I need:

913
00:56:22,445 --> 00:56:26,416
heat, light, food, flowers in the
park, reflections on the lake...

914
00:56:26,783 --> 00:56:31,521
and occasional skin cancer, but,
hey, at least there are no crucifixions

915
00:56:31,558 --> 00:56:32,998
and we're not setting people on fire

916
00:56:33,022 --> 00:56:34,858
simply because they don't agree with us.

917
00:56:35,692 --> 00:56:37,927
Sun worship is fairly simple.

918
00:56:37,994 --> 00:56:41,064
There's no mystery, no miracles,
no pageantry, no one asks for money,

919
00:56:41,131 --> 00:56:44,000
there are no songs to learn, and
we don't have a special building

920
00:56:44,067 --> 00:56:47,103
where we all gather once a week
to compare clothing.

921
00:56:48,505 --> 00:56:53,777
And the best thing... the best thing about
the sun, it never tells me I'm unworthy,

922
00:56:53,843 --> 00:56:56,780
doesn't tell me I'm a bad person
who needs to be saved,

923
00:56:56,846 --> 00:57:00,817
hasn't said an unkind word,
treats me fine.

924
00:57:00,884 --> 00:57:05,588
So, I worship the sun, but...
I don't pray to the sun.

925
00:57:05,655 --> 00:57:06,656
You know why?

926
00:57:07,090 --> 00:57:10,160
I wouldn't presume on
our friendship, it's not polite.

927
00:57:10,226 --> 00:57:13,163
I often thought people treat
God rather rudely, don't you?

928
00:57:13,229 --> 00:57:18,001
Asking trillions and trillions of prayers
every day, asking and pleading and begging

929
00:57:18,067 --> 00:57:21,571
for favors, do this, give me that, I
need a new car, want a better job,

930
00:57:21,971 --> 00:57:26,142
and most of this praying takes
place on Sunday... his day off.

931
00:57:27,377 --> 00:57:30,580
It's not nice, and it's no way
to treat a friend.

932
00:57:31,247 --> 00:57:34,484
But people do pray and they pray
for a lot of different things...

933
00:57:34,551 --> 00:57:37,153
you know, your sister needs
an operation on her crotch,

934
00:57:37,921 --> 00:57:41,057
your... your brother was arrested
for defecating in a mall,

935
00:57:42,058 --> 00:57:43,827
but most of all, you'd really like to fuck

936
00:57:43,893 --> 00:57:46,362
that hot little redhead
down at the convenience store...

937
00:57:46,996 --> 00:57:50,033
you know, the one with the eye
patch and the clubbed foot? Huh?

938
00:57:50,967 --> 00:57:53,636
Can you pray for that?
I think you'd have to.

939
00:57:54,404 --> 00:57:57,273
And I say fine,
pray for anything you want,

940
00:57:57,340 --> 00:58:01,277
pray for anything,
but what about the divine plan?

941
00:58:01,344 --> 00:58:02,212
Remember that?

942
00:58:02,278 --> 00:58:04,681
The divine plan... long time ago,

943
00:58:04,747 --> 00:58:07,851
God made a divine plan,
gave it a lot of thought,

944
00:58:07,917 --> 00:58:10,453
decided it was a good plan,
put it into practice,

945
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:12,121
and for billions and billions of years,

946
00:58:12,188 --> 00:58:15,058
the divine plan has been doing just fine,

947
00:58:15,124 --> 00:58:17,760
now you come along
and pray for something.

948
00:58:17,827 --> 00:58:21,564
Well, suppose the thing you want
isn't in God's divine plan.

949
00:58:21,631 --> 00:58:25,401
What do you want him to do?
Change his plan? Just for you?

950
00:58:25,468 --> 00:58:28,238
Doesn't that seem a little
arrogant? It's a divine plan!

951
00:58:28,304 --> 00:58:31,507
What's the use of being God if every
run-down schmuck with a $2 prayer book

952
00:58:31,574 --> 00:58:33,209
can come along and fuck up your plan?

953
00:58:34,377 --> 00:58:36,913
And here's something else,
another problem you might have.

954
00:58:36,980 --> 00:58:40,416
Suppose your prayers aren't
answered, what do you say?

955
00:58:40,483 --> 00:58:43,286
"Well, it's God's will, thy will be done."

956
00:58:43,353 --> 00:58:46,656
Fine, but if it's God's will and he's
gonna do what he wants to anyway,

957
00:58:46,723 --> 00:58:49,125
why the fuck bother praying
in the first place?

958
00:58:49,192 --> 00:58:51,995
- Yeah!
- Seems like a big waste of time to me!

959
00:58:52,495 --> 00:58:56,633
Couldn't you just skip the
praying part and go right to his will?

960
00:58:56,699 --> 00:58:58,301
It's all very confusing.

961
00:58:58,368 --> 00:59:02,071
So, to get around a lot of this,
I decided to worship the sun,

962
00:59:02,138 --> 00:59:04,641
but, as I said, I don't pray to the sun.

963
00:59:04,707 --> 00:59:07,310
You know who I pray to? Joe Pesci.

964
00:59:07,377 --> 00:59:11,347
Joe Pesci. Joe Pesci.

965
00:59:11,414 --> 00:59:14,784
Two reasons... first of all,
I think he's a good actor, okay?

966
00:59:14,851 --> 00:59:16,152
To me, that counts.

967
00:59:16,219 --> 00:59:19,756
Second... he looks like a guy
who can get things done.

968
00:59:20,790 --> 00:59:23,126
Joe Pesci doesn't fuck around.

969
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:25,328
Doesn't fuck around.

970
00:59:26,195 --> 00:59:27,195
In fact...

971
00:59:28,831 --> 00:59:33,703
in fact, Joe Pesci came through on a couple
of things that God was having trouble with.

972
00:59:33,761 --> 00:59:35,281
For years, I asked God to do something

973
00:59:35,305 --> 00:59:37,941
about my noisy neighbor
with the barking dog...

974
00:59:38,007 --> 00:59:41,044
Joe Pesci straightened that
cocksucker out with one visit!

975
00:59:42,111 --> 00:59:45,648
It's amazing what you can
accomplish with a simple baseball bat!

976
00:59:47,116 --> 00:59:52,455
So, I've been praying to Joe for about
a year now, and I noticed something.

977
00:59:52,522 --> 00:59:55,458
I noticed that all the prayers
I used to offer to God

978
00:59:55,525 --> 00:59:58,027
and all the prayers
I now offer to Joe Pesci,

979
00:59:58,094 --> 01:00:01,497
are being answered at about
the same 50 percent rate.

980
01:00:02,198 --> 01:00:03,866
Half the time, I get what I want,

981
01:00:03,933 --> 01:00:07,670
half the time, I don't,
same as God, 50-50,

982
01:00:07,737 --> 01:00:09,973
same as the four-leaf clover
and the horseshoe,

983
01:00:10,039 --> 01:00:13,142
the wishing well, and the rabbit's
foot, same as the mojo man,

984
01:00:13,209 --> 01:00:15,311
same as the voodoo lady
who tells you your fortune

985
01:00:15,378 --> 01:00:17,280
by squeezing the goat's testicles,

986
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:21,651
it's all the same, 50-50,
so just pick your superstition,

987
01:00:21,718 --> 01:00:24,921
sit back, make a wish,
and enjoy yourself.

988
01:00:24,988 --> 01:00:29,859
And for those of you who look to the Bible
for moral lessons and literary qualities,

989
01:00:29,926 --> 01:00:32,261
I might suggest a couple
of other stories for you.

990
01:00:32,328 --> 01:00:35,531
Uh, you might wanna look at "The
Three Little Pigs," that's a good one,

991
01:00:36,065 --> 01:00:38,768
has a nice happy ending,
I'm sure you'll like that.

992
01:00:38,835 --> 01:00:40,403
Then there's "Little Red Riding Hood,"

993
01:00:40,470 --> 01:00:43,106
although it does have that
X-rated part where the Big, Bad Wolf

994
01:00:43,172 --> 01:00:47,610
actually eats the grandmother,
which I didn't care for by the way.

995
01:00:48,077 --> 01:00:51,047
And finally, I've often
always drawn a great deal

996
01:00:51,114 --> 01:00:53,683
of moral comfort from "Humpty Dumpty."

997
01:00:54,317 --> 01:00:57,720
The part I like the best, "All the
king's horses and all the king's men,

998
01:00:57,787 --> 01:01:00,656
couldn't put Humpty Dumpty
back together again."

999
01:01:00,723 --> 01:01:04,394
That's because there is no
Humpty Dumpty and there is no God,

1000
01:01:04,460 --> 01:01:07,930
none, not one, no God, never was.

1001
01:01:07,997 --> 01:01:12,869
In fact, I'm gonna... I'm gonna
put it this way... if there is a God...

1002
01:01:12,935 --> 01:01:17,340
if there is a God, may he strike
this audience dead!

1003
01:01:17,407 --> 01:01:20,476
See? Nothing happened!

1004
01:01:20,843 --> 01:01:24,080
Nothing happened!
Everybody's okay! All right?

1005
01:01:24,147 --> 01:01:29,218
Tell you what... tell you what,
I'll raise the stakes.

1006
01:01:29,245 --> 01:01:30,645
I'll raise the stakes a little bit.

1007
01:01:30,669 --> 01:01:34,272
If there is a God, may he strike me dead!

1008
01:01:34,657 --> 01:01:36,259
See? Nothing happened... Oh, wait...

1009
01:01:36,325 --> 01:01:39,996
Got a little cramp in my leg...
and my balls hurt...

1010
01:01:41,030 --> 01:01:43,466
plus, I'm blind... I'm bli...

1011
01:01:43,533 --> 01:01:46,769
Oh, now I'm okay again...
must've been Joe Pesci, huh?

1012
01:01:47,270 --> 01:01:50,873
God bless Joe Pesci! Thank
you all very much! Joe bless you!

1013
01:01:50,940 --> 01:01:53,209
Thank you very much! I appreciate it!

1014
01:02:03,186 --> 01:02:06,189
Bye-bye! Have fun! Good!

1015
01:02:17,100 --> 01:02:21,104
Thank you very much! Have a good
time! Have a good time! Thank you!

1016
01:02:23,639 --> 01:02:24,639
Good-bye!
