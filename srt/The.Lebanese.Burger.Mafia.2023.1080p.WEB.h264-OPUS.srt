it's Lebanese dominated?

180
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:32,160
It was owned by maybe two,
three brothers

181
00:08:32,194 --> 00:08:33,894
and some cousins

182
00:08:33,927 --> 00:08:37,960
or friends opening their own
in different towns.

183
00:08:37,994 --> 00:08:41,994
And that's how
it's turned to be all Lebanese.

184
00:08:42,095 --> 00:08:43,494
OMAR: Kelly's not wrong.

185
00:08:43,527 --> 00:08:45,560
It did start with two
or three brothers,

186
00:08:45,594 --> 00:08:47,760
and some cousins,
or some friends.

187
00:08:47,794 --> 00:08:49,927
And they were immigrants,
just not Lebanese.

188
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,161
They were Americans.

189
00:08:51,195 --> 00:08:53,660
Irish-Americans,
named the McDonnells.

190
00:08:53,694 --> 00:08:55,328
That's McDonnell.

191
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,261
TERRY: My name
is Terry McDonnell.

192
00:08:59,295 --> 00:09:01,860
I'm the son of Jack McDonnell

193
00:09:01,894 --> 00:09:04,328
who started the Burger Baron
in Canada.

194
00:09:04,361 --> 00:09:08,927
I've heard different stories
about "They've started it."

195
00:09:09,661 --> 00:09:11,395
It infuriates me.

196
00:09:12,428 --> 00:09:13,994
It's just not true.

197
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:16,361
It's not even close to it.

198
00:09:16,395 --> 00:09:19,728
It's just an out-and-out lie,
and I don't like it.

199
00:09:19,761 --> 00:09:23,695
That's not the case.
My dad started that. Period.

200
00:09:23,728 --> 00:09:25,628
He had a lot
of different businesses

201
00:09:25,661 --> 00:09:26,695
over the years.

202
00:09:26,728 --> 00:09:28,695
When I was very little,

203
00:09:28,728 --> 00:09:30,728
the family went up to Alaska,

204
00:09:30,761 --> 00:09:33,561
and he was building homes
for the government.

205
00:09:33,595 --> 00:09:36,529
He had a lumber yard
in Great Falls.

206
00:09:36,562 --> 00:09:38,995
He was always on a new idea.

207
00:09:39,096 --> 00:09:42,129
There was a place
in Great Falls, Montana,

208
00:09:42,162 --> 00:09:43,861
called the Burger Master.

209
00:09:43,895 --> 00:09:48,096
It was my dad's inspiration.

210
00:09:48,096 --> 00:09:50,129
And he went
and talked to them about it.

211
00:09:50,162 --> 00:09:52,329
He said, "I want to do
something in Canada.

212
00:09:52,362 --> 00:09:54,096
"Would you guys show me
how to do this?"

213
00:09:54,096 --> 00:09:56,129
He spent a couple
of weeks with them

214
00:09:56,162 --> 00:09:57,429
and just learning the ropes,

215
00:09:57,462 --> 00:10:00,029
and then decided
to move from there to Calgary.

216
00:10:01,729 --> 00:10:04,629
JUDY: The fast food era
goes back a long way.

217
00:10:04,662 --> 00:10:08,330
It was when the car
became important.

218
00:10:08,363 --> 00:10:10,696
Not just one car
in the family, either,

219
00:10:10,729 --> 00:10:13,297
but two cars, more cars.

220
00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:16,962
That's what drove
the fast food era.

221
00:10:16,996 --> 00:10:18,729
It was easy.

222
00:10:18,762 --> 00:10:22,862
It was relatively inexpensive
to get burgers for everybody,

223
00:10:22,896 --> 00:10:24,630
and everybody could find
what they wanted.

224
00:10:24,663 --> 00:10:28,297
I mean, find me a child
that doesn't like French fries.

225
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:31,630
We all love French fries.
And burgers.

226
00:10:31,663 --> 00:10:34,963
OMAR: By 1957,
a new McDonald's was opening

227
00:10:34,997 --> 00:10:36,830
every two weeks in America,

228
00:10:36,863 --> 00:10:39,730
more than tripling
from just the previous year.

229
00:10:39,763 --> 00:10:42,298
On track to have
100 golden arches up

230
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:43,630
by the end of the decade,

231
00:10:43,663 --> 00:10:44,997
Jack saw an opportunity

232
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:47,030
to build the McDonald's
of the north.

233
00:10:47,064 --> 00:10:51,464
There weren't a lot
of fast foods up there, then.

234
00:10:51,498 --> 00:10:53,697
When he first built
the Burger Baron in Calgary,

235
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:55,231
the first one,

236
00:10:55,264 --> 00:10:57,797
he went to a sign company
and said, "I've got this place,

237
00:10:57,830 --> 00:11:00,364
"the Burger Baron,
and I'm gonna need signs."

238
00:11:00,398 --> 00:11:01,531
And the guy said,

239
00:11:01,564 --> 00:11:03,598
"Well, do want me
to design one for you?"

240
00:11:03,631 --> 00:11:06,098
And Dad said,
"Yeah, by all means."

241
00:11:06,098 --> 00:11:08,364
So he then drew up the Baron,

242
00:11:08,398 --> 00:11:12,464
the little fat guy, colorful,
smiley-faced Baron,

243
00:11:12,498 --> 00:11:14,298
and stuck with it.

244
00:11:14,331 --> 00:11:17,099
OMAR: Jack was so confident
that he had the next McDonald's

245
00:11:17,099 --> 00:11:19,631
that he simultaneously
built a second location

246
00:11:19,664 --> 00:11:21,898
200 kilometers away
in Lethbridge

247
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:24,931
and brought his brother Mandy
up from Montana to run it.

248
00:11:24,964 --> 00:11:26,931
They opened them
on the same day.

249
00:11:26,964 --> 00:11:29,564
TERRY: They had a five
or six-speaker system.

250
00:11:29,598 --> 00:11:30,931
(WOMAN OVER PA SYSTEM)
May I take your order?

251
00:11:30,964 --> 00:11:32,265
And then, past that,

252
00:11:32,299 --> 00:11:36,099
was another six
or seven capacity

253
00:11:36,132 --> 00:11:37,632
in the lineup for cars.

254
00:11:37,665 --> 00:11:41,099
It would have been two
or three-blocks-long, at least,

255
00:11:41,099 --> 00:11:42,765
until they closed at midnight.

256
00:11:42,799 --> 00:11:43,932
It was neat to know

257
00:11:43,964 --> 00:11:45,932
that this was happening
to our family,

258
00:11:47,099 --> 00:11:49,365
this, uh, big success.

259
00:11:49,399 --> 00:11:51,265
OMAR: Jack invited
more relatives up

260
00:11:51,299 --> 00:11:53,100
to run his burger joints.

261
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:54,732
And when he ran out
of family members

262
00:11:54,765 --> 00:11:56,265
to go into business with him,

263
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:58,200
he took his next big step.

264
00:11:58,233 --> 00:12:00,699
TERRY: The financial statements
were so strong,

265
00:12:00,732 --> 00:12:03,366
it was just easy
to sell franchises.

266
00:12:04,532 --> 00:12:06,699
In the '50s and '60s,
it really was.

267
00:12:06,732 --> 00:12:08,699
Everybody knew the Burger Baron.

268
00:12:08,732 --> 00:12:10,333
-(STADIUM NOISES)
-OMAR: It was a phenomenon

269
00:12:10,366 --> 00:12:12,366
with its own championship
baseball team,

270
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:15,200
race team,
beauty pageant contestant

271
00:12:15,233 --> 00:12:17,200
-and quite possibly...
-(WHISTLE)

272
00:12:17,233 --> 00:12:19,666
...the world's biggest burger
on order.

273
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:23,166
TERRY: The sauce,
that was one of the secrets.

274
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,966
He didn't give it out
to anybody,

275
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,900
not even the franchisees.

276
00:12:30,233 --> 00:12:32,866
They would supply
each of the restaurants

277
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:34,366
with the Baron sauce,

278
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,700
and so the recipe
wasn't on the can.

279
00:12:38,101 --> 00:12:39,833
OMAR: With McDonald's
still a decade away

280
00:12:39,866 --> 00:12:41,367
from opening in Canada,

281
00:12:41,401 --> 00:12:42,800
Burger Baron might have been

282
00:12:42,833 --> 00:12:45,234
the fastest-growing
restaurant chain in the country.

283
00:12:46,134 --> 00:12:47,334
In just over three years,

284
00:12:47,367 --> 00:12:48,966
it grew to have 30 locations

285
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
in six provinces and two states.

286
00:12:52,634 --> 00:12:54,267
But not everyone wanted
a Burger Baron

287
00:12:54,301 --> 00:12:55,334
in their backyard.

288
00:13:00,367 --> 00:13:01,667
MAN 1: We'd hang around there

289
00:13:01,701 --> 00:13:03,101
and see if we could meet ladies,

290
00:13:03,101 --> 00:13:04,501
or there'd likely to be a fight

291
00:13:04,534 --> 00:13:06,167
or something
you could watch or get in, so...

292
00:13:06,201 --> 00:13:08,367
We had an opportunity
to meet The Who

293
00:13:08,401 --> 00:13:09,601
when they were on a tour.

294
00:13:09,634 --> 00:13:12,168
And we wound up taking
Keith Moon

295
00:13:12,202 --> 00:13:14,367
and the road manager of The Who

296
00:13:14,401 --> 00:13:15,767
out to the Burger Baron.

297
00:13:15,801 --> 00:13:18,168
We were kind of
long-haired hippies

298
00:13:18,202 --> 00:13:19,402
and these two carloads

299
00:13:19,435 --> 00:13:22,102
of what we called "Grease-balls"
came in,

300
00:13:22,102 --> 00:13:24,335
and for some reason,
Keith Moon wanted

301
00:13:24,368 --> 00:13:25,402
to go pick a fight

302
00:13:25,435 --> 00:13:27,502
with these two
(LAUGHING) carloads

303
00:13:27,535 --> 00:13:29,834
full of these local guys.

304
00:13:29,867 --> 00:13:32,901
"This is not a good idea."
(LAUGHING)

305
00:13:32,934 --> 00:13:34,235
Maybe in England,

306
00:13:34,268 --> 00:13:35,934
but if we try that,
we're gonna get stomped out.

307
00:13:35,967 --> 00:13:37,402
(LAUGHS)

308
00:13:37,435 --> 00:13:39,702
OMAR: Whether it was litter
or toxic masculinity,

309
00:13:39,735 --> 00:13:42,368
people were quick to forget
about all that riff-raff

310
00:13:42,402 --> 00:13:44,502
once they had a taste
of Jack McDonnell's

311
00:13:44,535 --> 00:13:46,902
secret Mushroom Burger
and sauce.

312
00:13:46,935 --> 00:13:50,735
The company introduced it
on Valentine's Day, 1961,

313
00:13:50,768 --> 00:13:53,103
and it was love at first sight.

314
00:13:53,103 --> 00:13:55,935
JUDY: The first time I wrote
about Burger Baron,

315
00:13:55,968 --> 00:13:58,103
I had been given an assignment

316
00:13:58,103 --> 00:14:02,236
to go out and gather up
three or five burgers,

317
00:14:02,269 --> 00:14:03,436
bring them back to the Journal,

318
00:14:03,469 --> 00:14:05,503
and we would test them
for quality.

319
00:14:05,536 --> 00:14:07,603
So off I went
in my little Ford Pinto.

320
00:14:07,636 --> 00:14:09,469
I would have had
maybe a McDonald's burger,

321
00:14:09,503 --> 00:14:10,968
likely an A&W,

322
00:14:11,002 --> 00:14:13,469
and I needed one more.

323
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:17,103
So, whatever burger joint
I drive past, that's it.

324
00:14:17,103 --> 00:14:19,669
It happened to be
a Burger Baron.

325
00:14:19,703 --> 00:14:23,104
And I sailed in
and ordered the Mushroom Burger,

326
00:14:23,104 --> 00:14:25,269
and the Mushroom Burger
won, hands down.

327
00:14:25,303 --> 00:14:28,503
I have to say, it was the sauce.

328
00:14:28,536 --> 00:14:31,503
That mushroom sauce
is important.

329
00:14:31,536 --> 00:14:33,803
It's iconic.

330
00:14:33,836 --> 00:14:35,903
First time I tasted
that mushroom sauce,

331
00:14:35,936 --> 00:14:37,969
I was eight years old again,

332
00:14:38,003 --> 00:14:39,470
back in my mom's kitchen,

333
00:14:39,504 --> 00:14:42,337
and I can see her opening
that can of mushroom soup.

334
00:14:54,003 --> 00:14:55,937
I'm mad for these
Mushroom Burgers.

335
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:04,737
TERRY: My father made mistakes,

336
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:06,804
and some were big ones.

337
00:15:06,837 --> 00:15:09,338
Number one, moving way too fast.

338
00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:11,537
Number two, training staff.

339
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:15,471
He didn't train
the new franchisees well enough,

340
00:15:15,504 --> 00:15:17,804
and the franchisees

341
00:15:17,837 --> 00:15:20,637
didn't train their staff
well enough.

342
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:23,138
And that was a big problem.

343
00:15:23,171 --> 00:15:26,904
There is a company
that we call a franchisor.

344
00:15:26,937 --> 00:15:30,371
So they're the ones
who have the secret processes

345
00:15:30,405 --> 00:15:32,571
or the trademark
or what have you.

346
00:15:32,605 --> 00:15:37,305
And they sell the rights
to use those to a franchisee.

347
00:15:37,338 --> 00:15:40,238
And the franchisee
then gets to use

348
00:15:40,271 --> 00:15:41,571
the secret processes.

349
00:15:41,605 --> 00:15:44,638
Maybe it's the secret
Mushroom Burger recipe,

350
00:15:44,671 --> 00:15:46,405
they get to use the logo.

351
00:15:46,438 --> 00:15:47,638
And in exchange for that,

352
00:15:47,671 --> 00:15:50,871
they have to pay
either a regular fee

353
00:15:50,905 --> 00:15:53,406
or usually part of their profits
to the franchisor.

354
00:15:53,439 --> 00:15:56,306
And they also have to maintain
certain standards.

355
00:15:56,339 --> 00:15:58,372
The restaurants
weren't run properly.

356
00:15:58,406 --> 00:16:01,572
The franchisees
would add menu items.

357
00:16:01,606 --> 00:16:05,971
Then you get a lot of menu items
and then the speed goes down.

358
00:16:06,005 --> 00:16:07,706
Quality isn't the same.

359
00:16:07,739 --> 00:16:09,906
OMAR: Jack had lost focus
on the two things

360
00:16:09,938 --> 00:16:11,906
that made it
an immediate success.

361
00:16:11,939 --> 00:16:14,306
Good food and fast service.

362
00:16:14,339 --> 00:16:16,806
He invested all his energy
into the brand,

363
00:16:16,839 --> 00:16:19,572
co-signing on expansions
in major cities

364
00:16:19,606 --> 00:16:22,706
with franchisees who couldn't
afford it on their own.

365
00:16:22,739 --> 00:16:24,972
All because he wanted
to beat the other big chains

366
00:16:25,006 --> 00:16:26,307
to the punch.

367
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:28,939
Betting on making Burger Baron
a household name,

368
00:16:28,972 --> 00:16:32,407
Jack put his last chips
on two Montreal locations.

369
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,639
And when they went down,

370
00:16:33,672 --> 00:16:35,906
Jack was on the hook
with creditors.

ANNA: The Burger Baron companies

372
00:16:37,906 --> 00:16:40,273
had gone through
a bankruptcy process

373
00:16:40,307 --> 00:16:42,407
and voluntary liquidation
under the Companies Act.

374
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:45,807
TERRY: I don't remember
any legal matters.

375
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,607
When they divorced,

376
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:50,707
Mom and my sister and I
moved to Lethbridge.

377
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:53,407
So, I assume that's when
it was all starting.

378
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:56,273
Maybe he was embarrassed
or ashamed.

379
00:16:56,307 --> 00:16:58,773
You know, everything
was falling down.

380
00:16:58,807 --> 00:17:02,607
With the franchise,
it had intellectual properties

381
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:04,707
such as the little Baron.

382
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:06,773
And the name, of course.

383
00:17:06,807 --> 00:17:09,441
Those are
intellectual properties

384
00:17:09,474 --> 00:17:10,807
that you protect.

385
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:12,940
And without protecting it,

386
00:17:12,973 --> 00:17:14,840
people are gonna try and use it.

387
00:17:14,873 --> 00:17:18,807
You have to sue to enforce
intellectual property.

388
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:22,108
But if the company
that has the right to sue

389
00:17:22,108 --> 00:17:24,774
for trademark infringement,
no longer exists,

390
00:17:24,808 --> 00:17:27,441
and that IP
hasn't been transferred

391
00:17:27,474 --> 00:17:29,174
to some other entity,

392
00:17:29,208 --> 00:17:31,108
then you're in a situation

393
00:17:31,108 --> 00:17:34,008
where everybody can use that IP,

394
00:17:34,109 --> 00:17:36,774
and there's nobody
who is going to be enforcing

395
00:17:36,808 --> 00:17:40,175
their right to exclusive use
of that logo or that name.

396
00:17:40,209 --> 00:17:41,541
In fact, at that point,

397
00:17:41,574 --> 00:17:46,142
Dad gave all of them
the recipe to the sauce,

398
00:17:46,175 --> 00:17:50,841
and he didn't charge 'em
any franchise fees anymore.

399
00:17:51,509 --> 00:17:53,008
Without that recipe,

400
00:17:53,109 --> 00:17:55,509
they'd all've been
in a lot of trouble.

his secret processes

402
00:17:57,575 --> 00:17:59,109
with the other Barons,

403
00:17:59,109 --> 00:18:02,109
he'd given them legal permission
to keep the brand alive.

405
00:18:04,442 --> 00:18:06,442

Burger King and Wendy's

406
00:18:06,475 --> 00:18:08,942
prepared aggressive
expansions into Canada,

407
00:18:08,975 --> 00:18:10,275
the writing was on the wall.

408
00:18:11,309 --> 00:18:12,775
The chain couldn't survive

409
00:18:12,809 --> 00:18:15,909
without someone who cared
about it as much as Jack.

410
00:18:15,942 --> 00:18:17,909
It needed a white knight
in shining armor,

411
00:18:17,942 --> 00:18:19,809
but it got
a brown knight instead.

who'd migrated
decades earlier in the 1920s,

432

following thousands

living as homesteaders,
fur traders

and, most of all, peddlers.

436
00:20:07,545 --> 00:20:11,845
They had small carts
drawn by horses.

437
00:20:11,878 --> 00:20:14,246
They were selling
different kinds

oldest Arab communities today.

452
00:20:50,046 --> 00:20:51,979
One of the things
I found really interesting

453
00:20:52,013 --> 00:20:53,280
about Lebanese people

454
00:20:53,314 --> 00:20:55,147
who've been in the province
over 100 years,

455
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:56,480

that not only they,

communities have faced

460
00:21:05,779 --> 00:21:07,879
in terms of providing

461
00:21:07,913 --> 00:21:09,647
for themselves
financially, right?

462
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:13,747
I mean, you look at the history
of restaurants on the prairies,

463
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:17,714
and you see immigrant groups
who have been excluded

464
00:21:17,747 --> 00:21:21,680
from more mainstream routes
to financial success.

"There's nothing

I realized, well, maybe

529
00:24:04,451 --> 00:24:06,319
there's another side
of the story.

530
00:24:07,618 --> 00:24:09,552
My name is Jamal Kemaldean.

531
00:24:09,584 --> 00:24:13,018
I am the son of Rudy Kemaldean,

532
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:14,951
AKA The Godfather.

533
00:24:14,984 --> 00:24:17,185
He always wore a three-piece
suit to the restaurant.

534
00:24:17,219 --> 00:24:19,519
And that had a lot to do

535
00:24:19,552 --> 00:24:21,452
with him growing up
from humble beginnings.

536
00:24:21,485 --> 00:24:23,951
He grew up watching
the big movie stars.

537
00:24:23,984 --> 00:24:26,919
Cary Grant
and Dean Martin, the singer.

538
00:24:26,952 --> 00:24:29,785
They always had nice suits,
cigar, wine.

539
00:24:29,819 --> 00:24:31,385
And that explains
why he likes suits,

540
00:24:31,419 --> 00:24:33,552
cigars and wine so much
these days.

541
00:24:35,452 --> 00:24:36,619
And then he always had
the big cars,

542
00:24:36,652 --> 00:24:38,019
the big Cadillacs

543
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:39,885
with the Continental Kits,
gold-plated trimming

544
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:41,386
all over the place,

545
00:24:41,419 --> 00:24:43,919
and they called my father
The Godfather growing up.

546
00:24:43,952 --> 00:24:45,685
OMAR: And like a true Godfather,

547
00:24:45,719 --> 00:24:47,785
Rudy worked hard
to recruit the right people

548
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:49,420
to help run his empire.

549
00:24:49,453 --> 00:24:52,785
RUDY: That's Fauzi.
The tall, skinny one.

550
00:24:52,819 --> 00:24:55,520
FAUZI: I came here in '69
to go to university.

551
00:24:55,553 --> 00:24:59,253
He had to go to Lebanon
for a few months.

552
00:24:59,286 --> 00:25:01,620
He asked me just to do
very little things

553
00:25:01,653 --> 00:25:03,786
like deposit the money,

554
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:06,486
pay the suppliers and the girls.

555
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:07,920
So I thought to myself,

556
00:25:07,953 --> 00:25:10,020
"I'll work and save some money

557
00:25:10,121 --> 00:25:13,353
"and get back in university."

558
00:25:13,386 --> 00:25:16,353
That didn't happen
because you get a bug

559
00:25:16,386 --> 00:25:18,453
with this kind of business,
you know. You love it.

560
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:23,254
OMAR: The Kemaldean empire

561
00:25:23,287 --> 00:25:26,254
got help from Alberta's
newly discovered oil reserves,

562
00:25:26,287 --> 00:25:28,287
and a wave of Canadians
racing west

563
00:25:28,321 --> 00:25:30,521
to cash in
on a middle-class dream.

564
00:25:30,554 --> 00:25:33,020
But another global event
would soon spread that empire

565
00:25:33,121 --> 00:25:34,953
beyond anyone's imagination.

566
00:25:44,287 --> 00:25:46,487
My name's Nazem Kamaleddine.

567
00:25:46,521 --> 00:25:49,854
I came from Lebanon
back in 1976.

568
00:25:49,887 --> 00:25:51,821
It was a civil war.
We had applied

569
00:25:51,854 --> 00:25:54,521
to come to Canada
just before that broke out,

570
00:25:54,554 --> 00:25:58,288
and then it didn't get approved
until after the war started.

571
00:25:58,322 --> 00:26:01,222
It was my family and my cousin

572
00:26:01,255 --> 00:26:04,821
Khaled Kamaleddine's family.

573
00:26:04,854 --> 00:26:07,155
OMAR: Their uncles, Rudy
and Sal had pitched in

574
00:26:07,188 --> 00:26:08,987
to get all
their immediate relatives

575
00:26:09,021 --> 00:26:10,722
to safety in Canada,

576
00:26:10,754 --> 00:26:12,155
six families in all.

577
00:26:12,188 --> 00:26:13,522
But the danger was highest

578
00:26:13,555 --> 00:26:15,921
for young males
like Nazem and Khaled.

579
00:26:15,954 --> 00:26:18,822
Militants representing
the minority Druze faith

580
00:26:18,855 --> 00:26:21,922
were recruiting teenagers
to help fortify Mount Lebanon

581
00:26:21,955 --> 00:26:23,988
against other
religious factions,

582
00:26:24,022 --> 00:26:26,588
turning them against friends
and neighbors.

583
00:26:26,622 --> 00:26:30,755
Lebanon is divided
by religious groups.

584
00:26:30,788 --> 00:26:34,223
The Maronites, the Sunni Muslims

585
00:26:34,256 --> 00:26:37,356
the Shia Muslims, the Druze.

586
00:26:37,389 --> 00:26:43,523
And the political system tries
to appeal to different groups.

587
00:26:43,556 --> 00:26:46,556
They established
an unwritten constitution,

588
00:26:46,589 --> 00:26:48,523
that the President
of the country

589
00:26:48,556 --> 00:26:50,123
will always be a Maronite,

590
00:26:50,123 --> 00:26:52,523
that the Prime Minister
of the country

591
00:26:52,556 --> 00:26:55,656
will always be
a Sunni Muslim, and so on.

592
00:26:55,689 --> 00:26:58,956
So, whenever you have a system

593
00:27:00,156 --> 00:27:02,589
that is based on religion,

594
00:27:02,623 --> 00:27:04,656
some groups may feel aggrieved.

595
00:27:06,157 --> 00:27:07,556
My best of friends,
they were Christian.

596
00:27:07,589 --> 00:27:09,124
My best friends,
they were Muslim.

597
00:27:09,124 --> 00:27:11,257
We lived together in that area,
you know.

598
00:27:11,290 --> 00:27:13,656
And suddenly, each one
had to disappear.

599
00:27:13,689 --> 00:27:16,889
We lose friends from school,
maybe three or four of them.

600
00:27:16,923 --> 00:27:18,756
I was close friends with you
in school.

601
00:27:18,789 --> 00:27:21,257
They just died
in the war, you know.

602
00:27:21,290 --> 00:27:24,290
Your only way out is the water.

603
00:27:24,324 --> 00:27:27,124
So we had to leave
on a boat to Cyprus.

604

(WAVES SPLASHING)

605
00:27:30,324 --> 00:27:32,557
It was in the evening,
sometimes,

606
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:36,157
and the boat was supposed
to be 100 people, max.

607
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:39,290
But there was over 250
on that boat.

608
00:27:40,424 --> 00:27:43,557
I remember sitting on the deck

609
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:44,990
outside,

610
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:47,657
and water was coming in
from the sea.

611
00:27:49,424 --> 00:27:51,457
-(COAST GUARD SIREN BUZZING)
-We got stopped

612
00:27:51,490 --> 00:27:53,225
by the Israeli boats.

00:27:53,258 --> 00:27:54,924
(COAST GUARD
SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY)

614
00:27:56,158 --> 00:27:57,724
Palestinians were in there,

615
00:27:57,757 --> 00:28:00,325
and they were
just ripping up papers

616
00:28:00,358 --> 00:28:02,790
and throwing them in the sea.

617
00:28:02,824 --> 00:28:05,024
KHALED: After we got
to Cyprus, I said,

618
00:28:05,125 --> 00:28:06,791
"Why are there no bombs here?"
I was young.

619
00:28:06,824 --> 00:28:09,358
I thought to myself
the war was all over the world.

620
00:28:09,391 --> 00:28:11,125
I missed my friends,
I missed my family.

621
00:28:11,125 --> 00:28:13,725
I tried to leave, to go back
to my friends and that,

622
00:28:13,758 --> 00:28:15,525
but somebody, they catch me
and my family

623
00:28:15,558 --> 00:28:16,958
and they got me back.

624
00:28:16,991 --> 00:28:18,391
So they took my passport,
everybody's passport,

625
00:28:18,425 --> 00:28:21,225
and they kept it with them
so you can't go nowhere.

626
00:28:21,258 --> 00:28:23,159
OMAR: More than a dozen
close relatives

627
00:28:23,192 --> 00:28:24,691
awaited them in Cyprus,

628
00:28:24,725 --> 00:28:26,126
along with their uncle Sal,

629
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:28,391
who was helping prepare
the family's exodus.

630
00:28:29,259 --> 00:28:30,392
But they quickly learned

631
00:28:30,426 --> 00:28:31,658
the sectarian conflict

632
00:28:31,691 --> 00:28:33,658
had followed them
across the sea.

633
00:28:33,691 --> 00:28:36,025
Our visa was in
a Canadian embassy,

634
00:28:36,126 --> 00:28:37,825
and the lady was Lebanese,

635
00:28:37,858 --> 00:28:40,192
the one who takes people
in and out.

636
00:28:40,226 --> 00:28:41,426
Christians? Right away, go.

637
00:28:42,492 --> 00:28:43,791
Druze, Muslims?

638
00:28:43,825 --> 00:28:46,126
You're not refugee,
you have to bribe.

639
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:48,826
And we said, "We have no money,
how we can go?"

640
00:28:48,859 --> 00:28:52,826
My uncle went to the embassy
and talked to the council.

641
00:28:52,859 --> 00:28:55,892
If it wasn't for him,
we wouldn't be here.

642
00:28:55,926 --> 00:28:58,026
My father and uncle

643
00:28:58,127 --> 00:29:00,592
brought a lot of people
from overseas,

644
00:29:00,626 --> 00:29:03,127
mostly family, maybe 25 people.

645
00:29:03,127 --> 00:29:06,127
They all stayed at our house

646
00:29:06,127 --> 00:29:08,692
and I really remember
enjoying all the action

647
00:29:08,726 --> 00:29:10,926
and all the parties
he'd have there,

648
00:29:10,959 --> 00:29:12,726
sometimes over 100 people.

649
00:29:12,759 --> 00:29:14,792
With every drink of water,

650
00:29:14,826 --> 00:29:17,859
with every bite of food
you'd eat,

651
00:29:17,892 --> 00:29:21,593
it was always on my mind
how to get back.

652
00:29:21,627 --> 00:29:23,959
My heart was there,

653
00:29:23,992 --> 00:29:25,860
and my mind was there,

654
00:29:25,892 --> 00:29:27,193
but my body wasn't.

655
00:29:27,227 --> 00:29:28,893
I didn't go to school here.

656
00:29:28,927 --> 00:29:30,193
We had to work

657
00:29:30,227 --> 00:29:33,227
and support the family,
support the house.

658
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:36,128
And, of course, Mom and Dad
couldn't speak the language,

659
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:39,128
so we are the main supporters,
me and my brothers.

660
00:29:39,128 --> 00:29:42,261
I've been with Burger Baron
since I was 13 years old.

661
00:29:42,294 --> 00:29:44,261
And I worked with Uncle Sam,

662
00:29:44,294 --> 00:29:48,228
and my brother
used to work with Uncle Rudy.

663
00:29:48,261 --> 00:29:50,860
And then we finished
from one place,

664
00:29:50,893 --> 00:29:52,693
we'd go to close another place.

665
00:29:52,727 --> 00:29:54,428
Everybody was helping everybody.

Every one of them have
a Burger Baron, you know?

667
00:29:57,927 --> 00:29:59,128
If not him, it will be his son.

668
00:29:59,161 --> 00:30:00,728
Or not his son, his daughter.

669
00:30:00,761 --> 00:30:03,594
The Burger Baron gave
lots of opportunities for us.

wasn't just for close relatives.

to anyone who asked,

673
00:30:10,261 --> 00:30:12,428
and encouraged them
to do for their families

674

for his own.

Based on the Kemaldean success,

679
00:31:31,896 --> 00:31:34,296
a suite of Arab-owned diners
had cropped up

under some crafty names

681
00:31:36,663 --> 00:31:38,996

Though, that one
didn't last long

00:31:44,563 --> 00:31:46,131
after the bigger M sued.

BAHA: With Burger Baron,

688
00:32:15,431 --> 00:32:18,864
there was a great deal
of prosperity

689
00:32:18,897 --> 00:32:21,198
that occurred in the community

690
00:32:21,232 --> 00:32:25,365
as a result of selling fast food

691
00:32:25,398 --> 00:32:26,931

692
00:32:26,964 --> 00:32:29,632
and people were needing it
at that time.

00:32:31,432 --> 00:32:35,598
My first restaurant,
I opened in Lebanon,

694
00:32:35,632 --> 00:32:37,165
before I came to Canada.

695
00:32:37,198 --> 00:32:40,132
It was in 1981.

696
00:32:40,132 --> 00:32:41,265
It was Lebanese food.

697
00:32:41,298 --> 00:32:44,132
I ran that place
for only one year

698
00:32:44,132 --> 00:32:49,199
because Israel came
to Lebanon in 1982.

699
00:32:49,233 --> 00:32:52,565
There was a war
where my restaurant is,

700
00:32:52,598 --> 00:32:54,133
and lots of damage.

701
00:32:54,133 --> 00:32:56,498

of Terry's frustration

royalties from.

because of Calgary's history
with the Burger Barons.

"I invented that."

1016
00:47:35,256 --> 00:47:38,356
And he said, "Also,
I started this franchise."

1017
00:47:39,156 --> 00:47:40,888

and as luck would have it,

I found the originator
right away.

1027
00:48:04,157 --> 00:48:05,956
Or so I thought.

1028
00:48:05,989 --> 00:48:08,390
Sal had weaved together
a loose tale

1029
00:48:08,423 --> 00:48:10,922
about co-founding the company
with Jack McDonnell

1030
00:48:10,956 --> 00:48:13,390
and his brother Dick in 1957,

1031
00:48:13,423 --> 00:48:15,689
barely a year
after immigrating to Canada

1032
00:48:15,722 --> 00:48:16,889
as a teenager.

1033
00:48:16,922 --> 00:48:18,789
He told me
he was a silent partner

1034
00:48:18,822 --> 00:48:20,257
who'd come up with the recipes

1035
00:48:20,290 --> 00:48:22,623
in lieu of any
financial investment.

1036
00:48:22,657 --> 00:48:23,956
And his biggest contribution,

1037
00:48:23,989 --> 00:48:26,022
the Mushroom Burger sauce,

1038
00:48:26,056 --> 00:48:29,357
which he claimed was made
with secret Lebanese spices,

1039
00:48:29,390 --> 00:48:31,690

1040
00:48:31,723 --> 00:48:33,623

having told Terry

we invented the Burger Baron

He told me that he was
the Burger Baron.

00:48:49,890 --> 00:48:51,923
And I've also heard
from someone else

00:48:57,957 --> 00:48:59,358
Well, I don't think
that I said...

1053
00:48:59,391 --> 00:49:01,458
-I did that.
-OMAR: Well...

1054
00:49:01,491 --> 00:49:02,923
-You told me...
-Yes.

1055
00:49:02,957 --> 00:49:04,424
...you had started
the Burger Baron.

1056
00:49:04,458 --> 00:49:05,924
I don't know you want me to say.

1057
00:49:05,958 --> 00:49:08,191
So if you want to report that,
go ahead, report it.

1058
00:49:08,224 --> 00:49:09,824
You could report
anything you like.

1059
00:49:10,658 --> 00:49:12,158
OMAR: In fairness to Sal,

1060
00:49:12,191 --> 00:49:13,991
he probably
wasn't the only brother

1061
00:49:14,024 --> 00:49:16,159
pretending to be the inventor.

1062
00:49:16,192 --> 00:49:18,491
There was a photo of you
at the Leduc location

1063
00:49:18,524 --> 00:49:21,958
where it was you
in your kitchen uniform.

1064
00:49:21,991 --> 00:49:23,159
And it said, you know,

1065
00:49:23,159 --> 00:49:26,259
"Rudy Kemaldean,
Burger Baron, 1955,"

1066
00:49:26,292 --> 00:49:29,958
which was years
before Burger Baron launched.

1067
00:49:31,359 --> 00:49:32,359
Yeah.

1068
00:49:37,824 --> 00:49:39,159
Jamal? Jamal.

1069
00:49:39,159 --> 00:49:42,192
-OMAR: Your son?
-My son. Yeah.

1070
00:49:42,225 --> 00:49:44,592
I thought it would look better
to the customers, perhaps,

1071
00:49:44,625 --> 00:49:45,859
to be honest.

1072
00:49:45,892 --> 00:49:49,159
And wanted to make
the Burger Baron name

1073
00:49:49,159 --> 00:49:52,192
that much more interesting,
I guess.

1074
00:49:52,225 --> 00:49:53,859
Did you use to tell people

1075
00:49:53,892 --> 00:49:55,625
that you were
the Burger Baron inventor?

1076
00:49:55,659 --> 00:49:58,359
No, no. I never
even thought of it.

1077
00:49:58,392 --> 00:50:00,360
He claimed,
certainly to my face,

1078
00:50:00,393 --> 00:50:02,825
that he is the originator
of the Burger Baron.

1079
00:50:02,859 --> 00:50:04,025
He's the man.

1080
00:50:04,059 --> 00:50:05,526
He's the guy that came up
with all the stuff

1081
00:50:05,559 --> 00:50:08,825
like the logo and the food
and stuff like that.

1082
00:50:08,859 --> 00:50:10,859
Rudy was
a very convincing individual,

1083
00:50:10,892 --> 00:50:12,859
and he was standing
in his Burger Baron

1084
00:50:12,892 --> 00:50:14,660
surrounded by his children

1085
00:50:14,693 --> 00:50:16,493
telling me his story.

1086
00:50:16,526 --> 00:50:18,660
So I had no reason to doubt him.

1087
00:50:18,693 --> 00:50:21,526
Yeah, I mean, the story
sounds a little better, right?

1088
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:23,160
The Mushroom Burger
tasted a little better

1089
00:50:23,193 --> 00:50:25,760
when you ate it maybe,
if you knew that story.

1090
00:50:25,793 --> 00:50:26,826
(CHUCKLES)

1091
00:50:26,860 --> 00:50:28,793
That was where
our mafia comes in.

1092
00:50:28,826 --> 00:50:30,293
That's about as criminal
as we got.

1093
00:50:31,161 --> 00:50:34,026
So many people came to Rudy

1094
00:50:34,060 --> 00:50:35,326
thinking he was
the Burger Baron,

1095
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:37,194
and they could open
a Burger Baron,

1096
00:50:37,227 --> 00:50:39,026
and Rudy said, "Go ahead."
Whatever the case.

1097
00:50:39,060 --> 00:50:41,493
I used to drive
to various Burger Barons.

1098
00:50:41,526 --> 00:50:44,960
You ask for a Baronet,
heaven knows what you'll get.

1099
00:50:44,993 --> 00:50:48,960
We can't even agree
on our last name's spelling,

1100
00:50:48,993 --> 00:50:51,026
let alone, you know,

1101
00:50:51,060 --> 00:50:52,594
getting everything consistent
like sauces

1102
00:50:52,627 --> 00:50:54,327
and everything else,
so... (CHUCKLES)

1103
00:50:54,361 --> 00:50:56,461
You know, of course
we had our challenges there.

1104
00:50:56,494 --> 00:50:58,127
OMAR: For Terry
and the Kemaldeans,

1105
00:50:58,161 --> 00:51:01,427
the inconsistencies
have tainted the brand name.

1106
00:51:01,461 --> 00:51:03,994
But for the Burger Barons'
stalwart customers,

1107
00:51:04,027 --> 00:51:06,361
the chaos might be
the best part about it.

1108
00:51:09,294 --> 00:51:11,327
MAN 7: The reason
it's so special is the lore,

1109
00:51:11,361 --> 00:51:14,328
the urban legend
that comes along with it.

1110
00:51:14,361 --> 00:51:18,861
It's a chain restaurant
that went wrong,

1111
00:51:18,894 --> 00:51:20,162
and the food is...

1112
00:51:20,162 --> 00:51:22,362
There's no quality control
between them.

1113
00:51:22,395 --> 00:51:25,428
The burgers are spongy.
But I love them.

1114
00:51:25,462 --> 00:51:27,162
What I love
about the Burger Baron

1115
00:51:27,162 --> 00:51:28,894
is it's so mysterious.

1116
00:51:28,927 --> 00:51:31,994
It's funny to imagine
all these burger chains,

1117
00:51:32,027 --> 00:51:34,228
sprawling out from one origin

1118
00:51:34,262 --> 00:51:35,762
and then disputing

1119
00:51:35,795 --> 00:51:37,662
-who the original guy was.
-(LAUGHS)

1120
00:51:37,695 --> 00:51:39,228
-OMAR: Yeah.
-"And the Burger Baron,

1121
00:51:39,262 --> 00:51:40,562
"who is that guy?"

1122
00:51:40,595 --> 00:51:42,928
Any other burger restaurant
that you can go to,

1123
00:51:42,962 --> 00:51:44,228
any franchise or something,

1124
00:51:44,262 --> 00:51:47,495
that magic isn't there,
that personality.

1125
00:51:47,528 --> 00:51:50,028
When I think of other
fast food joints,

1126
00:51:50,062 --> 00:51:51,428
it's all about
reproduction, right?

1127
00:51:51,462 --> 00:51:53,062
Everything has to taste
the same every single time.

1128
00:51:53,163 --> 00:51:54,562
You have your favorite
Burger Baron.

1129
00:51:54,595 --> 00:51:56,163
You don't have
your favorite McDonald's.

1130
00:51:56,163 --> 00:51:59,662
You don't have your favorite
Taco Bell or something, right?

1131
00:51:59,695 --> 00:52:02,463
The Burger Baron
in Redwater makes pizza.

1132
00:52:02,496 --> 00:52:04,062
Do other Burger Barons
have pizza?

1133
00:52:04,163 --> 00:52:08,163
OMAR: Yeah, my parents'
restaurant was big on pizza.

1134
00:52:08,163 --> 00:52:10,062
Maybe sold as many pizzas
as burgers.

1135
00:52:10,163 --> 00:52:12,563
-Wait, your parents had a...
-Yes, I'm the son of a Baron.

1136
00:52:12,596 --> 00:52:14,962
-Holy shit. You're royalty.
-It's not everyday...

1137
00:52:14,995 --> 00:52:17,663
Sometimes when you walk into
a more modern or updated one,

1138
00:52:17,696 --> 00:52:19,596
it's kind of a letdown in a way.

1139
00:52:19,629 --> 00:52:21,929
OMAR: What these superfans
don't realize

1140
00:52:21,963 --> 00:52:23,963
is just how hard
the Barons tried

1141
00:52:23,996 --> 00:52:26,029
to become the very thing
they despise.

1142
00:52:27,929 --> 00:52:29,197
NAZEM: Back in the '80s,

1143
00:52:29,230 --> 00:52:32,596
I invited a whole bunch
of Burger Baron owners

1144
00:52:32,629 --> 00:52:33,829
into Edmonton,

1145
00:52:33,863 --> 00:52:35,796
and we will have
our own suppliers

1146
00:52:35,829 --> 00:52:37,164
mixing our stuff,

1147
00:52:37,197 --> 00:52:39,164
and then I'll have
like a warehouse.

1148
00:52:39,197 --> 00:52:42,330
Everything comes strictly
for the Burger Baron.

1149
00:52:42,364 --> 00:52:47,464
We tried to get everybody
together to agree

1150
00:52:47,497 --> 00:52:50,397
so everybody
will be all the same

1151
00:52:50,430 --> 00:52:52,264
for all of them,
wherever you go.

1152
00:52:52,297 --> 00:52:54,630
OMAR: His uncles Rudy
and Fauzi had twice attempted

1153
00:52:54,664 --> 00:52:56,063
to unify the chain,

1154
00:52:56,164 --> 00:52:57,497
but it never lasted.

1155
00:52:57,530 --> 00:52:59,497
By 1984, the Burger Baron brand

1156
00:52:59,530 --> 00:53:01,464
had been overtaken
and proliferated

1157
00:53:01,497 --> 00:53:03,797
by a handful of Lebanese
immigrant families.

1158
00:53:03,830 --> 00:53:04,897
Thanks to them,

1159
00:53:04,930 --> 00:53:07,030
the empire had never been bigger

1160
00:53:07,064 --> 00:53:08,830
and never more disorganized.

1161
00:53:08,864 --> 00:53:10,331
The civil war brought us

1162
00:53:10,365 --> 00:53:13,064
some of "the unwelcome,"
you might say,

1163
00:53:13,165 --> 00:53:14,231
in the business field.

1164
00:53:14,265 --> 00:53:17,565
They don't have
the first clue about PR

1165
00:53:17,597 --> 00:53:19,198
or being nice to people

1166
00:53:19,231 --> 00:53:23,964
or giving them
what they pay for.

1167
00:53:23,997 --> 00:53:25,531
OMAR: So Nazem stepped up

1168
00:53:25,565 --> 00:53:27,298
and tried to rein in
the Burger Baron

1169
00:53:27,331 --> 00:53:29,030
for the family once again.

1170
00:53:29,064 --> 00:53:32,498
Rudy gave me the okay
to see if I can fix things

1171
00:53:32,531 --> 00:53:33,631
the way I wanted.

1172
00:53:33,665 --> 00:53:36,031
If he could do it better,

1173
00:53:36,065 --> 00:53:37,465
that's good for everybody.

1174
00:53:37,498 --> 00:53:39,498
You know, for me, for him.

1175
00:53:39,531 --> 00:53:41,631
He had no right
to even tell him that.

1176
00:53:41,665 --> 00:53:43,398
He could tell him
he could do anything.

1177
00:53:43,431 --> 00:53:44,698
He can tell him
to go to the moon.

1178
00:53:45,865 --> 00:53:48,031
But there is the problem.

1179
00:53:48,065 --> 00:53:49,498
"No, mine is better."

1180
00:53:49,531 --> 00:53:52,631
I said, "We put
10 different sauces

1181
00:53:52,665 --> 00:53:54,166
"and let a food judge pick."

1182
00:53:54,166 --> 00:53:56,499
But nobody would want to agree.

1183
00:53:56,532 --> 00:53:58,166
You know how the Lebanese way.

1184
00:53:58,166 --> 00:54:00,299
You can't put it
through their heads

1185
00:54:00,332 --> 00:54:05,399
that younger guys have,
sometimes, better ideas.

1186
00:54:05,432 --> 00:54:09,899
Nazem is grandulizing
himself too much.

1187
00:54:11,832 --> 00:54:14,599
NAZEM: I think
they were afraid of things

1188
00:54:14,632 --> 00:54:16,566
that will not go their way.

1189
00:54:17,799 --> 00:54:19,866
After I decided not to do it,

1190
00:54:19,899 --> 00:54:21,366
a few got together,

1191
00:54:21,399 --> 00:54:23,366
and they wanted
to do it themselves.

1192
00:54:23,399 --> 00:54:26,333
That's when I refused
and I wouldn't go with them.

1193
00:54:28,466 --> 00:54:29,599
(JAMIL SPEAKING)

1194
00:54:52,667 --> 00:54:56,168
OMAR: Jamil organized
a Summit of the Barons in 1989.

1195
00:54:56,168 --> 00:54:57,600
And perhaps
because he wasn't part

1196
00:54:57,633 --> 00:54:59,234
of the Kemaldean family,

1197
00:54:59,267 --> 00:55:01,867
he successfully convinced
a dozen or two Barons

1198
00:55:01,900 --> 00:55:04,168
to meet in Edmonton
to hear out his vision,

1199
00:55:04,168 --> 00:55:06,533
including my dad
and Uncle Abdul-Aziz.

1200
00:55:23,668 --> 00:55:25,668
OMAR: By the end of the 1980s,

1201
00:55:25,701 --> 00:55:27,268
small-town diners
like my parents'

1202
00:55:27,301 --> 00:55:29,868
had to contend
with name-brand competition

1203
00:55:29,901 --> 00:55:31,934
that had the advertising
and buying power

1204
00:55:31,968 --> 00:55:34,268
to price out the moms-and-pops.

1205
00:55:34,301 --> 00:55:36,768
The new franchises
couldn't register.

1206
00:55:36,801 --> 00:55:39,334
So it was just
like an association.

1207
00:55:46,568 --> 00:55:48,369
They could not try to unite

1208
00:55:48,402 --> 00:55:52,635
the name
and get everybody together.

1209
00:55:52,669 --> 00:55:54,702
There was so many people,
you know.

1210
00:55:54,734 --> 00:55:57,202
Some of them,
they brought their wives,

1211
00:55:57,235 --> 00:56:00,669
and it's just like a gathering.

1212
00:56:00,702 --> 00:56:02,669
Everybody was excited

1213
00:56:02,702 --> 00:56:04,735
about what, in the end,
it was gonna be.

1214
00:56:06,802 --> 00:56:08,235
They started talking

1215
00:56:08,269 --> 00:56:10,702
about getting
all the buildings the same

1216
00:56:11,769 --> 00:56:13,170
and as soon
as they started talking

1217
00:56:13,203 --> 00:56:14,769
about building the same,

1218
00:56:14,802 --> 00:56:16,735
nobody wanted to be involved.

1219
00:56:16,769 --> 00:56:18,369
Almost everybody
wanted to leave.

1220
00:56:24,303 --> 00:56:27,769
They said, "Okay, well,
don't worry about the building,

1221
00:56:27,802 --> 00:56:30,270
"we're gonna try
to join together

1222
00:56:30,303 --> 00:56:33,336
"at least when we buy
the groceries

1223
00:56:33,370 --> 00:56:35,503
"and the meat from the company."

1224
00:56:35,536 --> 00:56:37,236
MUSTAPHA: And then
after that, he said,

1225
00:56:37,270 --> 00:56:41,002
"If I want
to keep going like that,

1226
00:56:41,035 --> 00:56:42,203
"I need to have wages."

1227
00:56:42,903 --> 00:56:44,236
He's gonna be in charge,

1228
00:56:44,270 --> 00:56:48,436
and he's gonna have
his own office and secretary.

1229
00:56:48,470 --> 00:56:50,403
And everybody started thinking,

1230
00:56:50,436 --> 00:56:54,870
"Hey, this guy is gonna fool us.
No. No." (CHUCKLES)

1231
00:57:07,003 --> 00:57:08,736
You have your own place,

1232
00:57:08,770 --> 00:57:13,171
and now somebody
almost control your business

1233
00:57:13,171 --> 00:57:14,304
and tell you what to do,

1234
00:57:15,171 --> 00:57:16,637
and that's the worst.

1235
00:57:16,671 --> 00:57:18,070
I'm the owner.

1236
00:57:18,171 --> 00:57:20,671
And whatever happens,
it's my decision.

1237
00:57:31,172 --> 00:57:32,804
OMAR: Jamil did manage
to at least get

1238
00:57:32,837 --> 00:57:34,571
that rebate he promised.

1239
00:57:34,604 --> 00:57:37,571
But without any assistance
from his fellow Barons,

1240
00:57:37,604 --> 00:57:39,604
he let it expire after two years

1241
00:57:39,637 --> 00:57:40,937
and then retired for good.

1242
00:57:53,205 --> 00:57:56,505
It was a good idea, you know,

1243
00:57:56,538 --> 00:57:58,472
if we went for it, even.

1244
00:57:58,505 --> 00:58:00,505
I think it'll work,

1245
00:58:00,538 --> 00:58:03,338
just like you have at A&W.

1246
00:58:10,605 --> 00:58:14,339
I would have loved
to see the Burger Baron

1247
00:58:14,373 --> 00:58:17,672
in a lot better way
than it is now.

1248
00:58:17,705 --> 00:58:18,972
OMAR: But this wasn't the end

1249
00:58:19,005 --> 00:58:21,306
of the Burger Barons'
franchising efforts.

1250
00:58:21,339 --> 00:58:23,705
As the old guard
was losing steam,

1251
00:58:23,738 --> 00:58:25,705
a new generation
was making moves.

1252
00:58:30,739 --> 00:58:33,306
We knew that there is
an association or some group

1253
00:58:33,339 --> 00:58:34,373
trying to do the same thing.

1254
00:58:34,406 --> 00:58:36,038
It didn't work.

1255
00:58:36,072 --> 00:58:38,473
So I thought
maybe I'll try my way

1256
00:58:38,506 --> 00:58:40,373
and I called it Burger Baron:
The New Generation.

1257
00:58:40,406 --> 00:58:43,206
I wanted to change
the image of the company.

1258
00:58:43,239 --> 00:58:46,406
So I came up with this idea,
with the Burger Baron logo,

1259
00:58:46,439 --> 00:58:47,639
the New Generation.

1260
00:58:47,673 --> 00:58:49,406
I thought this was
gonna make a new wave.

1261
00:58:49,439 --> 00:58:51,939
At the time, there were 60
Burger Barons.

1262
00:58:52,839 --> 00:58:54,307
So I wanted to unify this

1263
00:58:54,340 --> 00:58:56,873
and put it in one agreement,
and one price for everybody.

1264
00:58:56,906 --> 00:58:58,039
Everybody loves it.

1265
00:58:58,073 --> 00:58:59,507
My cousins, my brothers.

1266
00:58:59,540 --> 00:59:01,574
A lot of people showed interest.

1267
00:59:01,607 --> 00:59:02,973
They showed me the support.

1268
00:59:03,006 --> 00:59:05,474
That's why I spent some money
doing the jingle.

1269
00:59:05,507 --> 00:59:08,607
(JINGLE PLAYING)
* Burger Baron

1270
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:10,540
* We're the hot spot
right here in town... *

1271
00:59:10,574 --> 00:59:12,973
MIKE: They love the jingle,
they want to use it.

1272
00:59:13,006 --> 00:59:14,574
They want to be part of it.

1273
00:59:14,607 --> 00:59:16,940
But when they see
there is an agreement...

1274
00:59:16,974 --> 00:59:19,774
* ...we'll take it back
to the good old days... *

1275
00:59:19,807 --> 00:59:23,740
What I do here
is different than what he does.

1276
00:59:23,774 --> 00:59:25,175
"No, I'm not signing this."

1277
00:59:25,175 --> 00:59:27,175
Even within our family.

1278
00:59:29,940 --> 00:59:31,175
My lawyer advised me

1279
00:59:31,175 --> 00:59:33,740
it's too difficult
to franchise Burger Baron.

1280
00:59:33,774 --> 00:59:35,208
If you want to claim it,
you have to take each

1281
00:59:35,241 --> 00:59:37,707
and every person to court.

1282
00:59:37,740 --> 00:59:40,575
I ended up creating Best Bite.

1283
00:59:40,608 --> 00:59:43,375
So I kept the logo
and changed the name

1284
00:59:43,408 --> 00:59:44,807
from Burger Baron:
The New Generation.

1285
00:59:44,840 --> 00:59:46,475
OMAR: How's that going?

1286
00:59:46,508 --> 00:59:48,441
So far, this is
the first location.

1287
00:59:48,475 --> 00:59:50,241
OMAR: No one has ever paid

1288
00:59:50,275 --> 00:59:52,441
-to use the Best Bite?
-Not yet.

1289
00:59:52,475 --> 00:59:54,375
OMAR: What about
your family members?

1290
00:59:54,408 --> 00:59:57,175
They like the logo,
they took the logo, they use it.

1291
00:59:57,175 --> 00:59:58,875
Maybe it's temporary or not,

1292
00:59:58,908 --> 01:00:00,241
but that's what I'm using
right now.

1293
01:00:00,275 --> 01:00:01,808
Every Lebanese guy is like that.

1294
01:00:01,841 --> 01:00:03,608
Maybe that's our brain
like that. I don't know.

1295
01:00:03,641 --> 01:00:05,708
I think it's a cultural thing

1296
01:00:05,741 --> 01:00:08,276
that we have
such a strong independence

1297
01:00:09,108 --> 01:00:11,941
that a franchise system

1298
01:00:11,975 --> 01:00:13,975
doesn't really work well
with us.

1299
01:00:16,409 --> 01:00:18,741
OMAR: This fierce independence
has a dark side

1300
01:00:18,775 --> 01:00:21,041
apparent in Lebanon itself.

1301
01:00:21,075 --> 01:00:25,041
It's this chronic disunity
that pit party against party,

1302
01:00:25,075 --> 01:00:28,409
religion against religion,
and citizen against citizen.

1303
01:00:30,476 --> 01:00:33,209
Though the civil war ended
more than 30 years ago,

1304
01:00:33,242 --> 01:00:34,809
the tyranny of incompetence

1305
01:00:34,842 --> 01:00:36,276
spread through every part
of Lebanon

1306
01:00:36,309 --> 01:00:38,742
from hyperinflation
to basic services

1307
01:00:38,776 --> 01:00:42,277
like garbage collection,
electricity and health care.

1308
01:00:46,942 --> 01:00:49,676
It is, by all measures,
a failed state.

1309
01:00:55,443 --> 01:00:57,543
RUDY: I am always excited
to be here.

1310
01:00:57,577 --> 01:00:59,942
It's a beautiful country,
beautiful villages,

1311
01:00:59,976 --> 01:01:02,177
beautiful mountains.

1312
01:01:02,210 --> 01:01:05,843
But with Corona for two years,
we stayed home.

1313
01:01:05,877 --> 01:01:08,443
And the situation
and politicians

1314
01:01:08,477 --> 01:01:09,977
in Lebanon is bad.

1315
01:01:10,010 --> 01:01:12,977
We will see what is going
to happen if all is settled

1316
01:01:13,010 --> 01:01:15,510
and we'll be glad to be here.

1317
01:01:15,543 --> 01:01:18,310
Otherwise, I'll be in Canada,
I'll stay there.

1318
01:01:22,843 --> 01:01:24,843
Boy, there's a lot
of clothes in this.

1319
01:01:28,244 --> 01:01:31,943
We do like to go
on holidays and rest

1320
01:01:31,977 --> 01:01:35,544
because I spend lots of time
with the Burger Barons,

1321
01:01:35,578 --> 01:01:37,611
working 18 hours a day,

1322
01:01:37,644 --> 01:01:41,578
every day, every week,
and you don't go anywhere.

1323
01:01:42,311 --> 01:01:44,178
Just a big prison.

1324
01:01:44,178 --> 01:01:46,178
About 15 years ago,

1325
01:01:46,178 --> 01:01:48,244
we started coming to Lebanon

1326
01:01:49,178 --> 01:01:50,811
four or five months here,

1327
01:01:50,844 --> 01:01:54,544
and four or five,
the rest, in Canada.

1328
01:01:54,578 --> 01:01:57,044
There used to be
a Burger Baron in Aley.

1329
01:01:57,078 --> 01:01:58,478
We used to go there.

1330
01:01:58,511 --> 01:02:04,179
And it's very good food
and we used to enjoy it.

1331
01:02:04,179 --> 01:02:07,245
All of a sudden,
when we came back this year,

1332
01:02:07,279 --> 01:02:08,878
it closed down.

1333
01:02:08,911 --> 01:02:11,445
It looks like something else,
like a butcher shop inside.

1334
01:02:11,479 --> 01:02:12,711
They still got the same,

1335
01:02:12,744 --> 01:02:14,911
the Burger Baron sign, in there.

1336
01:02:16,878 --> 01:02:19,612
OMAR: Rudy
officially retired in 2015.

1337
01:02:19,645 --> 01:02:23,044
But he gave up on being
the Godfather long ago,

1338
01:02:23,078 --> 01:02:25,912
with some hard-earned lessons
about loyalty and trust.

1339
01:02:26,979 --> 01:02:29,412
Most of the time,
they lose their business

1340
01:02:29,445 --> 01:02:32,180
because they never
look after it.

1341
01:02:34,045 --> 01:02:35,412
They go have a good time

1342
01:02:35,445 --> 01:02:38,079
and I get stuck
looking after it,

1343
01:02:38,180 --> 01:02:39,879
everyone I helped.

1344
01:02:39,912 --> 01:02:44,280
They put the blame on me
if they didn't make money.

1345
01:02:44,313 --> 01:02:47,280
So that's why, now,

1346
01:02:47,313 --> 01:02:49,912
even at that time,
they went on their own

1347
01:02:49,945 --> 01:02:51,680
and I was on my own.

1348
01:02:51,712 --> 01:02:54,045
Not involved with any
of my cousins

1349
01:02:54,079 --> 01:02:57,780
or brothers or anything.

1350
01:02:57,813 --> 01:03:02,480
My father, he's a very
generous, giving man

1351
01:03:02,513 --> 01:03:05,913
but that also opens doors
to, you know,

1352
01:03:05,946 --> 01:03:07,446
sometimes being
taken advantage of.

1353
01:03:08,546 --> 01:03:09,680
And unfortunately,

1354
01:03:09,713 --> 01:03:12,313
I saw quite a bit
of that as well.

1355
01:03:12,346 --> 01:03:14,413
We were having a hard time
back in the '80s.

1356
01:03:14,446 --> 01:03:16,247
He had lost a motel
he used to own.

1357
01:03:16,281 --> 01:03:17,813
He was spread too thin.

1358
01:03:17,846 --> 01:03:19,281
So without getting
into too much detail,

1359
01:03:19,314 --> 01:03:21,980
let's just say
if the Kemaldean family

1360
01:03:22,013 --> 01:03:24,247
worked as close together

1361
01:03:24,281 --> 01:03:26,846
as I wish they would have,

1362
01:03:28,181 --> 01:03:30,281
they'd probably
be billionaires right now.

1363
01:03:30,314 --> 01:03:32,181
Some relatives and others,

1364
01:03:32,181 --> 01:03:33,980
they never call me.

1365
01:03:34,013 --> 01:03:36,847
They come and visit
once in a while

1366
01:03:36,881 --> 01:03:39,914
if they need something,
in most cases.

1367
01:03:39,947 --> 01:03:45,447
I learned not to help anybody
if I am not too sure of them.

1368
01:03:45,481 --> 01:03:48,182
Do you think that the success
of the Burger Baron

1369
01:03:48,182 --> 01:03:50,647
was a curse over your family

1370
01:03:50,681 --> 01:03:53,182
and your relationship
with your brothers?

1371
01:03:53,182 --> 01:03:56,414
Well it turns out,
it might be. It might be.

1372
01:03:56,447 --> 01:03:58,282
Because I was successful,

1373
01:03:58,315 --> 01:04:01,981
and everybody thinks
if they open Burger Baron,

1374
01:04:02,014 --> 01:04:04,814
they'll probably be like Rudy,
they'll be successful.

1375
01:04:04,847 --> 01:04:07,014
But, I mean, you have to work
like Rudy.

1376
01:04:07,047 --> 01:04:10,981
Not go picnic and leave staff
running the place.

1377
01:04:11,014 --> 01:04:14,081
You have to work
and work and work.

1378
01:04:14,182 --> 01:04:16,215
Anything you want to do,

1379
01:04:16,248 --> 01:04:18,215
you'll have to do it right
or don't do it,

1380
01:04:18,248 --> 01:04:19,815
simple as that.

1381
01:04:19,848 --> 01:04:25,748
I had enough of the whole deal,
and, to me, I should learn.

1382
01:04:25,782 --> 01:04:30,715
And I did learn,
so I'm okay after that.

1383
01:04:30,748 --> 01:04:33,216
OMAR: Rudy's decision
to pull back his influence

1384
01:04:33,249 --> 01:04:36,082
created an opportunity
for a new Godfather,

1385
01:04:36,183 --> 01:04:39,548
and one showed up
in the most unlikely form.

1386
01:04:39,582 --> 01:04:43,216
In 1996, two trademark
applications were submitted

1387
01:04:43,249 --> 01:04:44,915
for the Burger Baron name
and logo

1388
01:04:44,948 --> 01:04:46,583
from Regina, Saskatchewan,

1389
01:04:46,616 --> 01:04:48,216
and the applicant was none other

1390
01:04:48,249 --> 01:04:50,483
than Jack McDonnell's
widow Rikie.

1391
01:04:50,516 --> 01:04:52,816
She'd been operating
a popular Burger Baron

1392
01:04:52,849 --> 01:04:54,183
after his death,

1393
01:04:54,183 --> 01:04:56,216
and was preparing
to appoint her son James

1394
01:04:56,249 --> 01:04:57,349
to the throne.

1395
01:04:57,383 --> 01:04:59,216
TERRY: When Dad died,

1396
01:04:59,249 --> 01:05:01,749
Rikie moved back to Regina,

1397
01:05:01,783 --> 01:05:05,549
then she built a new one
on the lot.

1398
01:05:05,583 --> 01:05:08,049
REPORTER: While there are many
fast food choices available,

1399
01:05:08,083 --> 01:05:10,317
McDonnell hopes his gamble
will pay off

1400
01:05:10,350 --> 01:05:12,184
and cook up even more business

1401
01:05:12,184 --> 01:05:15,450
for his locally-owned
and-operated Burger Baron.

1402
01:05:15,484 --> 01:05:17,549
I'm a capitalist
and I just wanted

1403
01:05:17,583 --> 01:05:18,749
to grow the business,

1404
01:05:18,783 --> 01:05:20,184
and hopefully
move forward after this

1405
01:05:20,184 --> 01:05:22,949
maybe to Saskatoon
and other markets after this.

1406
01:05:22,983 --> 01:05:24,883
EMPLOYEE: There you go.
WOMAN: Thank you.

1407
01:05:24,916 --> 01:05:27,417
OMAR: Ready to expand
to a second location,

1408
01:05:27,450 --> 01:05:29,417
Rikie's sons
had advised their mom

1409
01:05:29,450 --> 01:05:32,450
to protect the family legacy
once and for all.

1410
01:05:32,484 --> 01:05:34,784
Their trademark was challenged
almost immediately

1411
01:05:34,817 --> 01:05:38,317
by another company,
Kemaldean Food Enterprises.

1412
01:05:38,350 --> 01:05:40,217
But it wasn't Rudy
in charge now.

1413
01:05:40,250 --> 01:05:42,084
It was his younger brother, Sal.

1414
01:05:42,185 --> 01:05:45,817
Rikie McDonnell applied
one week earlier than I did.

1415
01:05:45,850 --> 01:05:48,984
-OMAR: Just by coincidence?
-It's a coincidence. Yes.

1416
01:05:50,351 --> 01:05:52,385
The both of you decided...

1417
01:05:52,418 --> 01:05:53,950
-It is...
-...that it was time

1418
01:05:53,984 --> 01:05:57,385
to finally rein in
the Burger Baron

1419
01:05:57,418 --> 01:06:01,218
-after 34 years?
-Years.

1420
01:06:01,251 --> 01:06:03,185
That is the funniest part
about it.

1421
01:06:03,185 --> 01:06:07,785
I said, "Rikie, you applied
one week earlier than I do.

1422
01:06:07,818 --> 01:06:10,185
"I could be spending
a couple of $100,000

1423
01:06:10,185 --> 01:06:11,285
"for lawyers' fees,

1424
01:06:11,318 --> 01:06:12,385
"and you could be spending

1425
01:06:12,418 --> 01:06:14,218
"a couple $100,000
for lawyers' fees

1426
01:06:14,251 --> 01:06:15,785
"and we will not get anywhere."

1427
01:06:15,818 --> 01:06:17,785
OMAR: Rather than fight it
in court,

1428
01:06:17,818 --> 01:06:19,718
they decided to split
the territory.

1429
01:06:19,751 --> 01:06:22,718
Rikie would get Eastern Canada
and the US,

1430
01:06:22,751 --> 01:06:25,319
and the Kemaldeans
would get Alberta and BC.

1431
01:06:26,685 --> 01:06:29,018
TERRY: Rikie talked to me
about it, and I said,

1432
01:06:29,051 --> 01:06:30,386
"I don't think you should.

1433
01:06:30,419 --> 01:06:32,518
"I think you should leave
that one alone."

1434
01:06:32,551 --> 01:06:34,452
The name is across the country,

1435
01:06:34,486 --> 01:06:36,386
you can't go back
to them and say,

1436
01:06:36,419 --> 01:06:38,519
"You owe me a whole bunch
of franchise fees,

1437
01:06:39,985 --> 01:06:42,619
"a percentage of your gross
in the last 20 years."

1438
01:06:42,652 --> 01:06:43,985
You know, that's not gonna work.

1439
01:06:44,018 --> 01:06:48,786
The evidentiary question
of who started Burger Baron,

1440
01:06:48,819 --> 01:06:51,519
who had the original IP,

1441
01:06:51,552 --> 01:06:54,452
is so lost in time

1442
01:06:54,486 --> 01:06:58,786
that it would be very difficult
for somebody to succeed

1443
01:06:58,819 --> 01:07:00,352
on either a passing-off claim

1444
01:07:00,386 --> 01:07:03,187
or a trademark
enforcement claim.

1445
01:07:03,220 --> 01:07:04,886
TERRY: The corporation
had the rights

1446
01:07:04,919 --> 01:07:06,519
to the trade name,

1447
01:07:06,552 --> 01:07:08,353
and the corporation went under,

1448
01:07:08,387 --> 01:07:09,752
and nobody had it.

1449
01:07:09,786 --> 01:07:12,520
It was up for anybody
who wants it.

1450
01:07:12,553 --> 01:07:14,220
Anyway, they went ahead with it.

1451
01:07:14,253 --> 01:07:15,886
I don't think anything
came of it.

1452
01:07:21,787 --> 01:07:23,687
OMAR: Certainly
nothing came of it for Rikie

1453
01:07:23,720 --> 01:07:25,187
out in Saskatchewan.

1454
01:07:25,220 --> 01:07:26,920
She was the lone Baroness

1455
01:07:26,952 --> 01:07:28,520
running two
successful restaurants

1456
01:07:28,553 --> 01:07:30,453
with her son, James.

1457
01:07:30,487 --> 01:07:32,487
But Alberta
was a different story.

1458
01:07:33,420 --> 01:07:35,053
When we got the franchise,

1459
01:07:35,087 --> 01:07:37,053
that's when I got stern
with everybody.

1460
01:07:41,487 --> 01:07:43,188
Nobody cared about it,

1461
01:07:43,188 --> 01:07:44,787
as long as they're making money
and putting it in their pocket,

1462
01:07:44,820 --> 01:07:46,587
they don't care about what
the Burger Baron looks like.

1463
01:07:46,620 --> 01:07:48,953
He said, "Excuse me,
who allowed you

1464
01:07:48,987 --> 01:07:50,720
"to open Burger Baron?"

1465
01:07:50,753 --> 01:07:53,053
I said, "Well,
I allowed myself."

1466
01:07:53,087 --> 01:07:58,188
He phoned and he told me
he's the original owner.

1467
01:07:58,221 --> 01:08:03,020
I never said that I invented
the Burger Baron, or did that.

1468
01:08:22,322 --> 01:08:25,422
He said, "You know, the name,

1469
01:08:25,455 --> 01:08:29,289
"it's gonna cost you $450
a month."

1470
01:08:29,322 --> 01:08:31,355
So I said,
"You're not getting nothing."

1471
01:08:31,389 --> 01:08:32,455
See, that's the problem

1472
01:08:32,489 --> 01:08:34,355
with the Lebanese mentality
this way.

1473
01:08:34,389 --> 01:08:37,088
They cannot accept
one person in charge.

1474
01:08:37,189 --> 01:08:39,455
They cannot.
It's against their genes.

1475
01:08:39,489 --> 01:08:43,088
Whether he allowed me or not,
I'm not gonna keep it, anyway.

1476
01:08:43,189 --> 01:08:44,755
Until I see something legal.

1477
01:08:44,789 --> 01:08:46,189
I don't care who it is.

1478
01:08:46,189 --> 01:08:47,489
You should've seen me with my...

1479
01:08:47,522 --> 01:08:49,189
I fired my kids one time.

1480
01:08:51,989 --> 01:08:53,289
If I do it with my family,

1481
01:08:53,322 --> 01:08:55,322
do you think I wouldn't
do it to some nincompoop?

1482
01:09:14,190 --> 01:09:15,756
I didn't do anything.

1483
01:09:15,790 --> 01:09:17,955
So things went with the wind.

1484
01:09:20,055 --> 01:09:22,990
I became the bad guy
of the Burger Baron.

1485
01:09:23,022 --> 01:09:25,723
And Rudy is the Godfather
of the Burger Baron.

1486
01:09:29,390 --> 01:09:30,990
OMAR: Although Sal Kemaldean

1487
01:09:31,023 --> 01:09:32,756
had bought into the rights
to oversee Burger Baron

1488
01:09:32,790 --> 01:09:34,191
in western Canada,

1489
01:09:34,224 --> 01:09:37,856
that didn't give him ownership
over the brand's IP.

1490
01:09:37,890 --> 01:09:39,990
When the company's
president James learned

1491
01:09:40,023 --> 01:09:41,923
his partner had been
misrepresenting himself

1492
01:09:41,956 --> 01:09:43,224
as the founder

1493
01:09:43,257 --> 01:09:46,023
and using his slogans
without permission,

1494
01:09:46,056 --> 01:09:48,224
he threatened Sal
with a cease-and-desist.

1495
01:09:49,790 --> 01:09:52,023
Soon after they resolved
their issues,

1496
01:09:52,056 --> 01:09:54,191
Sal resigned
and passed his company shares

1497
01:09:54,224 --> 01:09:57,090
down to his next of kin,
a Baroness.

1498
01:09:58,291 --> 01:10:00,757
My name is Tamara
Kemaleddine Anghel

1499
01:10:00,791 --> 01:10:02,424
and my relationship
to the Burger Baron

1500
01:10:02,457 --> 01:10:05,357
is I am now a 50% shareholder

1501
01:10:05,391 --> 01:10:06,857
of Burger Baron Canada.

1502
01:10:06,891 --> 01:10:08,524
Burger Baron's
been part of my life

1503
01:10:08,557 --> 01:10:10,324
for as far back
as I can remember.

1504
01:10:10,357 --> 01:10:13,091
I ran my own location
for 21 years

1505
01:10:13,124 --> 01:10:14,524
here in Lethbridge, as well.

1506
01:10:14,557 --> 01:10:16,325
So, it's just in our blood.

1507
01:10:16,358 --> 01:10:18,425
I think the biggest obstacle

1508
01:10:19,624 --> 01:10:22,924
is trying to band
everyone together

1509
01:10:22,957 --> 01:10:25,824
to realize that things
could be stronger

1510
01:10:25,857 --> 01:10:28,258
as opposed to having them feel

1511
01:10:28,292 --> 01:10:30,158
that you're taking away
from them.

1512
01:10:30,192 --> 01:10:32,991
And I think it's just a lot
of old-school mentality,

1513
01:10:33,024 --> 01:10:34,091
Lebanese mentality.

1514
01:10:34,124 --> 01:10:35,858
"I'm the best,
and why do you think

1515
01:10:35,892 --> 01:10:38,192
"you can do something better
than I can do?"

1516
01:10:38,225 --> 01:10:39,492
Whereas I'm not trying
to tell them

1517
01:10:39,525 --> 01:10:42,758
that I can do something better
than you can do,

1518
01:10:42,792 --> 01:10:44,592
but you've got ideas,
and I've got ideas,

1519
01:10:44,625 --> 01:10:46,492
and he's got ideas,
and she's got ideas,

1520
01:10:46,525 --> 01:10:47,858
and we put them all together,

1521
01:10:47,892 --> 01:10:50,392
and we can be something real
and something strong,

1522
01:10:50,425 --> 01:10:51,992
as opposed to just being a meme.

1523
01:10:52,025 --> 01:10:54,492
OMAR: How realistic
do you think it is

1524
01:10:54,525 --> 01:10:57,758
for the Burger Barons
to come together and agree,

1525
01:10:57,792 --> 01:11:01,758
not just to elect one Baron,
but one Baroness?

1526
01:11:01,792 --> 01:11:04,359
How likely,
at its present situation?

1527
01:11:05,758 --> 01:11:06,758
Not great.

1528
01:11:07,659 --> 01:11:09,559
But I believe in the future,

1529
01:11:09,593 --> 01:11:11,025
and the younger generation

1530
01:11:12,925 --> 01:11:14,893
have the ability
to see outside that box

1531
01:11:14,926 --> 01:11:17,426
and that could become a reality.

1532
01:11:17,459 --> 01:11:20,193
I just don't think that women

1533
01:11:20,193 --> 01:11:22,293
in the Lebanese culture,
are given enough opportunity

1534
01:11:22,326 --> 01:11:23,559
to be able to do that.

1535
01:11:23,593 --> 01:11:25,293
It's always the men
in the control

1536
01:11:25,326 --> 01:11:27,959
and the women
are the silent ones.

1537
01:11:27,993 --> 01:11:30,093
Even though they do have a pull
and they do have a say,

1538
01:11:30,194 --> 01:11:33,294
it's the men that are the face
of any business that's been run.

1539
01:11:33,327 --> 01:11:35,427
OMAR: In those eight years,
have you managed

1540
01:11:35,460 --> 01:11:38,059
to successfully franchise
a new Burger Baron?

1541
01:11:38,093 --> 01:11:39,227
-Not yet.
-No.

1542
01:11:39,260 --> 01:11:41,594
Do you think that owning
the copyright

1543
01:11:41,627 --> 01:11:43,959
then encouraged more knock-offs?

1544
01:11:43,993 --> 01:11:46,793
The knock-offs have been around
for a while as well.

1545
01:11:46,826 --> 01:11:48,993
They're not running
as a Burger Baron.

1546
01:11:49,026 --> 01:11:50,894
Some of them
have been Burger Barons

1547
01:11:50,926 --> 01:11:52,194
and change their names,

1548
01:11:52,194 --> 01:11:53,993
but I don't think
that there's any new,

1549
01:11:54,026 --> 01:11:56,460
recent abundance
of knock-offs, no.

1550
01:12:10,361 --> 01:12:12,228
The brand identity
is completely different.

1551
01:12:12,261 --> 01:12:14,328
The color schemes
are completely different.

1552
01:12:14,361 --> 01:12:16,894
And it's Burger Barons,
with an S.

1553
01:12:16,927 --> 01:12:18,860
It's not a Burger Baron.

1554
01:12:18,894 --> 01:12:23,094
I have faith that the brand
can first grow within Alberta,

1555
01:12:24,195 --> 01:12:26,994
and then other places,
internationally.

1556
01:12:27,027 --> 01:12:31,195
I have all the qualifications
to do that, humbly speaking.

1557
01:12:31,195 --> 01:12:32,861
I worked in Switzerland,
I worked in Germany,

1558
01:12:32,895 --> 01:12:36,728
in Dubai and London
as a marketing director.

1559
01:12:36,761 --> 01:12:38,895
My childhood
was actually in Toronto.

1560
01:12:38,928 --> 01:12:40,361
My parents came down

1561
01:12:40,395 --> 01:12:42,861
to visit family friends
in Alberta a long time ago.

1562
01:12:42,895 --> 01:12:44,861
Every time I wanted
to come and have a burger,

1563
01:12:44,895 --> 01:12:46,895
I'll tell my parents,
"Let's go to Uncle Nazzi."

1564
01:12:46,928 --> 01:12:48,196
Little did I know,

1565
01:12:48,196 --> 01:12:49,229
I'm gonna come back to the place

1566
01:12:49,262 --> 01:12:50,761
that I held close to my heart.

1567
01:12:51,561 --> 01:12:53,362
I want to ensure

1568
01:12:53,396 --> 01:12:55,661
that the brand lives
in the hearts of the people

1569
01:12:55,695 --> 01:12:57,661
like it lived in my heart
as a child.

1570
01:12:57,695 --> 01:13:01,362
The newer menu is by far
much more sophisticated.

1571
01:13:01,396 --> 01:13:03,796
We've changed
the Mushroom Burger recipe.

1572
01:13:03,828 --> 01:13:05,629
So the secret recipes
for the rest of the burgers

1573
01:13:05,662 --> 01:13:07,196
isn't made available.

1574
01:13:07,229 --> 01:13:10,296
Unless they franchise with me,
then only will it be available.

1575
01:13:10,329 --> 01:13:12,962
I've actually trademarked
the logo and the identity,

1576
01:13:12,996 --> 01:13:14,562
and the menu, and the name.

1577
01:13:15,929 --> 01:13:18,062
I've been going back
and forth with my lawyer

1578
01:13:18,096 --> 01:13:19,696
on different aspects of it,

1579
01:13:19,729 --> 01:13:23,362
and what can hold ground
and what can't.

1580
01:13:23,396 --> 01:13:24,762
So it's really up in the air.

1581
01:13:24,796 --> 01:13:26,529
OMAR: What about
the Burger Baron

1582
01:13:26,562 --> 01:13:28,029
parody account on Twitter?

1583
01:13:28,062 --> 01:13:29,096
Yeah, I've...

1584
01:13:30,197 --> 01:13:31,629
-You're not familiar?
-Yes.

1585
01:13:31,662 --> 01:13:33,629
-Okay.
-I know about them. (CHUCKLES)

1586
01:13:37,197 --> 01:13:39,263
MAN 8: On Twitter,
there is a Burger Baron account,

1587
01:13:39,297 --> 01:13:42,062
and it's run by somebody,
eh, we don't know who.

1588
01:13:42,096 --> 01:13:44,263
He will tweet a lot of opinions,

1589
01:13:44,297 --> 01:13:46,096
profane and profound.

1590
01:13:46,197 --> 01:13:47,530
I love it. I think it's great.

1591
01:13:47,563 --> 01:13:49,029
It does give us a bad name.

1592
01:13:49,062 --> 01:13:50,897
And that's not who we are
and that's not what we promote.

1593
01:13:50,930 --> 01:13:52,230
I think it's pretty funny.

1594
01:13:52,263 --> 01:13:54,697
It's kind of raunchy,
it's not PG.

1595
01:13:54,730 --> 01:13:56,863
Not a lot of people know

1596
01:13:56,897 --> 01:14:00,330
that it's not
an official account.

1597
01:14:00,363 --> 01:14:02,030
You know,
we're a family-run business

1598
01:14:02,063 --> 01:14:03,364
and we support all franchises,

1599
01:14:03,397 --> 01:14:04,763
but obviously it hurts us.

1600
01:14:04,797 --> 01:14:06,963
It's not right to bash
another restaurant.

1601
01:14:06,997 --> 01:14:08,264
I know that's a fake account.

1602
01:14:08,298 --> 01:14:09,763
I'm aware. I'm aware of that.

1603
01:14:09,797 --> 01:14:11,331
Yes. I don't know who that is.

1604
01:14:11,364 --> 01:14:12,464
Is that you?

1605
01:14:12,498 --> 01:14:14,531
It makes us look like a bad guy,

1606
01:14:14,564 --> 01:14:16,298
that we're, oh, all about us

1607
01:14:16,331 --> 01:14:18,498
and only us,
and that's not true.

1608
01:14:18,531 --> 01:14:20,364
I find his humor funny.

1609
01:14:20,398 --> 01:14:21,531
Is that you?

1610
01:14:21,564 --> 01:14:23,030
No, Whallah, it's not me.

1611
01:14:23,063 --> 01:14:25,931
OMAR: It's not me, I swear.

1612
01:14:25,964 --> 01:14:27,831
I tried my best
to get the mystery person

1613
01:14:27,864 --> 01:14:29,764
to come forward, clear my name,

1614
01:14:29,798 --> 01:14:32,631
or at least explain
their obsession with the Baron.

1615
01:14:36,664 --> 01:14:38,498
I offered them
the full anonymity

1616
01:14:38,531 --> 01:14:40,998
of a government whistle-blower.

1617
01:14:41,031 --> 01:14:43,365
But even revealing themselves
to a handful of people

1618
01:14:43,399 --> 01:14:44,931
was apparently too risky.

1619
01:14:47,864 --> 01:14:50,532
However, I did manage
to get a few questions through.

1620
01:14:51,399 --> 01:14:52,665
OMAR: I can pass that to you,

1621
01:14:53,565 --> 01:14:55,064
and then you read the answers.

1622
01:14:57,199 --> 01:14:58,265
OMAR: What inspired you
to create

1623
01:14:58,299 --> 01:14:59,465
the Burger Baron parody account?

1624
01:14:59,499 --> 01:15:01,199
"It was clear that the Baron
needed a voice

1625
01:15:01,199 --> 01:15:03,699
"and someone for the loyal
customers to rally around.

01:15:03,732 --> 01:15:06,032

01:15:06,064 --> 01:15:07,199

1634
01:15:19,065 --> 01:15:21,565
It feels like he's trying
to hold on to a childhood.

01:15:21,599 --> 01:15:22,999
"When did you start
picking fights

01:15:23,032 --> 01:15:25,200

Yeah.

Obviously, he...

1668
01:16:27,867 --> 01:16:29,501
He holds Burger Baron
in his heart,

1669
01:16:29,534 --> 01:16:32,202
but I just think
he goes about it

1670
01:16:32,202 --> 01:16:33,734
quite disrespectful
to Burger Baron.

1671
01:16:33,767 --> 01:16:36,501
OMAR: There is a certain
subset of people

1672
01:16:36,534 --> 01:16:40,268
for whom the parody account
is actually good advertising.

1673
01:16:40,302 --> 01:16:44,001
They kind of love the fact
that the Burger Baron

1674
01:16:44,034 --> 01:16:47,202
has been a bit of a shitshow.

1675
01:16:47,202 --> 01:16:49,402
I have no idea what
the appeal to that would be.

1676
01:16:49,435 --> 01:16:51,202
DONOVAN: Because it's been
a photocopy

1677
01:16:51,202 --> 01:16:52,802
of a photocopy of a print

1678
01:16:52,835 --> 01:16:54,101
of a photocopy of a photo

1679
01:16:54,202 --> 01:16:56,802
that somebody took
on their Polaroid,

1680
01:16:56,835 --> 01:16:58,268
there's all these variations.

1681
01:16:58,302 --> 01:17:00,335
And I don't know
if that's part of the charm.

1682
01:17:00,368 --> 01:17:02,635
ALADEAN: I've talked people,
tried to explain it,

1683
01:17:02,668 --> 01:17:04,968
because if someone sees me
with a tattoo of it,

1684
01:17:05,002 --> 01:17:06,635
they're like,
"What the hell is that?"

1685
01:17:06,668 --> 01:17:08,468
I'm like, "Yeah, no,
it's a burger and it's good,

1686
01:17:08,502 --> 01:17:10,835
"but it's spongy,
so it's kind of weird.

And people are like,
"That sounds terrible."

1691
01:17:18,369 --> 01:17:19,635
And I'm like,
"No, it's really good."

1692
01:17:19,668 --> 01:17:20,968
Burger Baron represents

1693
01:17:21,002 --> 01:17:24,569
every amazing small town
in Alberta

1694
01:17:24,603 --> 01:17:27,569
and what it's like to live
in a small town in Alberta.

1695
01:17:27,603 --> 01:17:30,203
That's part of the amazing story
that I think is awesome,

1696
01:17:30,236 --> 01:17:32,569
that it's this amazing
immigration story

1697
01:17:32,603 --> 01:17:34,303
where people come here...

1698
01:17:34,336 --> 01:17:36,703
Could you imagine
living in Alberta in the '70s?

1699
01:17:36,736 --> 01:17:39,703
We're not the most progressive
place in the world.

1700
01:17:39,736 --> 01:17:42,336
I can't imagine how hard
that would have been

1701
01:17:42,369 --> 01:17:44,503
to be slightly different
than everybody else

1702
01:17:44,536 --> 01:17:45,636
and trying to fit in.

1703
01:17:45,669 --> 01:17:48,204
Well, you lived it.

1704
01:17:48,237 --> 01:17:50,903
OMAR: I wouldn't
exactly say that I lived it.

1705
01:17:50,936 --> 01:17:54,036
By the time I was born,
my family was well-established.

1706
01:17:54,069 --> 01:17:55,703
But my parents lived it.

1707
01:17:55,736 --> 01:17:57,969
It's just something
they don't like to talk about.

1708
01:17:58,003 --> 01:18:02,270
Did you guys ever face
any racism or discrimination?

1709
01:18:02,304 --> 01:18:03,470
-Never.
-Never.

1710
01:18:13,970 --> 01:18:15,304
TAMAM: Not a slap like you mean.

1711
01:18:15,337 --> 01:18:17,270
-(OMAR LAUGHS)
-You translate it to English,

1712
01:18:17,304 --> 01:18:18,404
it's not a...

1713
01:18:18,437 --> 01:18:20,270
OMAR: You've never slapped
a guy, okay.

1714
01:18:20,304 --> 01:18:22,204
But have you wanted
to slap a guy?

1715
01:18:24,670 --> 01:18:29,205
You don't think people ever
got upset or jealous

1716
01:18:29,205 --> 01:18:33,271
that immigrants coming
into this small town

1717
01:18:33,305 --> 01:18:37,338
and really, you know, ascending?

1718
01:18:58,505 --> 01:19:00,205
OMAR: I got the sense
from my parents

1719
01:19:00,205 --> 01:19:01,938
and the other
first generation Barons

1720
01:19:01,971 --> 01:19:04,338
that they were holding back
the truth a little bit,

1721
01:19:04,371 --> 01:19:06,805
either because they had
a business to protect

1722
01:19:06,838 --> 01:19:08,306
and they didn't want
to rock the boat,

1723
01:19:08,339 --> 01:19:12,005
or they just didn't want
to appear ungrateful.

1724
01:19:12,038 --> 01:19:13,539
When was the last time
you ate at Burger Baron?

1725
01:19:13,571 --> 01:19:15,206
I don't know. It's been a while,

1726
01:19:15,206 --> 01:19:18,572
but when my parents
came over last weekend,

1727
01:19:19,472 --> 01:19:20,606
I asked them to bring me

1728
01:19:20,639 --> 01:19:22,038
-a Mushroom Burger.

can be fertile ground

1730
01:19:24,038 --> 01:19:25,372
to start a successful business

1731
01:19:25,406 --> 01:19:27,706
and secure
your children's future.

1732
01:19:27,739 --> 01:19:29,506
But it can come
at another cost for them.

1733
01:19:30,239 --> 01:19:31,606
Thank you.

1734
01:19:31,639 --> 01:19:33,872
Nobody knows this better
than Nizar Watfa,

1735
01:19:33,906 --> 01:19:36,372
a Burger Baronet
who turned those hardships

1736
01:19:36,406 --> 01:19:37,672
into a persona.

1737
01:19:37,706 --> 01:19:39,306
ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen,

1738
01:19:39,339 --> 01:19:43,939
-Sheik Akbar Shabaz.
-(ALL CHEERING)

1739
01:19:43,972 --> 01:19:45,340
NIZAR: Well,
ever since I was a kid,

1740
01:19:45,373 --> 01:19:47,539
for as long as I can remember,

1741
01:19:47,572 --> 01:19:49,706
I had to deal with it
to some extent.

1742
01:19:49,739 --> 01:19:51,373
When I first moved to Lamont,

1743
01:19:51,407 --> 01:19:52,839
there was a quite a bit
of racism.

1744
01:19:52,872 --> 01:19:54,340
People would make fun
of my name.

1745
01:19:54,373 --> 01:19:57,972
And once they got to know me,
they kind of stopped,

1746
01:19:58,006 --> 01:20:00,173
but there was always
still one or two kids

1747
01:20:00,207 --> 01:20:01,939
that would say something

1748
01:20:01,972 --> 01:20:03,573
that was kind of
off-color or racist.

1749
01:20:05,139 --> 01:20:06,972
-To them, it was normal.
-Yeah.

1750
01:20:07,006 --> 01:20:08,540
And they would laugh,
kind of thing.

1751
01:20:08,573 --> 01:20:11,607
But whether it hurt me or not,
I wouldn't let people see it.

1752
01:20:11,640 --> 01:20:13,673
When you bring it up
with the Burger Baron owners,

1753
01:20:13,707 --> 01:20:15,273
it's a completely
different answer

1754
01:20:15,307 --> 01:20:17,040
based on the generation you ask.

1755
01:20:17,073 --> 01:20:21,007
NIZAR: I think that a lot
of it had to do with...

1756
01:20:21,040 --> 01:20:23,341
Maybe they didn't know

1757
01:20:23,374 --> 01:20:24,707
that you can say something.

1758
01:20:24,740 --> 01:20:27,607
My dad was always worried
about us

1759
01:20:27,640 --> 01:20:29,508
because we're the only minority

1760
01:20:29,541 --> 01:20:31,274
in a small farm town, right?

1761
01:20:31,308 --> 01:20:33,140
So just to keep us safe,

1762
01:20:33,174 --> 01:20:35,840
it was easier just to keep us
in the restaurant.

1763
01:20:35,873 --> 01:20:39,040
My parents have
that old-school mentality

1764
01:20:39,073 --> 01:20:41,007
where it's like,
the family helps the family,

1765
01:20:41,040 --> 01:20:43,774
and it doesn't matter
what is going on.

1766
01:20:43,808 --> 01:20:46,341
But when you're a teenager
and whatever, like,

1767
01:20:46,374 --> 01:20:49,208
work is the last thing
you want to do.

1768
01:20:49,241 --> 01:20:51,308
When people ask me,
"What was your first job?"

1769
01:20:51,341 --> 01:20:53,974
-I tell them it was slavery.
-(LAUGHS)

1770
01:20:54,008 --> 01:20:55,708
Because it felt like, you know,

1771
01:20:55,741 --> 01:20:58,541
they were just always
cracking the whip on me,

1772
01:20:58,574 --> 01:21:01,541
trying to get me to work
more, work harder,

1773
01:21:01,574 --> 01:21:04,242
but they're trying
to keep me out of trouble

1774
01:21:04,275 --> 01:21:07,509
and just make sure
that I have a good work ethic.

1775
01:21:07,542 --> 01:21:09,774
-Are you the oldest son?
-Mmm.

1776
01:21:09,808 --> 01:21:10,874
-You are?
-Yeah.

1777
01:21:10,908 --> 01:21:12,209
Do you think
that played a part in it?

1778
01:21:12,242 --> 01:21:14,941
Because my older brother and me,

1779
01:21:14,974 --> 01:21:16,542
we had very different
experiences

1780
01:21:16,575 --> 01:21:17,874
-with the Burger Baron.
-Yeah.

1781
01:21:17,908 --> 01:21:19,675
Where like, yeah,
I was working in it

1782
01:21:19,709 --> 01:21:21,342
at a young age,

1783
01:21:21,375 --> 01:21:23,742
but I think it was more
about just teaching me

1784
01:21:23,775 --> 01:21:25,242
about the value of work.

1785
01:21:25,275 --> 01:21:27,275
But with my brother,
he was clearly being groomed.

1786
01:21:27,309 --> 01:21:28,675
My dad would always say,

1787
01:21:28,709 --> 01:21:30,409
"When I'm not around,
you're the man of the house,

1788
01:21:30,442 --> 01:21:32,409
"you have to take care of things

1789
01:21:32,442 --> 01:21:34,342
"and make sure everybody
and everything's okay.

1790
01:21:34,375 --> 01:21:35,742
"This is your job."

1791
01:21:35,775 --> 01:21:37,276
(PAPER RUSTLING)

1792
01:21:38,975 --> 01:21:43,775
OMAR: So, my brother took over
the restaurant in 2008.

1793
01:21:43,809 --> 01:21:46,009
He wanted
to take the opportunity

1794
01:21:46,042 --> 01:21:47,609
to do his own thing with it,

1795
01:21:47,642 --> 01:21:50,376
change the name,
and it surprised me.

1796
01:21:50,410 --> 01:21:54,276
There was not a moment
in my life

1797
01:21:54,310 --> 01:21:57,210
where I thought
about running the restaurant,

1798
01:21:57,210 --> 01:21:58,276
not even...

1799
01:21:58,310 --> 01:22:00,776
Not even a hypothetical.

1800
01:22:00,810 --> 01:22:04,109
I appreciate the fact
that it did so much

1801
01:22:04,210 --> 01:22:06,843
for my family
and me, personally.

1802
01:22:06,876 --> 01:22:09,776
I went to college
without any student loans.

1803
01:22:09,810 --> 01:22:11,776
I came out debt-free.

1804
01:22:11,810 --> 01:22:13,443
Why? Because of Burger Baron.

1805
01:22:13,476 --> 01:22:15,910
There were some cool perks
to it as well.

1806
01:22:15,943 --> 01:22:17,976
Nothing will win over
friends more

1807
01:22:18,010 --> 01:22:21,411
than being able to order
a pizza to their house

1808
01:22:21,444 --> 01:22:22,511
when you've got the munchies,

1809
01:22:22,543 --> 01:22:25,076
and have it there
in half an hour, free.

1810
01:22:25,110 --> 01:22:26,843
Just saying.

1811
01:22:26,876 --> 01:22:29,010
At the same time,
the Burger Baron

1812
01:22:29,043 --> 01:22:31,344
can be like a prison sometimes.

1813
01:22:31,377 --> 01:22:33,110
And I don't judge
my parents for it

1814
01:22:33,211 --> 01:22:35,777
because I know that they had
the right priorities.

1815
01:22:35,811 --> 01:22:37,311
But now that I have kids,

1816
01:22:37,344 --> 01:22:39,010
I can't imagine

1817
01:22:39,043 --> 01:22:41,444
how that would weigh
on my conscience,

1818
01:22:41,477 --> 01:22:44,811
to miss out on the things
that they're passionate about.

1819
01:22:45,611 --> 01:22:46,944
I don't think we actually

1820
01:22:46,977 --> 01:22:49,111
have ever really sat down
and talked

1821
01:22:49,212 --> 01:22:51,212
about what we wanted
to do with our lives.

1822
01:22:52,611 --> 01:22:54,212
We're coming up to it.

1823
01:22:54,212 --> 01:22:56,477
Here it is. I haven't
seen that sign in a while.

1824
01:23:06,212 --> 01:23:08,645
Was it hard for you

1825
01:23:08,678 --> 01:23:10,478
to dishonor your family's legacy

1826
01:23:10,512 --> 01:23:13,578
-by calling it "Boondocks"?
-The Boondocks Grill?

1827
01:23:13,612 --> 01:23:16,212
No. I didn't really want
a whole lot to do

1828
01:23:16,212 --> 01:23:17,245
with that name.

1829
01:23:17,278 --> 01:23:18,912
Nothing against
the Burger Barons.

1830
01:23:18,945 --> 01:23:20,712
I love Burger Baron food.

1831
01:23:20,745 --> 01:23:22,578
I love walking
into a Burger Baron,

1832
01:23:22,612 --> 01:23:24,078
but it needed to be my own.

1833
01:23:24,112 --> 01:23:26,412
There's that nostalgic feeling
when you're driving

1834
01:23:26,445 --> 01:23:28,678
through a small town,
a Prairie town,

1835
01:23:28,712 --> 01:23:29,745
and you see a Burger Baron.

1836
01:23:29,778 --> 01:23:31,078
You can walk in there,

1837
01:23:31,112 --> 01:23:33,246
and it's like walking through
a time machine.

1838
01:23:33,279 --> 01:23:36,246
I just didn't want that.

1839
01:23:36,279 --> 01:23:39,213
I wanted the town
to have something

1840
01:23:39,246 --> 01:23:41,479
that was a little more modern.

1841
01:23:41,513 --> 01:23:43,213
We wanted to have a place

1842
01:23:43,213 --> 01:23:47,713
where people can meet for work,
they can come on a date,

1843
01:23:47,746 --> 01:23:50,213
maybe something closer
to the city than a small town.

1844
01:23:50,213 --> 01:23:51,713
When did you realize

1845
01:23:51,746 --> 01:23:54,213
that you were being groomed

1846
01:23:54,213 --> 01:23:56,213
to take over
the family restaurant?

1847
01:23:56,246 --> 01:23:57,346
I had no desire to work
anywhere else

1848
01:23:57,379 --> 01:23:58,813
when I was younger.

1849
01:23:58,846 --> 01:24:00,713
I didn't want to work
for someone that I didn't know,

1850
01:24:00,746 --> 01:24:02,446
I'd rather work for my dad.

1851
01:24:02,479 --> 01:24:04,446
I just assumed it was because
you were the eldest son.

1852
01:24:04,479 --> 01:24:06,413
That probably had something
to do with it, too.

1853
01:24:06,446 --> 01:24:08,247
When it comes to the oldest son,

1854
01:24:08,280 --> 01:24:10,079
I don't know
if they expect more.

1855
01:24:10,113 --> 01:24:11,446
They definitely expect more.

1856
01:24:11,479 --> 01:24:13,746
-Okay, they expected more.
-(LAUGHS)

1857
01:24:13,779 --> 01:24:16,414
I don't know if I wanted
any other choices.

1858
01:24:16,447 --> 01:24:17,979
But at some time,

1859
01:24:18,013 --> 01:24:19,979
you just accept
that if I want to provide

1860
01:24:20,013 --> 01:24:21,946
for the family
like Mom and Dad did,

1861
01:24:21,979 --> 01:24:23,979
then this was really
my one shot.

1862
01:24:24,913 --> 01:24:26,314
So when Dad tells me

1863
01:24:27,247 --> 01:24:29,347
in 2008 that the current owners

1864
01:24:30,214 --> 01:24:32,314
don't want to renew their lease,

1865
01:24:32,347 --> 01:24:36,414
and there's a possibility
of him selling,

1866
01:24:36,447 --> 01:24:37,647
that scares me,

1867
01:24:38,580 --> 01:24:41,580
knowing that my last chance

1868
01:24:41,614 --> 01:24:43,380
of having this as my own

1869
01:24:43,414 --> 01:24:44,580
could possibly be gone.

1870
01:24:44,614 --> 01:24:46,714
Did it bother you that I had

1871
01:24:46,747 --> 01:24:49,047
a lot more freedom
of choice, maybe,

1872
01:24:49,080 --> 01:24:51,714
with what I was going to do
with my life?

1873
01:24:51,747 --> 01:24:53,281
-A little bit, I guess.
-Yeah.

1874
01:24:53,315 --> 01:24:55,215
A little bit.
And I didn't understand

1875
01:24:55,215 --> 01:24:57,315
why you had these options,

1876
01:24:57,348 --> 01:24:59,814
but with me,
maybe I was already,

1877
01:24:59,847 --> 01:25:01,014
like you said, groomed for it.

1878
01:25:01,047 --> 01:25:03,315
"He's already learned
these skills,

1879
01:25:03,348 --> 01:25:05,481
"might as well
take advantage of it."

1880
01:25:06,581 --> 01:25:07,848
OMAR: A funny thing happened

1881
01:25:07,881 --> 01:25:10,548
after my family's restaurant
was renamed.

1882
01:25:10,581 --> 01:25:12,881
Another immigrant
moved to High Prairie,

1883
01:25:12,915 --> 01:25:14,681
bought up a rundown restaurant,

1884
01:25:14,715 --> 01:25:17,781
renovated it
and renamed it what else?

1885
01:25:17,815 --> 01:25:19,215
Burger Baron.

1886
01:25:19,215 --> 01:25:20,681
ALI: I know they're doing well,
and good for them.

1887
01:25:20,715 --> 01:25:22,548
I love to hear that story
of someone coming

1888
01:25:22,581 --> 01:25:25,015
from back home,
bringing their family here,

1889
01:25:25,048 --> 01:25:27,048
raising them
in the small community

1890
01:25:27,081 --> 01:25:28,715
where there isn't much
of an Arab community,

1891
01:25:28,748 --> 01:25:31,015
and doing their own thing
and being successful.

1892
01:25:31,048 --> 01:25:32,482
How could you not love
that story?

1893
01:25:32,516 --> 01:25:35,216
OMAR: It was one of the last
Burger Barons to open

1894
01:25:35,216 --> 01:25:37,115
made possible
only because the man

1895
01:25:37,216 --> 01:25:39,616
who started it,
and has since sold it,

1896
01:25:39,649 --> 01:25:41,382
was a relative
of the Kemaldeans.

1897
01:25:41,416 --> 01:25:42,549
Let's try this milkshake.

1898
01:25:44,416 --> 01:25:46,282
That's a perfect milkshake.
Thank you.

1899
01:25:46,316 --> 01:25:47,382
You're welcome.

1900
01:25:48,649 --> 01:25:50,216
OMAR: The family's
exclusive rights

1901
01:25:50,216 --> 01:25:53,349
have only prevented
new Burger Barons from opening.

1902
01:25:53,382 --> 01:25:55,016
More importantly,
it's done nothing

1903
01:25:55,049 --> 01:25:57,016
to stop them from closing.

1904
01:25:57,049 --> 01:25:59,217
More than a third
of existing Burger Barons

1905
01:25:59,217 --> 01:26:00,816
have closed in the last decade.

1906
01:26:02,283 --> 01:26:05,416
Including Rudy's
last spot in Edmonton.

1907
01:26:05,449 --> 01:26:07,417
Including Sal
and his daughter Tamara's

1908
01:26:07,450 --> 01:26:09,317
three locations
in southern Alberta.

1909
01:26:10,049 --> 01:26:11,283
Including the last two

1910
01:26:11,317 --> 01:26:13,217
owned by the McDonnell family
in Regina.

1911
01:26:14,649 --> 01:26:15,916
As big box restaurants,

1912
01:26:15,949 --> 01:26:18,116
upscale casual dining
and foodie culture

1913
01:26:18,217 --> 01:26:20,217
encroached
on the humble hamburger,

1914
01:26:20,217 --> 01:26:22,750
it made a last ditch effort
to keep up with the trends.

1915
01:26:23,417 --> 01:26:24,450
Yep, definitely.

1916
01:26:24,483 --> 01:26:25,917
I'm a little bit nervous
about it.

1917
01:26:25,949 --> 01:26:28,116
I do believe my father
would be 100% on board with it.

1918
01:26:28,217 --> 01:26:30,417
OMAR: But the pivot to healthy
choices was not enough

1919
01:26:30,450 --> 01:26:31,817
to keep the doors open.

1920
01:26:34,617 --> 01:26:37,617
Starting a restaurant
in the '70s, '80s, '90s

1921
01:26:37,650 --> 01:26:39,350
just seemed
to be so much simpler.

1922
01:26:39,383 --> 01:26:40,683
Definitely easier.

1923
01:26:40,717 --> 01:26:42,683
It was much easier.

1924
01:26:42,717 --> 01:26:46,284
I was thinking I'll give them
empire of restaurants,

1925
01:26:47,218 --> 01:26:49,351
so they'll do very well.

1926
01:26:49,384 --> 01:26:50,917
And my grandsons,

1927
01:26:50,950 --> 01:26:53,451
I hope that do
the same thing I did.

1928
01:26:53,484 --> 01:26:55,850
Even if 50% what I did.

1929
01:26:55,883 --> 01:26:57,451
Now it's completely different.

1930
01:26:57,484 --> 01:26:59,418
It's harder, that's for sure.

1931
01:26:59,451 --> 01:27:01,017
Everything's so over-saturated.

1932
01:27:01,050 --> 01:27:02,284
There's so many franchises now,

1933
01:27:02,318 --> 01:27:03,950
you can't even keep count
of them anymore.

1934
01:27:03,983 --> 01:27:07,218
And not to mention
costs going up.

1935
01:27:07,218 --> 01:27:09,083
It's just getting harder
and harder.

1936
01:27:09,117 --> 01:27:11,818
OMAR: It's not
just oversaturation,

1937
01:27:11,851 --> 01:27:14,784
but the hyper-industrialization
of the food industry.

1938
01:27:16,618 --> 01:27:18,984
Even if the Barons
could get their shit together,

1939
01:27:19,018 --> 01:27:21,418
they could never compete
with all the new chains

1940
01:27:21,451 --> 01:27:23,219
able to scale up
and spread globally

1941
01:27:23,219 --> 01:27:24,651
at record speed.

1942
01:27:27,018 --> 01:27:28,319
My kids were born,

1943
01:27:28,352 --> 01:27:31,485
and I was supposed
to take a year off,

1944
01:27:31,519 --> 01:27:34,385
but I didn't have the heart
to leave the kids.

1945
01:27:35,984 --> 01:27:37,018
Come on. Come on.

1946
01:27:38,219 --> 01:27:39,352
Okay.

1947
01:27:39,385 --> 01:27:40,685
You can always make more money,

1948
01:27:40,719 --> 01:27:41,852
you can't make more time.

1949
01:27:41,885 --> 01:27:43,018
And time always mattered to me

1950
01:27:43,051 --> 01:27:44,252
more than money.

1951
01:27:44,285 --> 01:27:45,919
I never did go back
to the restaurant.

1952
01:27:45,952 --> 01:27:49,985
RUDY: They got sick and tired
of selling hamburgers

1953
01:27:50,019 --> 01:27:52,519
and they wanted to spend time
with their families.

1954
01:27:52,552 --> 01:27:55,220
So I was...
I'm not gonna argue with them

1955
01:27:55,220 --> 01:27:56,752
if they want to work
something else.

1956
01:27:56,785 --> 01:27:58,919
For a few years now,
I've owned a finance company.

1957
01:27:58,952 --> 01:28:02,220
My brother and sister
ended up selling

1958
01:28:02,253 --> 01:28:05,220
and going into the corporate
world, as well, now.

1959
01:28:05,220 --> 01:28:07,752
There's good and bad
to that, you know?

1960
01:28:07,785 --> 01:28:10,719
It's good that, okay,
well, we can expand

1961
01:28:10,752 --> 01:28:13,220
to something different
and maybe better.

1962
01:28:13,220 --> 01:28:15,653
It's sad because it's kind of
like an end of an era.

1963
01:28:15,686 --> 01:28:16,753
RUDY: It's sad.

1964
01:28:16,786 --> 01:28:20,052
Everything's gonna have
an end to it.

1965
01:28:20,085 --> 01:28:22,420
This Burger Baron was like
a constant in your life?

1966
01:28:23,220 --> 01:28:24,353
Yeah, absolutely.

1967
01:28:24,386 --> 01:28:26,920
-Really?
-Yeah. It was like...

1968
01:28:26,953 --> 01:28:28,986
Pretty often. I don't know,
at least once a month.

1969
01:28:29,020 --> 01:28:31,053
-I was legitimately sad.
-Really?

1970
01:28:31,086 --> 01:28:33,486
Yeah. It was like a piece
of my childhood gone.

1971
01:28:33,520 --> 01:28:36,520
Did you feel like, "If only
I went there more often..."

1972
01:28:36,553 --> 01:28:37,753
-If only I, you know..."
-No.

1973
01:28:37,786 --> 01:28:40,354
I didn't feel
like I went there too little.

1974
01:28:40,387 --> 01:28:41,421
I think I went there

1975
01:28:41,454 --> 01:28:42,521
the maximum amount
I should have.

1976
01:28:42,553 --> 01:28:44,020
(LAUGHING)

1977
01:28:48,120 --> 01:28:50,354
DONOVAN: My niece
texts me and she says,

1978
01:28:50,387 --> 01:28:51,654
"Hey, you know
they're shutting down

1979
01:28:51,687 --> 01:28:54,053
"the Burger Baron
on the end of Whyte Avenue?"

1980
01:28:54,086 --> 01:28:56,821
And I was like, "No. Oh, no."

1981
01:28:56,854 --> 01:28:58,587
"We're gonna stop in
and we're gonna have a burger."

1982
01:28:58,621 --> 01:29:01,221
I'm talking to the owner.
He's in tears.

1983
01:29:01,221 --> 01:29:03,587
I see people coming in
and out, and they're crying.

1984
01:29:03,621 --> 01:29:04,821
And I'm like, "What the hell?

1985
01:29:04,854 --> 01:29:06,421
"This is a burger joint,
and everybody's crying?"

1986
01:29:06,454 --> 01:29:09,487
There's something going on here
that I'm not getting.

1987
01:29:09,521 --> 01:29:10,821
"Why is everybody so upset?"

1988
01:29:10,854 --> 01:29:13,587
And they're like,
"Well, that you care enough."

1989
01:29:13,621 --> 01:29:14,754
And I'm choking up.

1990
01:29:14,787 --> 01:29:16,422
As my kids and I are leaving,

1991
01:29:16,454 --> 01:29:18,887
I look and I see the sign
in my rear-view mirror

1992
01:29:18,921 --> 01:29:20,288
as we're pulling out,

1993
01:29:20,322 --> 01:29:23,222
and I stop and I'm like,
"I need to be a part of this.

1994
01:29:23,255 --> 01:29:24,588
"This is too good."

1995
01:29:26,222 --> 01:29:27,722
So, first thing, I get it home,

1996
01:29:27,754 --> 01:29:29,222
I pressure-wash it
in my backyard.

1997
01:29:29,222 --> 01:29:32,222
All I can smell is hamburgers.

1998
01:29:32,255 --> 01:29:34,954
The grease is just lifting off
with the hot water.

1999
01:29:34,987 --> 01:29:37,222
And I'm like,
"I've made the right decision."

2000
01:29:37,255 --> 01:29:38,555
Can you tell us
how much you paid for it?

2001
01:29:38,588 --> 01:29:40,722
Twenty Mushroom Burgers' worth.

2002
01:29:40,755 --> 01:29:43,288
Honestly, I think
Burger Baron is closing

2003
01:29:43,322 --> 01:29:44,788
because it's not fashionable.

2004
01:29:44,822 --> 01:29:46,788
People see the Burger Baron,

2005
01:29:46,822 --> 01:29:49,223
but they don't see
the Burger Baron.

2006
01:29:49,256 --> 01:29:50,988
They forget to appreciate

2007
01:29:51,022 --> 01:29:52,388
what it really is.

2008
01:29:52,422 --> 01:29:53,788
And it's that burger.

2009
01:29:53,822 --> 01:29:55,122
It's that logo.

2010
01:29:55,223 --> 01:29:56,955
It's that smell.

2011
01:29:56,988 --> 01:29:58,755
And even more, it's that family

2012
01:29:58,788 --> 01:30:02,256
that came from the other side
of the world.

2013
01:30:05,189 --> 01:30:06,755
OMAR: Changing consumer values

2014
01:30:06,788 --> 01:30:09,589
no doubt has a lot to do
with the closures,

2015
01:30:09,623 --> 01:30:12,223
but there's a bigger problem
they're facing.

2016
01:30:12,256 --> 01:30:16,289
The next of kin,
the Baronets and Baronetesses.

2017
01:30:16,323 --> 01:30:19,289
JUDY: I wouldn't be buying stock
in Burger Baron.

2018
01:30:19,323 --> 01:30:20,456
How many kids

2019
01:30:21,823 --> 01:30:23,956
want to work in Burger Baron,

2020
01:30:23,989 --> 01:30:25,889
take it over, run it

2021
01:30:25,923 --> 01:30:27,756
and face all the competition

2022
01:30:27,789 --> 01:30:29,324
that they have
in the drive-throughs

2023
01:30:29,356 --> 01:30:30,789
and the this and the that?

2024
01:30:30,823 --> 01:30:34,656
How many of those sons
of Burger Baron families

2025
01:30:34,689 --> 01:30:36,589
want to run a Burger Baron?

2026
01:30:36,623 --> 01:30:38,623
How many of them
can even talk their own kids

2027
01:30:38,656 --> 01:30:40,257
into working there
during the summer?

2028
01:30:40,290 --> 01:30:42,956
I played a lot of soccer
growing up,

2029
01:30:42,989 --> 01:30:44,956
and I honestly
don't remember one game

2030
01:30:44,989 --> 01:30:47,824
my parents
ever watched me play, right?

2031
01:30:47,856 --> 01:30:50,156
Because they're always
in the restaurant, they can't.

2032
01:30:50,190 --> 01:30:51,590
They're not gonna leave
the restaurant

2033
01:30:51,624 --> 01:30:53,924
at 5:00 or 6:00 during rush hour

2034
01:30:53,957 --> 01:30:56,457
to go watch a hour soccer game.

2035
01:30:56,490 --> 01:30:59,324
Even though the soccer field
is just down the road, still.

2036
01:30:59,357 --> 01:31:01,890
You're just trapped.
You're here all the time.

2037
01:31:02,824 --> 01:31:04,057
You can't get away.

2038
01:31:04,090 --> 01:31:05,557
-It's a sacrifice you're making.
-Yeah.

2039
01:31:05,590 --> 01:31:08,557
Like your family, your life,
everything, right?

2040
01:31:08,590 --> 01:31:10,225
For the restaurant.

2041
01:31:10,225 --> 01:31:12,391
It's drilled in your head

2042
01:31:12,425 --> 01:31:14,690
that you need to feel guilty

2043
01:31:14,724 --> 01:31:16,358
if you try to do anything else.

2044
01:31:16,391 --> 01:31:18,990
But with this new generation,

2045
01:31:19,024 --> 01:31:20,225
they don't have that.

2046
01:31:20,225 --> 01:31:21,725
There's hope for them.

2047
01:31:21,757 --> 01:31:22,990
JUDY: They have
their own dreams,

2048
01:31:23,024 --> 01:31:25,391
and they're not the dreams
of their parents.

2049
01:31:25,425 --> 01:31:27,325
And you only have to be
a parent and a grandparent

2050
01:31:27,358 --> 01:31:28,957
for about five minutes

2051
01:31:28,990 --> 01:31:30,558
to learn the truth of that.

2052
01:31:30,591 --> 01:31:32,891
My dream is not your dream.

2053
01:31:32,925 --> 01:31:36,791
I was in my second year
of political science,

2054
01:31:36,825 --> 01:31:38,958
and then he had
his heart attack.

2055
01:31:38,991 --> 01:31:41,226
And, you know,
especially with us,

2056
01:31:41,226 --> 01:31:44,558
it's like, I'm the only boy
in the family

2057
01:31:44,591 --> 01:31:46,991
and that's kind of
a huge responsibility

2058
01:31:47,025 --> 01:31:48,891
in Lebanese culture, especially.

2059
01:31:50,825 --> 01:31:52,658
So, I don't know,
I kind of seen it

2060
01:31:52,691 --> 01:31:57,691
as a duty of mine
to just step in.

2061
01:31:57,725 --> 01:31:59,359
My dad just had a heart attack.

2062
01:31:59,392 --> 01:32:02,726
So with that happening,

2063
01:32:03,459 --> 01:32:05,559
I know my dad

2064
01:32:05,592 --> 01:32:07,626
would sell the restaurant
yesterday if he could.

2065
01:32:08,626 --> 01:32:10,091
But the problem is my mom

2066
01:32:10,125 --> 01:32:12,726
still wants to go hard,
go at it.

2067
01:32:12,759 --> 01:32:14,592
She would sell it
if the right offer came,

2068
01:32:14,626 --> 01:32:16,592
but she doesn't want
to give it away.

2069
01:32:16,626 --> 01:32:19,792
Alexa, four minute
and 30 seconds time.

2070
01:32:19,826 --> 01:32:22,426
People who run those things
are not about give them up.

2071
01:32:23,293 --> 01:32:24,492
But they will have to

2072
01:32:25,559 --> 01:32:26,559
either give them up

2073
01:32:27,659 --> 01:32:30,260
or find somebody else
to take them over.

2074
01:32:30,293 --> 01:32:31,327
And there's the problem.

2075
01:33:04,027 --> 01:33:06,627
I remember Mom waking me up
and she's like,

2076
01:33:06,660 --> 01:33:09,228
"You need to go to work,
your dad doesn't feel well.

2077
01:33:10,027 --> 01:33:11,228
"Something is wrong.

2078
01:33:11,228 --> 01:33:12,394
We're taking him
to the hospital."

2079
01:33:13,528 --> 01:33:15,428
So I came in, I see my dad,

2080
01:33:15,461 --> 01:33:16,528
he didn't look great.

2081
01:33:16,561 --> 01:33:17,860
It wasn't long after

2082
01:33:17,893 --> 01:33:19,661
where Mom called us and said,

2083
01:33:19,694 --> 01:33:21,694
"Hey, it's pretty serious.

2084
01:33:21,728 --> 01:33:22,861
"He'd had a heart attack.

2085
01:33:22,894 --> 01:33:26,494
"They're flying him
out to Edmonton."

2086
01:33:26,528 --> 01:33:29,628
And I remember going
to the hospital,

2087
01:33:29,661 --> 01:33:31,328
and he was on the gurney there,

2088
01:33:31,361 --> 01:33:33,494
(VOICE SHAKING)
and just looking in his eyes,

2089
01:33:33,528 --> 01:33:37,628
and thinking this might be
the last time I see him.

2090
01:33:37,661 --> 01:33:39,494
And it happened
at the restaurant.

2091
01:33:40,628 --> 01:33:44,028
So, it wasn't easy to see.

2092
01:33:44,061 --> 01:33:45,295
(VOICE BREAKING) You know, it...

2093
01:33:47,462 --> 01:33:49,128
Talked to him
after they did the procedure

2094
01:33:49,229 --> 01:33:50,362
and they put some stents in him.

2095
01:33:50,395 --> 01:33:51,861
He said he felt like a new man.

2096
01:33:51,894 --> 01:33:54,028
He'd come and he'd still want
to work just as hard.

2097
01:33:54,061 --> 01:33:55,462
He'd come in at 6:00,
7:00 in the morning

2098
01:33:55,495 --> 01:33:56,795
to start organizing or cleaning

2099
01:33:56,828 --> 01:33:58,262
or doing whatever
he wanted to do.

2100
01:33:58,295 --> 01:34:00,329
OMAR: Yeah. Are you trying
to do things differently

2101
01:34:00,362 --> 01:34:02,229
from the way our parents did?

2102
01:34:02,262 --> 01:34:04,662
How are you protecting yourself
against that?

2103
01:34:04,695 --> 01:34:06,495
ALI: I don't know
if I'm protecting myself.

2104
01:34:06,529 --> 01:34:08,395
Five years ago,
we started closing on Sundays

2105
01:34:08,429 --> 01:34:11,362
to have some sort of normalcy
with the family.

2106
01:34:11,395 --> 01:34:13,230
So they don't kind of grow up

2107
01:34:13,230 --> 01:34:15,362
just knowing
the restaurant life.

2108
01:34:15,395 --> 01:34:17,495
Would you want your kids
to take over the restaurant?

2109
01:34:17,529 --> 01:34:19,495
You have big dreams
for your kids,

2110
01:34:19,529 --> 01:34:21,929
but there's nothing wrong
with the restaurant life.

2111
01:34:21,962 --> 01:34:24,762
I know it's hard.
I know it's demanding.

2112
01:34:24,795 --> 01:34:26,995
I know you're here all the time.

2113
01:34:27,029 --> 01:34:29,396
And it becomes...

2114
01:34:29,430 --> 01:34:32,496
The restaurant becomes
like a second wife

2115
01:34:32,530 --> 01:34:35,363
or a family kind of thing,
a second family.

2116
01:34:35,396 --> 01:34:36,830
No, a second wife.

2117
01:34:36,863 --> 01:34:38,029
-(LAUGHING)
-Obviously.

2118
01:34:38,062 --> 01:34:39,230
One of my four wives.

2119
01:34:40,796 --> 01:34:43,363
I know it's demanding,

2120
01:34:44,596 --> 01:34:46,030
but it's not so bad.

2121
01:34:46,730 --> 01:34:47,796
It really isn't.

2122
01:34:48,930 --> 01:34:50,830
I've been able to provide
for the family

2123
01:34:50,863 --> 01:34:53,396
in a community that I love,
that I grew up in.

2124
01:34:53,430 --> 01:34:54,430
It's what I know.

2125
01:34:55,863 --> 01:34:57,130
I guess it's what I love.

2126
01:35:14,431 --> 01:35:16,664
OMAR: Because of a popular
little burger shack

2127
01:35:16,697 --> 01:35:18,130
that went rogue,

2128
01:35:18,231 --> 01:35:20,597
we were able to secure
a future for ourselves

2129
01:35:20,631 --> 01:35:21,897
and our children,

2130
01:35:21,931 --> 01:35:23,597
reunite with our families

2131
01:35:23,631 --> 01:35:26,497
and get loved ones out
of a war zone.

2132
01:35:26,531 --> 01:35:28,964
I wondered if Jack McDonnell
ever had an idea

2133
01:35:28,997 --> 01:35:30,864
of what his true legacy
really was.

2134
01:35:32,497 --> 01:35:34,731
TERRY: He wouldn't
have realized that.

2135
01:35:34,764 --> 01:35:37,298
I'm learning
a lot right now, today.

2136
01:35:37,332 --> 01:35:40,664
I didn't know there's near
as many in the family

2137
01:35:40,697 --> 01:35:42,232
as you've suggested.

2138
01:35:42,265 --> 01:35:43,964
Like, I think that's great

2139
01:35:43,997 --> 01:35:47,131
that a group of people,
or individually,

2140
01:35:47,232 --> 01:35:49,698
they do well
because of the Burger Baron.

2141
01:36:11,532 --> 01:36:13,132
OMAR: There may not be
as many Burger Barons

2142
01:36:13,233 --> 01:36:14,299
as there used to be,

2143
01:36:14,333 --> 01:36:15,998
but were it not
for the immigrants,

2144
01:36:16,032 --> 01:36:17,965
refugees, and foreign workers,

2145
01:36:17,998 --> 01:36:19,732
there may not be
any left at all.

2146
01:36:20,499 --> 01:36:22,832
(UPBEAT SONG PLAYING)

2147
01:36:28,266 --> 01:36:29,799
OMAR: Wait, wait, wait, wait.

2148
01:36:29,833 --> 01:36:30,965
Don't you want to know

2149
01:36:30,998 --> 01:36:32,666
how the Mushroom Burger
sauce is made?

2150
01:36:32,699 --> 01:36:34,433
So, we've got Campbell's
Cream of Mushroom Soup.

2151
01:36:36,499 --> 01:36:39,533
OMAR: Oh, man, I remember
that can opener.

2152
01:36:39,566 --> 01:36:41,333
It's the same one
from when we were kids.

2153
01:36:41,366 --> 01:36:42,799
We're gonna take
our Tabasco sauce,

2154
01:36:42,833 --> 01:36:45,033
we're gonna add 10 splashes.

2155
01:36:45,066 --> 01:36:47,599
Worcestershire sauce,
we're gonna add four to it.

2156
01:36:49,234 --> 01:36:50,833
Soy sauce, a little bit more.

2157
01:36:53,334 --> 01:36:55,633
And then we're just
gonna mix it up.

2158
01:36:55,666 --> 01:36:57,699
OMAR: So, really, it's just
these four ingredients?

2159
01:36:57,733 --> 01:36:59,500
ALI: This is it.
There's not much to it.

2160
01:36:59,534 --> 01:37:02,234
OMAR: No cumin, no sumac,
no Lebanese spices?

2161
01:37:02,267 --> 01:37:04,367
ALI: Not a single
Lebanese spice.

2162
01:37:04,400 --> 01:37:06,467
-(OMAR LAUGHS)
-It's not a pretty sauce,

2163
01:37:06,500 --> 01:37:08,634
but it tastes fantastic
on that burger.

2164
01:37:08,667 --> 01:37:09,867
* Burger Baron

2165
01:37:11,467 --> 01:37:14,033
* We're the hot spot
right here in town

2166
01:37:14,066 --> 01:37:17,067
* People know our value
for miles around

2167
01:37:17,099 --> 01:37:19,867
* At Burger Baron
you'll be amazed

2168
01:37:19,900 --> 01:37:22,534
* We'll take you back
to the good old days

2169
01:37:22,567 --> 01:37:23,734
* Great big burgers

2170
01:37:23,767 --> 01:37:25,268
* And delicious fries

2171
01:37:25,300 --> 01:37:26,400
* We offer so much

2172
01:37:26,434 --> 01:37:28,368
* You won't believe your eyes

2173
01:37:28,400 --> 01:37:29,434
* You're gonna love

2174
01:37:29,467 --> 01:37:31,301
* What we do for you

2175
01:37:31,335 --> 01:37:32,967
* We're serving value

2176
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:34,667
* At Burger Baron
