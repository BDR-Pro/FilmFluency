Our people looked into it.

They tell us the gas pipe
was tampered with in that sewer.

502
00:31:16,219 --> 00:31:18,763
- Wasn't me.
- That job did come in.

503
00:31:18,846 --> 00:31:21,391
- But... but we rejected it.
- Yeah, we did.

504
00:31:21,474 --> 00:31:23,142
Was it last Thursday, you say?

505
00:31:24,811 --> 00:31:27,939
- We got an alibi.
- That was your birthday, wasn't it, mate?

506
00:31:28,022 --> 00:31:30,108
- Twenty-one again.
- That's right.

507
00:31:30,191 --> 00:31:32,360
I think we were in one of your clubs,
to be honest.

508

Your security cameras
can probably clear us.

509

- Coincidence, huh?
- What's the name of that club again, Fred?

510
00:31:38,491 --> 00:31:42,328
- The Sparkling Clam.
- The Sparkling Clam, that was it, yeah.

511
00:31:42,412 --> 00:31:44,831
It even sounds like
a bloody yeast infection.

512

You know, the one with the big heifer
singing on the stage.

513

- I think so, yeah.
- For now.

that may be and I want you to kill them.

Easy, lads, I come in peace.
We're all on the same team.

662
00:40:54,996 --> 00:40:56,748
You need to get him out of here, quick!

663
00:40:56,831 --> 00:40:59,167
We don't need your help,
you English prick.

664
00:40:59,251 --> 00:41:00,252
You do, actually, mate,

665
00:41:00,335 --> 00:41:02,254
this tone-deaf joke's
got a tracking device on him

666
00:41:02,337 --> 00:41:05,966
and a gaggle of assassins about
to turn up, kill every last one of you.

667
00:41:06,049 --> 00:41:08,885
Of course he has, you idiot.
It's in his watch.

668
00:41:08,969 --> 00:41:11,263
How else do you think
we keep track of him?

669
00:41:11,346 --> 00:41:14,641
- He's had it since he was a bambino.
- Look, it's a burning fuse now, mate.

670
00:41:14,724 --> 00:41:16,142
You need to get rid of it.

671
00:41:16,226 --> 00:41:17,686
[music stops]

672
00:41:17,769 --> 00:41:19,312
[Dante yells]

673
00:41:19,396 --> 00:41:22,899
Who the fuck do you think you are, eh?
Dickhead.

674
00:41:22,983 --> 00:41:26,695
You're the fucking hired help.
This watch, yeah, it's a classic.

675
00:41:26,778 --> 00:41:29,948
One of a kind.
I would die before I take it off.

676
00:41:30,448 --> 00:41:32,158
So up your fucking arsehole.

677
00:41:33,326 --> 00:41:34,619
Take the watch and destroy it.

678
00:41:34,703 --> 00:41:36,453
- What the fuck did I just say?
- Good call.

679
00:41:36,537 --> 00:41:38,038
Who you think you all are?

680
00:41:38,956 --> 00:41:40,249
You fucking...

681
00:41:50,676 --> 00:41:51,552
[grunts]

682
00:41:53,053 --> 00:41:54,680
[groans] Problem solved.

683
00:41:55,681 --> 00:41:57,558
[machine gun firing]

684
00:41:58,475 --> 00:41:59,476
[explosion]

685
00:42:07,026 --> 00:42:09,028
[suspenseful music playing]

686
00:42:29,089 --> 00:42:32,217
[Mike]
<i>Freya du Preeze, the Angel of Death.</i>

687
00:42:32,301 --> 00:42:34,636
<i>Recruited in Johannesburg by Interpol</i>

688
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:38,557
<i>and trained in the dark arts
by those who think James Bond is a muppet.</i>

689
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:39,475
Move!

690
00:42:39,558 --> 00:42:41,559
[dramatic music playing]

691
00:42:51,527 --> 00:42:52,695
Freeze!

692
00:42:57,784 --> 00:42:59,786
[tense music playing]

693
00:43:06,209 --> 00:43:08,211
[dramatic music playing]

694
00:43:17,178 --> 00:43:19,263
So stop... [yells]

695
00:43:39,075 --> 00:43:41,369
- Freya.
- Fallon.

696
00:43:42,203 --> 00:43:44,288
- Been a while.
- Like five years, I reckon.

697
00:43:45,331 --> 00:43:46,581
Russia, wasn't it?

698
00:43:48,291 --> 00:43:50,877
You stole that dirty politician
from me, eh?

699
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:54,297
You know what it's like.
First come, first served.

700
00:43:55,715 --> 00:43:59,177
I've always respected you, Fallon.
You're a damn good assassin.

701
00:43:59,261 --> 00:44:04,015
But if it's a choice between killing you
or 9 million in my bank,

702
00:44:05,016 --> 00:44:06,268
[speaks in foreign language]

703
00:44:06,351 --> 00:44:08,270
[in English]
I'm afraid that's no choice at all.

704
00:44:08,770 --> 00:44:10,313
This one's personal to me, Freya.

705
00:44:11,064 --> 00:44:16,027
So, as a professional courtesy,
I'm going to need to ask you to fuck off.

706
00:44:17,070 --> 00:44:21,241
I can't fuck off,
but I can fuck you up. [yells]

707
00:44:21,324 --> 00:44:23,326
[dramatic music playing]

708
00:44:58,027 --> 00:45:00,821
Okay, Freya, really nice seeing you again.

709
00:45:01,447 --> 00:45:03,115
I think we should call it a day,
don't you?

710
00:45:10,956 --> 00:45:11,832
I see.

711
00:45:12,833 --> 00:45:14,835
[dramatic music playing]

712
00:46:52,724 --> 00:46:56,227
- Jesus Christ!
- Well, move your fucking head then.

713
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:21,084
Please, please, please.
I'll make you rich.

714
00:47:21,168 --> 00:47:22,169
Please!

715
00:47:27,341 --> 00:47:29,259
Fuck. Fuck!

716
00:47:31,428 --> 00:47:32,262
Fuck.

717
00:47:35,766 --> 00:47:38,018
[whimpers, then screams]

718
00:47:38,727 --> 00:47:39,561
Fuck.

719
00:47:41,438 --> 00:47:43,023
Fucking out of order.

720
00:47:43,106 --> 00:47:48,236
- Oh, God! What the fuck is going on?
- Come here!

721
00:47:48,945 --> 00:47:52,032
- [ominous music playing]
- [cell phone buzzes]

722
00:47:52,115 --> 00:47:55,369
- [Zuuzer] <i>Mr. Fallon, do you have my son?</i>
- [Mike] I've got him, yeah.

723
00:47:55,452 --> 00:47:58,872
But it proper kicked off back there,
and your entire security team got wasted.

724
00:47:59,498 --> 00:48:01,583
- Is he okay?
- Oh, he's fine, yeah.

725
00:48:01,666 --> 00:48:04,211
Apart from the fact he just decided
to swallow his own watch.

726
00:48:04,294 --> 00:48:05,670
Unless I cut it out of his guts,

727
00:48:05,754 --> 00:48:08,839
he's gonna be a walking target
till he pinches off his next loaf.

728
00:48:08,923 --> 00:48:11,634
- When was the last time you took a shit?
- None of your business.

729
00:48:12,802 --> 00:48:14,887
Is that my Mamma?
I want to talk to her. Mamma!

730
00:48:16,263 --> 00:48:20,017
I need you to protect my son at all costs.
Do you understand?

731
00:48:20,101 --> 00:48:21,894
Listen.
I ain't a fuckin' babysitter, okay?

732
00:48:21,977 --> 00:48:24,105
I'm a professional killer.

733
00:48:24,188 --> 00:48:27,775
And with all due respect, Mrs. Zuuzer,
your son is an absolute twat.

734
00:48:27,858 --> 00:48:28,901
We ain't gonna gel.

735
00:48:28,984 --> 00:48:31,946
Mamma! This arsehole
just punched me in the face...

736
00:48:32,029 --> 00:48:33,697
You don't need to get along.

737
00:48:33,781 --> 00:48:37,701
You just need to neutralize the threats
and keep him alive.

738
00:48:37,785 --> 00:48:40,079
You'll be lucky if I don't kill
this prick myself.

739
00:48:40,162 --> 00:48:43,499
If you ever want to see your friend again,
you won't make that mistake.

740
00:48:45,334 --> 00:48:51,090
Bring him back to me in one piece.
Do we have a deal, Mr. Accident Man?

741
00:48:52,508 --> 00:48:54,677
- All right, fine.
- Then it's done.

742
00:48:58,431 --> 00:49:00,474
- Come here.
- What are you doing?

743
00:49:00,558 --> 00:49:03,018
Take me to my Mamma.
She's the only one who can protect me.

744
00:49:03,102 --> 00:49:04,311
Listen to me, you idiot.

745
00:49:04,395 --> 00:49:06,564
Your mummy just hired me
to protect you, okay?

746
00:49:06,647 --> 00:49:09,775
- So you do as you're fucking told.
- You... you... you...

747
00:49:09,859 --> 00:49:11,652
you are a fucking ugly troll.

748
00:49:12,319 --> 00:49:16,448
Anybody ever tell you that, yeah, you look
like a fucking melted Ben Affleck?

749
00:49:16,531 --> 00:49:19,784
I'll tell my mamma how you treated me
and you're gonna pay for your actions.

750
00:49:19,868 --> 00:49:22,745
She knows exactly how
to treat a man like you.

751
00:49:22,829 --> 00:49:27,459
- And if you strike me one more time...
- Oh, Jesus.

752
00:49:27,542 --> 00:49:28,710
What you doing here?

753
00:49:28,793 --> 00:49:31,129
- We haven't got the time to buy a shampoo.
- Shut up!

754
00:49:32,172 --> 00:49:33,923
- Laxatives, you got any?
- Yeah.

755
00:49:34,466 --> 00:49:36,759
- Well, give it to me. Come on, let's go!
- Here.

756
00:49:36,843 --> 00:49:39,220
- What the fuck are you doing? You...
- Shut up.

757
00:49:40,597 --> 00:49:41,473
Ugh!

758
00:49:43,892 --> 00:49:45,602
You... What the... You...

759
00:49:50,690 --> 00:49:55,737
- In one end, out the other, hey, mate?
- Just take me home, boy.

760
00:49:56,863 --> 00:49:58,823
You call me boy one more time,
I swear to God,

761
00:49:58,907 --> 00:49:59,824
I'm gonna kill you.

762
00:49:59,908 --> 00:50:02,702
I'll worry about killing your old mother
when the time comes.

763
00:50:02,785 --> 00:50:05,079
- You understand?
- Take me to my mamma.

764
00:50:05,163 --> 00:50:07,415
Take me to my mamma! Take me...

765
00:50:13,546 --> 00:50:14,589
I'm gonna...

766
00:50:17,091 --> 00:50:17,926
[burps]

767
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:21,929
- You got a back way out of his place?
- Yeah. There.

768
00:50:22,012 --> 00:50:24,681
- Come here. Let's go. Keep moving.
- Get the fuck off me.

769
00:50:25,807 --> 00:50:28,310
Please, just give me five minutes.
I cannot breathe.

770
00:50:29,228 --> 00:50:31,480
I've got asthma, probably. Please.

771
00:50:31,563 --> 00:50:33,982
- Hello? Are you listening to me?
- All right, shut up!

772
00:50:34,816 --> 00:50:36,652
[dramatic music playing]

773
00:50:47,579 --> 00:50:49,581
[Mike] <i>Now this is the great Yendi...</i>

774
00:50:50,457 --> 00:50:53,961
<i>born in Ghana,
named after the town he was abandoned in.</i>

775
00:50:54,044 --> 00:50:56,129
<i>He sells himself as a sodding vampire,</i>

776
00:50:56,213 --> 00:50:58,840
<i>but essentially he's just
a fuckin' butcher.</i>

777
00:51:01,218 --> 00:51:04,596
- This Freya's blood?
- Most of it.

778
00:51:06,223 --> 00:51:09,184
- B Positive.
- Always try to be, pal.

779
00:51:09,268 --> 00:51:12,563
Foolish boy, B Positive is rare.

780
00:51:13,397 --> 00:51:17,109
Only about eight percent,
but not the rarest.

781
00:51:17,192 --> 00:51:18,443
What type you rockin'?

782
00:51:18,527 --> 00:51:21,196
Last time I checked,
high bloody octane, mate.

783
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:24,156
Please kill him
and my mamma will make you rich.

784
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:25,575
It does not work like that.

785
00:51:25,658 --> 00:51:29,287
It works the way I say it works.

786
00:51:33,457 --> 00:51:34,500
Stay there.

787
00:51:34,584 --> 00:51:36,377
I'm looking forward to killing him

788
00:51:37,503 --> 00:51:40,172
but I will savor that one
till I'm done with you.

789
00:51:48,639 --> 00:51:50,516
- Get up!
- Fucking...

790
00:51:55,479 --> 00:51:56,314
This way.

791
00:52:10,661 --> 00:52:11,871
Fuck this.

792
00:52:29,054 --> 00:52:30,055
Get up there.

793
00:52:31,473 --> 00:52:35,852
- Get up there!
- Push me, you fucking... Push me.

794
00:52:35,935 --> 00:52:40,148
- [Mike] Fucking get up there, you dum-dum.
- [Dante] I'm fucking trying. [grunting]

795
00:52:41,191 --> 00:52:42,025
Push!

796
00:52:44,444 --> 00:52:46,529
- Use your arms, get up.
- I'm using my arms.

797
00:52:46,613 --> 00:52:49,157
What do you think I'm using, my teeth?
Fuck!

798
00:52:51,117 --> 00:52:53,870
Going to taste your blood.

799
00:53:08,093 --> 00:53:10,679
Help! Help!

800
00:53:10,762 --> 00:53:12,430
Dum-dum, where are you?

801
00:53:15,725 --> 00:53:19,854
There's a fucking maniac
with an axe trying to kill me.

802
00:53:19,938 --> 00:53:21,773
- Somebody get...
- Come here.

803
00:53:24,317 --> 00:53:28,321
Right, just get in here and you stay
in there if you know what's good for you.

804
00:53:28,405 --> 00:53:29,322
Look, I'm scared...

805
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:34,076
[dramatic music playing]

806
00:55:18,596 --> 00:55:19,806
Let me know how this tastes.

807
00:55:35,863 --> 00:55:37,490
Nice and tasty?

808
00:55:37,573 --> 00:55:39,742
AB negative.

809
00:55:41,661 --> 00:55:44,288
The rarest and finest of them all.

810
00:55:45,330 --> 00:55:46,456
What, me or you?

811
00:55:47,499 --> 00:55:52,504
I... am unique, a less than one percenter.

812
00:55:53,797 --> 00:55:55,924
You're a common, dirty boy.

813
00:55:56,508 --> 00:55:57,467
Ah.

814
00:55:58,885 --> 00:56:00,804
- Shall I finish you off then?
- No...

815
00:56:03,056 --> 00:56:06,101
Let a brother bleed.

816
00:56:07,185 --> 00:56:09,187
Go on then. Off you pop.

817
00:56:10,397 --> 00:56:11,398
[groans]

818
00:56:19,281 --> 00:56:20,115
Is he dead?

819
00:56:24,911 --> 00:56:25,745
He is now.

820
00:56:27,831 --> 00:56:28,707
So what now, eh?

821
00:56:29,958 --> 00:56:31,418
So, what are we doing now, idjota?

822
00:56:32,127 --> 00:56:34,004
Idjota. I'm guessing that means idiot.

823
00:56:34,087 --> 00:56:36,089
Why don't we put that
on the same list as "boy"?

824
00:56:36,715 --> 00:56:38,341
I'm handling things. Come here.

825
00:56:39,467 --> 00:56:43,013
Siu-Ling, when you get this message,
I need you to do me a favor.

826
00:56:43,096 --> 00:56:46,308
There's a karaoke bar off Strait Street,
I need you to pick up my bike.

827
00:56:48,894 --> 00:56:51,145
This whole place
was drilled into the side of a cliff,

828
00:56:51,228 --> 00:56:53,063
