00:04:09,858 --> 00:04:11,927
Hi Michael, it's
Linda from Manhattan Realty.

2
00:04:11,947 --> 00:04:14,384
Congratulations on selling the apartment.

3
00:04:14,428 --> 00:04:16,192
Sorry we couldn't get your asking price,

4
00:04:16,212 --> 00:04:17,832
but selling any two-bedroom on the

5
00:04:17,866 --> 00:04:20,390
Upper West Side in this
market is a victory.

6
00:04:20,434 --> 00:04:21,565
You should feel great.

7
00:04:21,609 --> 00:04:24,046
Good luck in your new place.

8
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:53,118
Can you spare some change miss, miss?

9
00:04:53,162 --> 00:04:54,362
Please?

10
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,430
Excuse me, can you spare
some change, please, sir?

11
00:05:00,474 --> 00:05:01,344
Sorry, bro.

12
00:05:01,388 --> 00:05:03,215
I bet you are.

13
00:05:03,259 --> 00:05:04,434
It's Christmas time and you can't

14
00:05:04,478 --> 00:05:07,132
spare not even a quarter, right?

15
00:05:07,176 --> 00:05:09,178
I am $600,000 in debt.

16
00:05:10,484 --> 00:05:11,684
Damn.

17
00:05:12,355 --> 00:05:14,444
You want some sticky rice?

18
00:05:14,488 --> 00:05:15,688
No, thanks.

19
00:05:16,403 --> 00:05:18,013
Excuse me.

20
00:05:18,056 --> 00:05:21,016
I'm sorry to bother you, but,
um, are you Michael Shiver?

21
00:05:21,059 --> 00:05:21,973
Yeah.

22
00:05:22,017 --> 00:05:23,453
Oh, my god!

23
00:05:23,497 --> 00:05:24,697
I loved Fall.

24
00:05:26,195 --> 00:05:28,023
I must have read it like 10 times

25
00:05:28,066 --> 00:05:29,807
my senior year in high school.

26
00:05:29,851 --> 00:05:31,374
Thanks.

27
00:05:31,418 --> 00:05:33,514
Why haven't you written
another book since?

28
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:35,335
I did, two actually.

29
00:05:37,424 --> 00:05:38,729
Oh.

30
00:05:38,773 --> 00:05:40,078
Okay.

31
00:05:40,122 --> 00:05:41,843
I don't mean to be rude, but I got to,

32
00:05:41,863 --> 00:05:43,255
I got to go, so.

33
00:05:43,299 --> 00:05:46,694
Okay, thank you for writing those books.

34
00:05:49,392 --> 00:05:52,830
Did they wind up together in the end?

35
00:05:52,874 --> 00:05:55,877
It's so ambiguous, it always killed me.

36
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,661
What do you think?

37
00:05:57,705 --> 00:06:00,185
I think they did.

38
00:06:00,229 --> 00:06:02,231
Then I guess they did.

39
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:53,777
How is your new manuscript
selling, by the way?

40
00:07:53,821 --> 00:07:54,996
It's not, it's not.

41
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:56,368
Publishers are not interested.

42
00:07:56,388 --> 00:07:59,304
There's still a couple
more we're out to but,

43
00:07:59,348 --> 00:08:00,610
I'm just over it, okay?

44
00:08:00,654 --> 00:08:02,200
I'm done, if the book doesn't sell.

45
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:03,637
I refuse to write the kinds of books

46
00:08:03,657 --> 00:08:05,682
that the kinds of people
who buy books want to read.

47
00:08:05,702 --> 00:08:07,182
You know what you should do?

48
00:08:07,225 --> 00:08:08,792
Oh, my God, I'm a genius.

49
00:08:08,836 --> 00:08:09,532
What?

50
00:08:09,576 --> 00:08:11,403
Come to Paris.

51
00:08:11,447 --> 00:08:13,536
I have a nice apartment in Montmartre.

52
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:14,494
Just come.

53
00:08:14,537 --> 00:08:16,974
You'll get a new perspective.

54
00:08:17,018 --> 00:08:18,367
I don't know.

55
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:22,438
I haven't been back to Paris
since Sarah and I broke up.

56
00:08:22,458 --> 00:08:25,722
Oh, I mean, it's high time
you exorcized your demons!

57
00:08:25,766 --> 00:08:29,204
For God's sakes, man, that
was, what, 15 years ago?

58
00:08:29,247 --> 00:08:32,033
You'll be fine, you're in a funk.

59
00:08:32,076 --> 00:08:34,644
Okay Mike, I'm sorry, but I got to go.

60
00:08:34,688 --> 00:08:36,341
Come to Paris, okay?

61
00:08:36,385 --> 00:08:37,585
Just come.

62
00:08:48,049 --> 00:08:52,183
God's presence has always
been undeniable in my life.

63
00:08:52,227 --> 00:08:54,534
It's my presence that
has often been suspect.

64
00:13:41,733 --> 00:13:43,823
Mom, Michael's here from the States.

65
00:13:43,866 --> 00:13:45,128
What's that chérie.

66
00:13:45,172 --> 00:13:46,390
Michael!

67
00:13:46,434 --> 00:13:48,001
I don't believe it, you came.

68
00:13:48,044 --> 00:13:49,872
I did, I did, I came.

69
00:13:49,916 --> 00:13:51,352
What are you doing here?

70
00:13:51,395 --> 00:13:53,203
He invited me, and I
figured I'd surprise you guys.

71
00:13:53,223 --> 00:13:55,747
He was depressed, so
I told him to come over.

72
00:13:55,791 --> 00:13:57,164
He's staying at my father's studio.

73
00:13:57,184 --> 00:13:58,359
How great.

74
00:13:58,402 --> 00:13:59,316
You can keep him company on the nights

75
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,970
I kick him out of the house.

76
00:14:01,014 --> 00:14:01,841
Just kidding.

77
00:14:01,884 --> 00:14:03,407
How great to see you!

78
00:14:03,451 --> 00:14:05,366
It's great to see you.

79
00:14:19,206 --> 00:14:20,860
This place is amazing.

80
00:14:20,903 --> 00:14:22,103
Yeah.

81
00:14:22,774 --> 00:14:25,255
My father bought it in the 40s.

82
00:14:25,299 --> 00:14:27,867
He used it as kind of an office.

83
00:14:28,955 --> 00:14:31,000
I'm glad you came.

84
00:14:31,044 --> 00:14:34,917
I think it's going to
be really good for you.

85
00:14:34,961 --> 00:14:36,161
I hope so.

86
00:14:48,061 --> 00:14:49,584
All right.

87
00:14:49,627 --> 00:14:53,240
So, you have a little shop down
there for fruits and water.

88
00:14:53,283 --> 00:14:54,371
Okay.

89
00:14:54,415 --> 00:14:56,417
Sacré Coeur is just up there.

90
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:57,940
Yeah.

91
00:14:57,984 --> 00:14:59,443
And Lamarck-Caulaincourt
will be your metro.

92
00:14:59,463 --> 00:15:00,638
You remember?

93
00:15:00,682 --> 00:15:01,944
Doesn't matter.

94
00:15:01,988 --> 00:15:03,230
Paris is the only place you can be lost

95
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:05,600
and found at the same time.

96
00:15:06,993 --> 00:15:09,038
Thanks so much for having me, Charles.

97
00:15:09,082 --> 00:15:10,387
I really appreciate it.

98
00:15:10,431 --> 00:15:11,432
It's great to see you.

99
00:15:11,475 --> 00:15:12,563
It's a pleasure, buddy.

100
00:15:12,607 --> 00:15:13,434
Yeah, I'll see you soon.

101
00:15:13,477 --> 00:15:14,217
Have fun.

102
00:15:14,261 --> 00:15:15,044
Bye.

103
00:15:15,088 --> 00:15:16,045
You take care.

104
00:15:16,089 --> 00:15:17,289
Okay.

105
00:17:09,724 --> 00:17:11,030
Oh, oh, it's not mine.

106
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:14,511
No, but I didn't drop it.

107
00:17:14,555 --> 00:17:16,165
God wants you to have it.

108
00:17:16,209 --> 00:17:17,949
You know, it's your lucky day.

109
00:17:17,993 --> 00:17:19,212
Welcome to Paris.

110
00:17:20,604 --> 00:17:23,390
You know, I hate to ask,
but do you a few Euro's,

111
00:17:23,433 --> 00:17:26,045
I can get something to eat?

112
00:17:26,088 --> 00:17:27,568
Yeah, yeah, sure.

113
00:17:27,611 --> 00:17:29,091
You're very kind.

114
00:17:29,135 --> 00:17:31,093
God picked the right man to grace.

115
00:17:31,137 --> 00:17:32,877
Take this but also, take the ring.

116
00:17:32,921 --> 00:17:33,617
Take the ring.

117
00:17:33,661 --> 00:17:34,575
No.

118
00:17:34,618 --> 00:17:35,532
You can, you can sell it.

119
00:17:35,576 --> 00:17:36,707
No, that was meant for you.

120
00:17:36,751 --> 00:17:38,057
It was at your feet.

121
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,623
It's a lady's ring anyway.

122
00:17:39,667 --> 00:17:42,191
Well, then, give it to a lady.

123
00:17:42,235 --> 00:17:44,106
I wish I had one to give it to.

124
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:46,413
You will have one soon now.

125
00:18:35,331 --> 00:18:36,531
You're strict.

126
00:18:37,855 --> 00:18:41,163
How do you say you're strict
in French, you're strict?

127
00:18:43,339 --> 00:18:44,688
You're hard.

128
00:18:44,732 --> 00:18:47,126
You're, like, you're strict
with the little doggy.

129
00:18:53,175 --> 00:18:54,678
Is that how you are
when you have a boyfriend,

130
00:18:54,698 --> 00:18:58,311
like when you're in love,
like with a, with a boyfriend.

131
00:18:58,354 --> 00:18:59,399
Strict?

132
00:18:59,442 --> 00:19:01,062
You discipline him hard like that?

133
00:19:07,842 --> 00:19:09,215
I don't know what you're saying to me,

134
00:19:09,235 --> 00:19:12,020
but I could watch you say it forever.

135
00:19:12,063 --> 00:19:13,263
Okay.

136
00:19:21,769 --> 00:19:22,969
Wait, wait.

137
00:19:24,511 --> 00:19:25,711
Ma'am.

138
00:19:29,559 --> 00:19:32,345
So, how much are those oranges?

139
00:22:37,573 --> 00:22:38,773
No, no, no!

140
00:22:52,719 --> 00:22:56,897
No, no, no.

141
00:26:26,367 --> 00:26:27,455
Do you speak English?

142
00:26:27,498 --> 00:26:28,978
Downstairs.

143
00:26:34,375 --> 00:26:35,811
I'm so sorry I'm late.

144
00:26:35,855 --> 00:26:38,727
It's polite to say hello
when you first see someone.

145
00:26:38,771 --> 00:26:39,902
Oh, excuse me.

146
00:26:39,946 --> 00:26:41,643
Hello, I'm Michael.

147
00:26:42,949 --> 00:26:45,255
Hello, Michael, I'm Natalie.

148
00:26:45,299 --> 00:26:46,430
Have a seat, please.

149
00:26:46,474 --> 00:26:47,674
Thank you.

150
00:26:52,959 --> 00:26:55,657
Big, fancy American writer!

151
00:26:55,701 --> 00:26:58,660
You don't look very fancy now, do you?

152
00:26:58,704 --> 00:27:01,445
You look puny and small.

153
00:27:01,489 --> 00:27:02,838
You're pathetic.

154
00:27:04,144 --> 00:27:06,755
You're lucky I would pay
any attention to you at all,

155
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:10,106
even to use you for my enjoyment.

156
00:27:10,150 --> 00:27:12,718
No money, no career, no woman.

157
00:27:15,851 --> 00:27:18,724
You used to be beloved, didn't you?

158
00:27:21,901 --> 00:27:26,296
But no one cares about
your books anymore.

159
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:27,689
Your time is past.

160
00:27:28,908 --> 00:27:32,172
I want to read some fresh, young authors,

161
00:27:33,434 --> 00:27:36,611
not deluded, self-obsessed narcissists.

162
00:27:37,743 --> 00:27:39,594
There's a big difference
between you thinking

163
00:27:39,614 --> 00:27:44,184
your life is interesting and
anyone else thinking it is.

164
00:27:47,187 --> 00:27:50,016
And let me assure you, no one does.

165
00:28:02,768 --> 00:28:04,160
There you go.

166
00:28:04,204 --> 00:28:05,684
Merci, Michael.

167
00:28:06,902 --> 00:28:08,817
How far would you go?

168
00:28:08,861 --> 00:28:10,036
What do you mean?

169
00:28:10,079 --> 00:28:12,081
Like, hurting somebody.

170
00:28:12,125 --> 00:28:14,431
I would never injure someone forever.

171
00:28:14,475 --> 00:28:18,087
I wouldn't cut their balls
off, if that's what you mean.

172
00:28:18,131 --> 00:28:22,570
Only pain, but it goes away,
a couple of days or so.

173
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:25,771
Are there dominatrixes
that will go farther?

174
00:28:25,791 --> 00:28:27,183
Of course.

175
00:28:27,227 --> 00:28:28,881
Like, kill someone?

176
00:28:31,579 --> 00:28:33,407
No, of course not.

177
00:28:33,450 --> 00:28:36,192
That's not BDSM, that's murder.

178
00:28:36,236 --> 00:28:38,847
So you never heard of anyone like that?

179
00:28:38,891 --> 00:28:41,241
I heard of one crazy
girl who would do this.

180
00:28:41,284 --> 00:28:42,895
I don't know if it's true.

181
00:28:42,938 --> 00:28:44,418
Really?

182
00:28:44,461 --> 00:28:45,898
Wow.

183
00:28:45,941 --> 00:28:47,141
Yeah.

184
00:28:49,466 --> 00:28:50,903
Hi, Michael, it's Charles.

185
00:28:50,946 --> 00:28:52,382
Hope you're comfortable.

186
00:28:52,426 --> 00:28:53,732
Caroline and the kids want

187
00:28:53,775 --> 00:28:55,583
to make sure you're coming for Christmas.

188
00:28:55,603 --> 00:28:57,648
No excuses, see you then.

189
00:28:58,606 --> 00:29:00,739
End of new messages.

190
00:29:00,782 --> 00:29:03,219
To listen to your messages, press one.

191
00:29:03,263 --> 00:29:04,960
To send a message...

192
00:29:45,566 --> 00:29:46,939
Look, I'm, I'm sorry, I'm really late.

193
00:29:46,959 --> 00:29:49,700
Do you mind if I take the bike?

194
00:29:51,833 --> 00:29:53,033
Please.

195
00:29:54,227 --> 00:29:56,470
You're, you didn't, I
don't know if you remember.

196
00:29:56,490 --> 00:29:58,971
We met last night in this little bodega.

197
00:29:59,014 --> 00:29:59,841
The orange store.

198
00:29:59,885 --> 00:30:01,016
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

199
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:01,930
I remember.

200
00:30:01,974 --> 00:30:03,932
You had the little dog, yeah.

201
00:30:03,976 --> 00:30:06,500
You, you didn't, you didn't,

202
00:30:06,543 --> 00:30:08,003
I don't, I'm not, I was
jet-lagged I don't know,

203
00:30:08,023 --> 00:30:10,571
but I don't remember you
really speaking English at all,

204
00:30:10,591 --> 00:30:11,331
certainly not this well.

205
00:30:11,374 --> 00:30:13,115
Did you, did you?

206
00:30:13,159 --> 00:30:16,989
So, what did you want
to do with the bike?

207
00:30:20,166 --> 00:30:21,994
I'll give you a ride.

208
00:30:23,256 --> 00:30:26,912
Just get in the basket,
I'll give you a lift.

209
00:30:28,261 --> 00:30:30,872
So, what's your name?

210
00:30:30,916 --> 00:30:32,116
I'm Michael.

211
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:36,205
Why don't we cancel our plans
and just go have dinner?

212
00:30:36,225 --> 00:30:37,705
What do you say?

213
00:30:38,924 --> 00:30:39,838
Come on, it's the fun of being big,

214
00:30:39,881 --> 00:30:41,230
we can do whatever we want.

215
00:30:41,274 --> 00:30:43,343
Yeah, but we have to
deal with the consequences.

216
00:30:43,363 --> 00:30:44,668
Oh, come on.

217
00:30:44,712 --> 00:30:46,128
If your friends are good friends,

218
00:30:46,148 --> 00:30:47,323
they're gonna be more excited
about this great story

219
00:30:47,367 --> 00:30:48,696
of our first date than pissed off

220
00:30:48,716 --> 00:30:49,412
that you canceled at the last minute.

221
00:30:49,456 --> 00:30:50,718
I mean, who cares?

222
00:30:50,761 --> 00:30:52,352
How'd you know I'm meeting friends?

223
00:30:52,372 --> 00:30:54,156
Are you meeting your boyfriend?

224
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:54,983
Why would I tell you?

225
00:30:55,027 --> 00:30:56,332
You're a stranger.

226
00:30:56,376 --> 00:30:57,705
Yeah, who you're riding in the basket

227
00:30:57,725 --> 00:30:58,900
of your bicycle like
fucking Julie Andrews

228
00:30:58,944 --> 00:31:02,077
in The Sound of Music or some shit.

229
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:05,385
You don't have a boyfriend.

230
00:31:05,428 --> 00:31:06,865
Why not?

231
00:31:06,908 --> 00:31:08,997
Because you're smiling.

232
00:31:09,041 --> 00:31:11,347
Just a little, but you're smiling.

233
00:31:11,391 --> 00:31:12,783
I don't think so.

234
00:31:12,827 --> 00:31:13,697
Yes, you are.

235
00:31:13,741 --> 00:31:14,916
Grimacing a bit, maybe.

236
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:18,006
I don't think so.

237
00:31:18,050 --> 00:31:19,250
Okay.

238
00:31:22,968 --> 00:31:25,579
So, walk two blocks that way.

239
00:31:25,622 --> 00:31:26,928
Two blocks up there?

240
00:31:26,972 --> 00:31:28,214
Yeah, and you'll find your street.

241
00:31:28,234 --> 00:31:29,104
Wait a minute, wait a
minute, wait a minute!

242
00:31:29,148 --> 00:31:30,348
What's your number?

243
00:31:30,976 --> 00:31:32,176
Let me call you.

244
00:31:33,065 --> 00:31:34,542
No, come on, let me call you.

245
00:31:35,241 --> 00:31:36,024
Come on, it's hard to
meet people you like.

246
00:31:36,068 --> 00:31:36,720
Yeah, exactly.

247
00:31:36,764 --> 00:31:37,964
Come on!

248
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:40,681
What's your number?

249
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:29,110
Listen.

250
00:34:29,154 --> 00:34:31,243
I think it's absolutely adorable

251
00:34:31,286 --> 00:34:32,833
that you have a little crush on me,

252
00:34:32,853 --> 00:34:34,139
but I think at this point, I mean,

253
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:35,662
you should just summon the courage

254
00:34:35,682 --> 00:34:37,379
to ask me out on a proper date.

255
00:34:37,423 --> 00:34:38,728
Come on.

256
00:34:38,772 --> 00:34:40,252
Stalking me?

257
00:34:40,295 --> 00:34:41,818
It's really not cool.

258
00:34:41,862 --> 00:34:44,482
How do you say stalking me
is really not cool in French?

259
00:34:44,517 --> 00:34:47,128
What's headstand called in Sanskrit?

260
00:34:47,172 --> 00:34:49,391
Can I, Can I just,
this is the only space.

261
00:34:49,435 --> 00:34:50,740
Can I, do you mind?

262
00:34:50,784 --> 00:34:52,264
Is there room here?

263
00:34:52,307 --> 00:34:56,442
Just get my space and then I
can talk to you about that.

264
00:34:57,791 --> 00:34:59,619
I'm sorry, what did you say?

265
00:34:59,662 --> 00:35:02,230
What's headstand called in Sanskrit?

266
00:35:02,274 --> 00:35:03,449
Why?

267
00:35:03,492 --> 00:35:04,580
Cause I want to know if you come to yoga

268
00:35:04,624 --> 00:35:06,301
to pick up girls or to practice yoga.

269
00:35:06,321 --> 00:35:09,759
Well, yoga means union with God, right?

270
00:35:09,803 --> 00:35:11,785
I don't think there's any
greater closeness between man

271
00:35:11,805 --> 00:35:14,179
and his creator than the love
between a man and a woman.

272
00:35:14,199 --> 00:35:16,462
So I come to yoga to practice yoga,

273
00:35:16,505 --> 00:35:18,812
whether I meet a woman or not.

274
00:35:18,855 --> 00:35:20,118
Gotcha.

275
00:35:20,161 --> 00:35:24,122
And Sirsasana is my favorite position.

276
00:35:24,165 --> 00:35:25,297
You?

277
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:27,279
I hate it, I don't
like being upside down.

278
00:35:27,299 --> 00:35:28,474
Really?

279
00:35:28,517 --> 00:35:30,128
Well, that's funny.

280
00:35:30,171 --> 00:35:32,501
It's the place where I feel
like things make the most sense.

281
00:35:32,521 --> 00:35:34,697
Listen, just so my entire concentration

282
00:35:34,741 --> 00:35:35,983
isn't completely distracted every

283
00:35:36,003 --> 00:35:37,419
other breath throughout class,

284
00:35:37,439 --> 00:35:38,855
wondering whether you're
ever gonna go out with me,

285
00:35:38,875 --> 00:35:43,315
I'm just gonna ask, once again,
right before class starts.

286
00:35:45,752 --> 00:35:46,796
Is that a yes?

287
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:47,623
No.

288
00:35:47,667 --> 00:35:49,277
Come on, really?

289
00:35:49,321 --> 00:35:50,409
Maybe.

290
00:35:50,452 --> 00:35:54,195
What's the determining factor gonna be?

291
00:35:54,239 --> 00:35:56,154
How good your headstand is.

292
00:35:56,197 --> 00:35:57,397
Om.

293
00:36:07,774 --> 00:36:09,297
So, what's the verdict?

294
00:36:09,341 --> 00:36:10,864
A walk.

295
00:36:10,907 --> 00:36:12,237
Like a pre-date, determining walk,

296
00:36:12,257 --> 00:36:14,302
or a walk that's a date?

297
00:36:14,346 --> 00:36:16,870
A walk that's a walk.

298
00:36:20,047 --> 00:36:22,919
I like to know what things are.

299
00:36:22,963 --> 00:36:25,531
There's no such thing
as a date in France anyway.

300
00:36:25,574 --> 00:36:27,098
You know, we don't label things.

301
00:36:27,141 --> 00:36:30,318
We just spend time together
and see what happens.

302
00:36:30,362 --> 00:36:33,234
Man, that is such bullshit!

303
00:36:33,278 --> 00:36:35,260
You're a woman, so I don't
give a fuck where you're from.

304
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,566
That means you have
expectations and you have rules

305
00:36:37,586 --> 00:36:39,197
and you have an agenda, okay?

306
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:42,243
To say that you don't is a game
at best and a lie at worst.

307
00:36:42,287 --> 00:36:44,245
You're so American.

308
00:36:44,289 --> 00:36:45,203
Really?

309
00:36:45,246 --> 00:36:46,769
Okay, well, if American means

310
00:36:46,813 --> 00:36:48,360
straight forward and honest,
then sure, I'm American.

311
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:50,536
I know it's hard for you
Americans to understand,

312
00:36:50,556 --> 00:36:54,037
but sometimes you don't
get what you want, do you?

313
00:36:54,081 --> 00:36:55,281
Rarely.

314
00:36:56,388 --> 00:36:58,216
You rarely don't get what you want?

315
00:36:58,259 --> 00:36:59,459
Yeah.

316
00:37:00,566 --> 00:37:02,548
So even though you
usually get what you want,

317
00:37:02,568 --> 00:37:06,354
when you don't, you're able
to accept it with grace?

318
00:37:06,398 --> 00:37:08,095
Do you think?

319
00:37:08,138 --> 00:37:10,077
Well, you're not getting
a definition for the walk,

320
00:37:10,097 --> 00:37:13,231
and you seem to be doing pretty
well with the uncertainty.

321
00:37:13,274 --> 00:37:14,908
That's just because I'm
used to it with you now,

322
00:37:14,928 --> 00:37:18,366
so it's just become kind
of maddeningly lovely.

323
00:37:18,410 --> 00:37:21,413
Oh, the other time was when
I wouldn't confirm or deny

324
00:37:21,456 --> 00:37:24,720
if I would go out on a date
with you before yoga started?

325
00:37:24,764 --> 00:37:25,547
Exactly!

326
00:37:25,591 --> 00:37:26,287
You know me so well.

327
00:37:26,331 --> 00:37:27,941
All the mystery's gone.

328
00:37:27,984 --> 00:37:30,726
Thank God for that at least.

329
00:37:30,770 --> 00:37:33,076
So no private information?

330
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:34,295
No, sure, you can have
private information.

331
00:37:34,339 --> 00:37:37,951
Just not if it concerns
thinking I'm cool.

332
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:44,000
Or not, apparently, in your case.

333
00:37:44,044 --> 00:37:45,915
No, no, you're cool.

334
00:37:45,959 --> 00:37:47,308
Well, thank you.

335
00:37:47,352 --> 00:37:48,266
So are you.

336
00:37:48,309 --> 00:37:49,509
Thanks.

337
00:37:50,311 --> 00:37:51,684
So listen, can we upgrade this walk

338
00:37:51,704 --> 00:37:54,576
that's a walk to walk
that's a date now, please?

339
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:55,316
No.

340
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,665
Oh, come on, why not?

341
00:37:56,709 --> 00:37:59,277
Cause you're not that cool.

342
00:38:01,148 --> 00:38:04,630
Depending on the day, that would gut me.

343
00:38:04,673 --> 00:38:06,371
Oh, and on this day?

344
00:38:07,459 --> 00:38:08,659
Pinprick.

345
00:38:09,504 --> 00:38:10,418
'Cause, you know, I just came from yoga,

346
00:38:10,462 --> 00:38:13,291
so I'm free from all attachments.

347
00:38:13,334 --> 00:38:16,337
Well, good, I'll sleep easier knowing.

348
00:38:16,381 --> 00:38:18,470
So much so that I'm even willing

349
00:38:18,513 --> 00:38:20,365
to do your whole in
France, we don't date,

350
00:38:20,385 --> 00:38:23,126
we just hang out and
see what happens thing?

351
00:38:23,170 --> 00:38:24,780
What's you number?

352
00:38:26,478 --> 00:38:27,783
Oh, come on!

353
00:38:27,827 --> 00:38:28,610
Hey, come on.

354
00:38:28,654 --> 00:38:29,437
What's your number?

355
00:38:29,481 --> 00:38:30,681
Hey, hey!

356
00:38:32,527 --> 00:38:34,509
There's something I'm
gonna tell you one day

357
00:38:34,529 --> 00:38:36,792
that I thought when I first saw you.

358
00:38:36,836 --> 00:38:38,533
I don't think so.

359
00:38:39,491 --> 00:38:40,691
You'll see.

360
00:38:45,410 --> 00:38:46,846
I lied.

361
00:38:46,889 --> 00:38:50,806
It was always devastating,
always a crucifixion.

362
00:38:50,850 --> 00:38:52,460
What women will never understand

363
00:38:52,504 --> 00:38:55,550
is the weight of having
to be the constant pursuer

364
00:38:55,594 --> 00:38:57,594
and the pain of every
death when it's a no.

365
00:39:13,133 --> 00:39:16,484
You have one new message.

366
00:39:16,528 --> 00:39:18,051
Hey, Michael, It's Josh.

367
00:39:18,094 --> 00:39:19,400
Bad news, man.

368
00:39:19,444 --> 00:39:21,924
We got six more passes
on your new manuscript.

369
00:39:21,968 --> 00:39:23,253
Sorry to leave it on your machine,

370
00:39:23,273 --> 00:39:25,493
but I knew you'd want to know ASAP.

371
00:39:25,537 --> 00:39:27,408
We're still out to two last publishers.

372
00:39:27,452 --> 00:39:28,975
All we need is one.

373
00:40:10,495 --> 00:40:11,931
What do you want?

374
00:40:11,974 --> 00:40:14,455
Handjob, blowjob, sex?

375
00:40:14,499 --> 00:40:15,717
What's your name?

376
00:40:15,761 --> 00:40:17,415
Veronica.

377
00:40:17,458 --> 00:40:18,720
Hi Veronica.

378
00:40:18,764 --> 00:40:19,895
I'm Michael.

379
00:40:19,939 --> 00:40:22,115
Hello, Michael.

380
00:40:22,158 --> 00:40:23,812
So, what do you want?

381
00:40:24,683 --> 00:40:26,293
What do I want?

382
00:40:28,469 --> 00:40:30,602
How much for a handjob?

383
00:40:39,654 --> 00:40:40,854
300.

384
00:40:42,178 --> 00:40:44,093
Because I have a cool leather jacket,

385
00:40:44,137 --> 00:40:47,575
you're gonna charge me
300 bucks for a handjob?

386
00:40:47,619 --> 00:40:51,927
Actually, you have a button
missing, it was a discount.

387
00:41:00,501 --> 00:41:02,503
Hey, I was only kidding, come on.

388
00:41:02,547 --> 00:41:05,419
250, because of your cool sneakers!

389
00:41:32,925 --> 00:41:35,884
You can ask for mercy,

390
00:41:35,928 --> 00:41:38,539
and if I feel like giving
it, you may get some.

391
00:41:38,583 --> 00:41:40,367
But you need to trust that

392
00:41:40,410 --> 00:41:43,413
I know better than you what you need.

393
00:42:06,698 --> 00:42:07,898
Shit.

394
00:42:19,406 --> 00:42:20,233
Hello?

395
00:42:20,276 --> 00:42:21,190
Michael Shiver?

396
00:42:21,234 --> 00:42:22,452
Speaking.

397
00:42:22,496 --> 00:42:23,912
I'm Sherry Ann with Card Services.

398
00:42:23,932 --> 00:42:26,195
I'm calling about your
past-due account with us.

399
00:42:26,239 --> 00:42:27,588
How much do I owe you?

400
00:42:27,632 --> 00:42:29,024
Well, you have three accounts

401
00:42:29,068 --> 00:42:31,940
with us for a total
of $427,654.89.

402
00:42:35,248 --> 00:42:36,554
They all are 90 days late.

403
00:42:36,597 --> 00:42:37,772
Can you make a payment now?

404
00:42:37,816 --> 00:42:39,426
I'm sorry, I just really can't.

405
00:42:39,469 --> 00:42:42,472
I'm just in a, in a very bad
way financially right now.

406
00:42:42,516 --> 00:42:44,736
Oh, I understand.

407
00:42:44,779 --> 00:42:47,782
Well I could enroll you in
the payment-protection plan

408
00:42:47,826 --> 00:42:49,938
and then you wouldn't have to
pay anything for three months.

409
00:42:49,958 --> 00:42:50,872
Would that help?

410
00:42:50,916 --> 00:42:52,613
Yeah, that would be amazing.

411
00:42:52,657 --> 00:42:53,745
If you could do that.

412
00:42:53,788 --> 00:42:54,702
I'd really appreciate that.

413
00:42:54,746 --> 00:42:55,747
Let me just see.

414
00:42:55,790 --> 00:42:57,879
Let me do that for you right now.

415
00:42:57,923 --> 00:42:59,881
Okay, thank you.

416
00:42:59,925 --> 00:43:01,709
Thank you for your kindness.

417
00:43:01,753 --> 00:43:04,886
No, it is my pleasure,
all right, you're all set.

418
00:43:04,930 --> 00:43:05,800
You take care, now.

419
00:43:05,844 --> 00:43:07,715
Thank you, have a nice night.

420
00:43:07,759 --> 00:43:08,716
Bye.

421
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:09,960
Bye.

422
00:43:36,526 --> 00:43:37,789
You still say you

423
00:43:37,832 --> 00:43:40,313
don't come to yoga to pick up girls?

424
00:43:40,356 --> 00:43:41,836
Crying now, even?

425
00:43:43,316 --> 00:43:44,645
The voice of Satan is unmistakable,

426
00:43:44,665 --> 00:43:46,841
even with a french accent.

427
00:43:47,799 --> 00:43:49,844
It's so weird to see a guy cry in public.

428
00:43:49,888 --> 00:43:53,631
You know, with woman, it's
familiar, almost expected.

429
00:43:53,674 --> 00:43:54,849
You see a woman cry in yoga,

430
00:43:54,893 --> 00:43:56,526
you want to give her a handkerchief.

431
00:43:56,546 --> 00:43:59,767
You see a guy cry in yoga,
you want to call the police.

432
00:43:59,811 --> 00:44:01,967
I'm crying on the floor
of a foreign country,

433
00:44:01,987 --> 00:44:03,577
and you're saying it's
an act to pick up chicks?

434
00:44:03,597 --> 00:44:05,512
Does your evil know no bounds?

435
00:44:05,555 --> 00:44:07,079
I'm sorry.

436
00:44:07,122 --> 00:44:10,560
I was just trying to lighten
up whatever was making you sad.

437
00:44:10,604 --> 00:44:12,780
I guess it wasn't the
right angle to take.

438
00:44:12,824 --> 00:44:14,024
I apologize.

439
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:15,696
Okay.

440
00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:16,940
Om.

441
00:44:26,228 --> 00:44:29,057
You still have two hours to
ask me out on a date again.

442
00:44:29,101 --> 00:44:30,798
No, I'm done with all that.

443
00:44:30,842 --> 00:44:32,147
Why?

444
00:44:32,191 --> 00:44:34,062
Cause I'm decrepit and my life's over.

445
00:44:34,106 --> 00:44:35,716
Come on, just one more try.

446
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:38,003
No, if we're going out,
you're doing the asking.

447
00:44:38,023 --> 00:44:39,241
Fuck you.

448
00:44:39,285 --> 00:44:40,485
Yes.

449
00:44:42,070 --> 00:44:43,270
Om.

450
00:44:52,864 --> 00:44:54,822
So, what were you crying about?

451
00:44:54,866 --> 00:44:56,998
Oh, God, dear sweet Jesus.

452
00:44:57,042 --> 00:44:59,261
Why was I crying in yoga?

453
00:44:59,305 --> 00:45:00,045
Merci.

454
00:45:00,088 --> 00:45:01,288
Merci.

455
00:45:02,874 --> 00:45:04,832
You know when you're feeling

456
00:45:04,876 --> 00:45:08,749
really, really down and just
some random person from,

457
00:45:08,793 --> 00:45:11,186
like, the oddest place is kind to you,

458
00:45:11,230 --> 00:45:12,927
and you just lose it?

459
00:45:15,234 --> 00:45:16,539
That's what happened.

460
00:45:16,583 --> 00:45:18,130
This, this, uh like bill-collector lady

461
00:45:18,150 --> 00:45:20,718
from the Midwest was kind to me.

462
00:45:23,895 --> 00:45:27,202
I'm sorry, was that too, uh,
touchy-feely or something?

463
00:45:27,246 --> 00:45:28,726
No, no, no.

464
00:45:28,769 --> 00:45:29,857
You asked.

465
00:45:29,901 --> 00:45:31,772
No, I'm glad you told me.

466
00:45:31,816 --> 00:45:32,860
No, no.

467
00:45:32,904 --> 00:45:33,774
It's, it's good for me to practice

468
00:45:33,818 --> 00:45:36,037
being a girl sometimes you know,

469
00:45:36,081 --> 00:45:37,952
like sharing emotional things

470
00:45:37,996 --> 00:45:41,739
and listening, being
sympathetic, you know?

471
00:45:43,436 --> 00:45:45,264
Is that hard for you?

472
00:45:46,700 --> 00:45:48,421
That was enough practicing for one night.

473
00:45:48,441 --> 00:45:50,443
Oh, come on, man up.

474
00:45:50,486 --> 00:45:53,794
Just one more question and that's it.

475
00:45:56,841 --> 00:46:00,453
Okay, what are the top five deal breakers

476
00:46:00,496 --> 00:46:04,370
for the guys that you,
you know, non-date date?

477
00:46:05,806 --> 00:46:08,069
You need to be funny.

478
00:46:08,113 --> 00:46:08,896
Okay.

479
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:09,941
Smart.

480
00:46:09,984 --> 00:46:11,184
Yeah.

481
00:46:12,117 --> 00:46:14,772
Not a drug addict or alcoholic or.

482
00:46:14,815 --> 00:46:16,015
Yeah.

483
00:46:18,863 --> 00:46:21,866
A big heart, and not judgmental.

484
00:46:23,563 --> 00:46:25,913
Like republican judgmental?

485
00:46:25,957 --> 00:46:29,917
No, like doesn't even judge
republicans not judgmental.

486
00:46:29,961 --> 00:46:31,161
Okay, Buddha.

487
00:46:34,356 --> 00:46:37,490
But I don't, I don't
go out with too many men.

488
00:46:37,533 --> 00:46:38,621
Really?

489
00:46:38,665 --> 00:46:39,927
Why not?

490
00:46:39,971 --> 00:46:40,928
I don't know.

491
00:46:40,972 --> 00:46:42,974
I guess I'm, I'm more like a guy.

492
00:46:43,017 --> 00:46:44,714
You know, I want sex, I have it.

493
00:46:44,758 --> 00:46:47,761
And I need a friend, it's different.

494
00:46:48,980 --> 00:46:51,547
Do you not want love in your life?

495
00:46:51,591 --> 00:46:53,723
Okay, that was enough questions for me.

496
00:46:53,767 --> 00:46:54,637
Come on.

497
00:46:54,681 --> 00:46:56,683
No, no, you, your girl.

498
00:46:57,858 --> 00:46:59,947
I'm a little afraid to ask but, you know.

499
00:46:59,991 --> 00:47:01,191
Why?

500
00:47:01,862 --> 00:47:03,342
She needs to be funny.

501
00:47:03,385 --> 00:47:04,822
Yeah, absolutely.

502
00:47:06,998 --> 00:47:09,870
Smart, witty, like from New York.

503
00:47:11,872 --> 00:47:14,005
She needs to not be a prude.

504
00:47:14,048 --> 00:47:15,658
Really?

505
00:47:15,702 --> 00:47:18,357
I mean, I don't think
you're a freak or anything,

506
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:21,969
but certainly not missionary
with the lights off.

507
00:47:22,013 --> 00:47:22,970
Not only does it have to be missionary

508
00:47:23,014 --> 00:47:24,667
with the lights off,

509
00:47:24,711 --> 00:47:27,496
but I like to have pretty much
no human contact whatsoever.

510
00:47:27,540 --> 00:47:30,151
So I find if you cut
a hole in the sheets,

511
00:47:30,195 --> 00:47:32,850
like the Quakers do or
whatever, you can almost

512
00:47:32,893 --> 00:47:36,027
do it without any feeling
of touching at all.

513
00:47:36,070 --> 00:47:36,984
Great.

514
00:47:37,028 --> 00:47:37,724
Yeah, it's really good.

515
00:47:37,767 --> 00:47:38,967
Perfect.

516
00:47:41,902 --> 00:47:43,102
And?

517
00:47:44,035 --> 00:47:44,862
No cats.

518
00:47:44,905 --> 00:47:46,428
Okay.

519
00:47:46,472 --> 00:47:48,280
No looking at me and smiling
lovingly while I'm eating.

520
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:49,562
What?

521
00:47:49,605 --> 00:47:50,780
You can't look at me and smile lovingly

522
00:47:50,824 --> 00:47:52,565
at me when I'm eating.

523
00:47:52,608 --> 00:47:56,003
And no touching my leg with your foot

524
00:47:56,047 --> 00:47:57,875
or anything while I'm eating.

525
00:47:57,918 --> 00:48:01,356
Can I, can I look at
you and smile lovingly

526
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:03,184
when you're not eating?

527
00:48:03,228 --> 00:48:04,707
Yeah.

528
00:48:04,751 --> 00:48:08,015
And touch your leg with my feet?

529
00:48:08,059 --> 00:48:10,278
Yeah, I would like that.

530
00:48:13,978 --> 00:48:17,068
You're kind of nuts, aren't you?

531
00:48:18,460 --> 00:48:19,660
Okay.

532
00:48:22,290 --> 00:48:24,945
I'm gone say this one time
and one time only, okay,

533
00:48:24,989 --> 00:48:29,428
so you need to listen
really, really carefully.

534
00:48:29,471 --> 00:48:30,671
Okay, okay.

535
00:48:33,780 --> 00:48:36,957
I am the most sane man that you know now

536
00:48:37,001 --> 00:48:40,308
or will ever meet in your entire life.

537
00:48:40,352 --> 00:48:41,570
Okay.

538
00:48:41,614 --> 00:48:43,117
Now, I realize that the simple fact

539
00:48:43,137 --> 00:48:45,444
that I would even say
something like that to you

540
00:48:45,487 --> 00:48:48,490
in your mind not only doesn't quash,

541
00:48:50,318 --> 00:48:53,582
but, in fact, amplifies your hypothesis

542
00:48:53,626 --> 00:48:57,021
that I am indeed crazy, but it does not.

543
00:48:59,197 --> 00:49:02,069
Okay, because underneath all of the

544
00:49:02,113 --> 00:49:04,008
can't look at me and smile
lovingly while I eat,

545
00:49:04,028 --> 00:49:06,987
blah, blah, blah, is the most honest,

546
00:49:08,293 --> 00:49:11,296
grounded person that you will ever know.

547
00:49:30,750 --> 00:49:32,099
You did not just do that.

548
00:49:32,143 --> 00:49:33,448
I thought so.

549
00:49:48,246 --> 00:49:50,291
I love the cold, do you love the cold?

550
00:49:50,335 --> 00:49:51,535
Yeah.

551
00:49:52,685 --> 00:49:55,862
And that thing, that's my
favorite thing in the world.

552
00:49:55,905 --> 00:49:56,863
Have you ever been up it?

553
00:49:56,906 --> 00:49:58,125
No.

554
00:49:58,169 --> 00:49:59,126
Shall we go up it now?

555
00:49:59,170 --> 00:50:00,040
No.

556
00:50:00,084 --> 00:50:02,564
I'm, I'm gonna go home now.

557
00:50:02,608 --> 00:50:03,913
Come on, Really?

558
00:50:03,957 --> 00:50:05,157
No, it's late.

559
00:50:07,178 --> 00:50:08,657
Get farther away.

560
00:50:08,701 --> 00:50:10,050
What are you afraid of?

561
00:50:10,094 --> 00:50:12,139
I'm not afraid of anything, I can't see.

562
00:50:12,183 --> 00:50:13,555
Why don't you wear your glasses?

563
00:50:13,575 --> 00:50:16,926
I don't need glasses, back up a step.

564
00:50:20,713 --> 00:50:22,584
Can you see me now?

565
00:50:22,628 --> 00:50:23,828
Perfectly.

566
00:50:26,893 --> 00:50:28,093
Now?

567
00:50:30,418 --> 00:50:32,072
You have really pretty eyes.

568
00:50:32,116 --> 00:50:33,316
Thanks.

569
00:50:38,122 --> 00:50:39,322
How about now?

570
00:50:41,125 --> 00:50:45,172
I have absolutely no idea who you are.

571
00:50:45,216 --> 00:50:50,221
But in the dictionary under
smitten should be how you smell.

572
00:50:54,747 --> 00:50:56,120
You must really like me if you're

573
00:50:56,140 --> 00:50:58,533
not gonna kiss me on the first date.

574
00:50:58,577 --> 00:50:59,777
Correct.

575
00:51:01,101 --> 00:51:02,537
Shucks.

576
00:51:02,581 --> 00:51:04,191
If we'd hated each other,

577
00:51:04,235 --> 00:51:06,608
we could have fucked in the
bathroom of the restaurant.

578
00:51:06,628 --> 00:51:07,957
You really are like a boy.

579
00:51:07,977 --> 00:51:09,588
Told you.

580
00:51:09,631 --> 00:51:11,198
Want to go out tomorrow night?

581
00:51:11,242 --> 00:51:12,373
Yeah.

582
00:51:12,417 --> 00:51:13,617
Good.

583
00:51:16,116 --> 00:51:19,250
If you don't suddenly become not you,

584
00:51:19,293 --> 00:51:21,275
I'm gonna be in love
with you by Christmas.

585
00:51:21,295 --> 00:51:24,124
You know, just for a time line.

586
00:51:24,168 --> 00:51:26,735
You better go now, or I'm gonna

587
00:51:26,779 --> 00:51:29,216
have a hard time remaining a gentlemen.

588
00:51:29,260 --> 00:51:31,218
I'm sorry, I can't understand you.

589
00:51:31,262 --> 00:51:33,244
You know, my English
words are not that good.

590
00:51:33,264 --> 00:51:35,440
Anyone who knows the word shucks

591
00:51:35,483 --> 00:51:36,812
has good enough English words

592
00:51:36,832 --> 00:51:39,618
to understand what I'm talking about.

593
00:51:42,969 --> 00:51:44,169
Scram.

594
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:47,713
Scram, now, that's a word I like.

595
00:54:39,624 --> 00:54:41,495
You're in Paris now.

596
00:54:41,539 --> 00:54:43,149
Everything is fashion.

597
00:54:43,192 --> 00:54:44,542
Yeah, you think?

598
00:54:44,585 --> 00:54:47,849
Even the hookers shame
you for your outfit here.

599
00:54:47,893 --> 00:54:49,677
And the final touch.

600
00:54:54,378 --> 00:54:55,578
Beautiful.

601
00:54:57,468 --> 00:54:58,668
Gorgeous.

602
00:54:59,687 --> 00:55:02,516
Well, you will woo her for sure.

603
00:55:03,735 --> 00:55:05,456
You're coming over for Christmas, yes?

604
00:55:05,476 --> 00:55:06,433
Yeah.

605
00:55:06,477 --> 00:55:07,216
And bring the girl.

606
00:55:07,260 --> 00:55:08,783
We're dying to meet her.

607
00:55:08,827 --> 00:55:12,047
Let's, let's see what happens, okay?

608
00:55:23,842 --> 00:55:25,060
No, no, no.

609
00:55:25,104 --> 00:55:27,846
No, no, give that back,
give that money back!

610
00:55:27,889 --> 00:55:30,327
No, take this, take this back.

611
00:55:30,370 --> 00:55:31,458
Don't do this to people.

612
00:55:31,502 --> 00:55:33,373
No, she does this all the time.

613
00:55:33,417 --> 00:55:34,331
Thank you, thank you.

614
00:55:34,374 --> 00:55:35,810
It's a con, don't worry.

615
00:55:35,854 --> 00:55:37,054
Don't do that to people!

616
00:55:48,388 --> 00:55:49,824
Bonjour, bonjour.

617
00:55:49,868 --> 00:55:51,826
I'm so sorry I'm late.

618
00:55:51,870 --> 00:55:53,001
I was saving these old people

619
00:55:53,045 --> 00:55:54,418
from getting swindled by gypsies.

620
00:55:54,438 --> 00:55:55,352
Palm reading?

621
00:55:55,395 --> 00:55:56,570
No, no.

622
00:55:56,614 --> 00:55:57,354
She pretends to find
this ring at your feet.

623
00:55:57,397 --> 00:55:58,572
Oh, the lost ring.

624
00:55:58,616 --> 00:56:00,487
What you know about that?

625
00:56:00,531 --> 00:56:02,600
She did the exact same thing
to me three nights ago.

626
00:56:02,620 --> 00:56:05,013
You didn't give her money?

627
00:56:05,057 --> 00:56:06,232
What?

628
00:56:06,275 --> 00:56:07,735
It was my first night in Paris, okay?

629
00:56:07,755 --> 00:56:08,997
My street skills were a
little jet-lagged or whatever.

630
00:56:09,017 --> 00:56:11,542
I'm in romantic Paris
on this magical bridge,

631
00:56:11,585 --> 00:56:13,437
and this sweet, little
lady gives me this, like,

632
00:56:13,457 --> 00:56:15,372
graced ring that God laid at my feet

633
00:56:15,415 --> 00:56:16,677
for my bride-to-be, okay?

634
00:56:16,721 --> 00:56:18,244
I fucking gave her some money.

635
00:56:18,287 --> 00:56:19,419
Listen, it's not funny.

636
00:56:19,463 --> 00:56:20,594
So, after I saved the people,

637
00:56:20,638 --> 00:56:22,248
then told the lady to fuck off

638
00:56:22,291 --> 00:56:24,230
and never do that anymore,
she started screaming at me

639
00:56:24,250 --> 00:56:26,383
and doing this weird like,

640
00:56:27,427 --> 00:56:31,083
at me and then she told
me she was watching me.

641
00:56:31,126 --> 00:56:32,978
So you don't think, like,
that she's gonna get,

642
00:56:32,998 --> 00:56:34,719
like, the gypsy men to
come stab me in the ass

643
00:56:34,739 --> 00:56:36,416
or something, like when I'm
walking down the street?

644
00:56:36,436 --> 00:56:37,481
No.

645
00:56:37,524 --> 00:56:38,699
But she said she was watching me,

646
00:56:38,743 --> 00:56:39,744
like she knows where I live.

647
00:56:39,787 --> 00:56:41,093
She spoke English?

648
00:56:41,136 --> 00:56:41,876
No.

649
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:43,530
Then how?

650
00:56:43,574 --> 00:56:44,903
She did this thing with,
with her thing, like this.

651
00:56:44,923 --> 00:56:46,295
She went like, I'm watching you.

652
00:56:46,315 --> 00:56:47,578
I know where you live.

653
00:56:47,621 --> 00:56:48,622
That doesn't mean she's watching you.

654
00:56:48,666 --> 00:56:51,277
That means she puts a curse on you.

655
00:56:54,106 --> 00:56:54,976
Are you sure?

656
00:56:55,020 --> 00:56:57,588
Yeah, they're harmless!

657
00:56:57,631 --> 00:56:58,763
That's a curse?

658
00:56:58,806 --> 00:56:59,894
That doesn't mean that some gypsy clan's

659
00:56:59,938 --> 00:57:01,746
gonna come get me when I'm not watching?

660
00:57:01,766 --> 00:57:03,463
Just a curse.

661
00:57:03,507 --> 00:57:04,508
Oh well, fine.

662
00:57:04,551 --> 00:57:05,465
I could give a shit about a curse.

663
00:57:05,509 --> 00:57:06,423
Curse, schmurse.

664
00:57:06,466 --> 00:57:07,598
I eat curses for breakfast.

665
00:57:07,641 --> 00:57:08,686
Just as long as she's not gonna come

666
00:57:08,729 --> 00:57:10,276
cut my throat in the night, I can.

667
00:57:10,296 --> 00:57:12,104
But you need to stop
pantomiming at French women.

668
00:57:12,124 --> 00:57:13,671
You see, you keep getting in trouble.

669
00:57:13,691 --> 00:57:14,474
What are you talking about?

670
00:57:14,518 --> 00:57:15,475
She pantomimed me.

671
00:57:15,519 --> 00:57:16,719
Yeah, sure.

672
00:57:17,521 --> 00:57:19,131
What?

673
00:57:19,174 --> 00:57:21,374
What, what French women am
I have I been pantomiming?

674
00:57:21,394 --> 00:57:24,179
Me, the first time we
met at the orange store.

675
00:57:24,223 --> 00:57:25,509
What did I pantomime you?

676
00:57:25,529 --> 00:57:27,336
You asked if I was
strict with my boyfriends

677
00:57:27,356 --> 00:57:28,990
like I am with my dog, and you went,

678
00:57:29,010 --> 00:57:30,601
you thought I didn't
understand, so you went,

679
00:57:30,621 --> 00:57:33,972
you went like this, as if that's

680
00:57:34,015 --> 00:57:36,583
the universal signs for being
strict with one's lover.

681
00:57:36,627 --> 00:57:38,522
Okay, well, if you hadn't of, you know,

682
00:57:38,542 --> 00:57:40,611
pretended not to speak
English and just went out

683
00:57:40,631 --> 00:57:42,613
to mock and ridicule
innocent gentleman suitors...

684
00:57:42,633 --> 00:57:44,112
Innocent?

685
00:57:44,156 --> 00:57:47,028
Yeah, I was an innocent gentleman suitor.

686
00:57:47,072 --> 00:57:49,466
You do look like a gentleman today.

687
00:57:49,509 --> 00:57:50,945
Do you have a hot date?

688
00:57:50,989 --> 00:57:51,859
I did have one, and then I canceled

689
00:57:51,903 --> 00:57:54,471
about fucking 10 seconds ago.

690
00:57:55,559 --> 00:57:56,821
No, you look nice.

691
00:57:56,864 --> 00:57:57,952
Thank you.

692
00:57:57,996 --> 00:57:59,301
The suit suits you.

693
00:57:59,345 --> 00:58:00,520
Thank you.

694
00:58:00,564 --> 00:58:01,608
Can you say that?

695
00:58:01,652 --> 00:58:02,479
Yeah.

696
00:58:02,522 --> 00:58:03,349
The suit suits you?

697
00:58:03,392 --> 00:58:04,698
Yeah, the suit suits you.

698
00:58:04,742 --> 00:58:06,613
No, but what would you say?

699
00:58:06,657 --> 00:58:08,334
Well, normally, you
would say something like,

700
00:58:08,354 --> 00:58:09,640
you know, you look good in a suit,

701
00:58:09,660 --> 00:58:11,488
or, you wear that suit well.

702
00:58:11,531 --> 00:58:12,532
But not the suit suits you?

703
00:58:12,576 --> 00:58:13,861
No, I, I like the suit suits you.

704
00:58:13,881 --> 00:58:15,167
I think you should stick with that.

705
00:58:15,187 --> 00:58:16,667
No, I don't want to say it.

706
00:58:16,710 --> 00:58:17,711
Don't make me stupid.

707
00:58:17,755 --> 00:58:18,538
What?

708
00:58:18,582 --> 00:58:19,539
Sophie!

709
00:58:19,583 --> 00:58:20,366
What, come on.

710
00:58:20,409 --> 00:58:21,149
You're not really mad.

711
00:58:21,193 --> 00:58:21,976
Yes, I'm mad!

712
00:58:22,020 --> 00:58:23,238
I don't like that!

713
00:58:23,282 --> 00:58:24,655
Don't play games with me like that!

714
00:58:24,675 --> 00:58:26,570
I'm, I'm not some French
doll for you to play with!

715
00:58:26,590 --> 00:58:28,006
It's not correct to say it this way,

716
00:58:28,026 --> 00:58:29,660
and I don't want to sound like an idiot!

717
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:32,421
I'm, I'm sorry, Sophie, I'm sorry.

718
00:58:32,465 --> 00:58:33,751
It was sweet how you said it.

719
00:58:33,771 --> 00:58:36,687
I'm sorry, it won't happen again.

720
00:58:40,212 --> 00:58:43,520
So I thought we, we could get a bunch

721
00:58:45,434 --> 00:58:49,526
of stuff from the market
and go to my place.

722
00:58:49,569 --> 00:58:51,310
That sounds perfect.

723
00:58:53,225 --> 00:58:56,576
Oh God, it's like closed,
except for the cheese.

724
00:58:56,620 --> 00:58:58,578
The cheese lady is still here.

725
00:58:58,622 --> 00:59:01,233
Thank, I love cheese.

726
00:59:01,276 --> 00:59:02,669
You like cheese?

727
00:59:02,713 --> 00:59:04,695
Let's just have a, we'll
just have a cheese dinner.

728
00:59:04,715 --> 00:59:06,087
Who gives a shit about all this other,

729
00:59:06,107 --> 00:59:10,068
we'll just have only cheese
and then we'll rate it.

730
00:59:11,722 --> 00:59:13,573
I'm really excited about
our cheese contest,

731
00:59:13,593 --> 00:59:14,681
I got to tell you.

732
00:59:14,725 --> 00:59:15,552
Are you excited about it?

733
00:59:15,595 --> 00:59:18,250
Yeah, I'm excited.

734
00:59:18,293 --> 00:59:20,600
So, what do you do for work?

735
00:59:20,644 --> 00:59:24,561
I take care of people who are dying.

736
00:59:25,649 --> 00:59:27,651
God, that's intense.

737
00:59:29,740 --> 00:59:31,263
Oh, man.

738
00:59:31,306 --> 00:59:34,135
You taking care of anyone now?

739
00:59:34,179 --> 00:59:36,050
A little girl.

740
00:59:36,094 --> 00:59:37,294
Really?

741
00:59:38,444 --> 00:59:39,860
Yeah, it's, it's the first
time it happens like that.

742
00:59:39,880 --> 00:59:44,232
Usually, it's, uh, old
people who have lived a nice,

743
00:59:44,276 --> 00:59:47,714
long life, you know, so somehow it's,

744
00:59:47,758 --> 00:59:50,587
it's a bit more manageable for me.

745
00:59:50,630 --> 00:59:51,892
How old is she?

746
00:59:51,936 --> 00:59:53,807
13, she has leukemia.

747
00:59:56,636 --> 00:59:58,899
Is there any chance she can get better?

748
00:59:58,943 --> 01:00:00,771
No, she'll die soon.

749
01:00:01,946 --> 01:00:04,426
How long does she have to live?

750
01:00:04,470 --> 01:00:06,080
It's hard to say.

751
01:00:06,124 --> 01:00:09,910
She might be waiting for
Christmas since she's a kid,

752
01:00:09,954 --> 01:00:13,479
or to say goodbye to her family, or both.

753
01:00:14,872 --> 01:00:16,656
God, that's so awful.

754
01:00:16,700 --> 01:00:17,900
Yeah.

755
01:00:18,702 --> 01:00:21,269
She reminds me of me when I was her age.

756
01:00:21,313 --> 01:00:22,793
Really, how so?

757
01:00:25,186 --> 01:00:27,798
I don't know, she just does.

758
01:00:30,670 --> 01:00:32,150
So, what do you do?

759
01:00:33,586 --> 01:00:35,370
Nothing nearly that important.

760
01:00:35,414 --> 01:00:37,764
Aw, come on, everything's important.

761
01:00:37,808 --> 01:00:41,638
Without a plumber, where
would we go to the bathroom?

762
01:00:41,681 --> 01:00:42,881
Good call.

763
01:00:43,727 --> 01:00:45,467
I write books.

764
01:00:45,511 --> 01:00:46,207
Really?

765
01:00:46,251 --> 01:00:46,991
Yeah.

766
01:00:47,034 --> 01:00:48,645
What books?

767
01:00:48,688 --> 01:00:50,714
Uh, the first one was
called The Blameless,

768
01:00:50,734 --> 01:00:52,649
which came out in 1986.

769
01:00:52,692 --> 01:00:54,651
Before you were born.

770
01:00:54,694 --> 01:00:57,697
I was born in 85, thank you.

771
01:01:00,874 --> 01:01:02,160
Is it weird at all for you to go out

772
01:01:02,180 --> 01:01:04,356
with somebody 15 years older than you?

773
01:01:04,399 --> 01:01:05,599
No.

774
01:01:06,706 --> 01:01:09,709
Because of, you're French?

775
01:01:09,753 --> 01:01:12,320
No, because father issues.

776
01:01:12,364 --> 01:01:15,149
Oh, so it's exactly like America.

777
01:01:15,193 --> 01:01:16,063
Perfect.

778
01:01:16,107 --> 01:01:18,849
Well, that's comforting knowing.

779
01:01:18,892 --> 01:01:22,156
Do you usually date women my age?

780
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:24,898
Uh, no, usually a little older.

781
01:01:26,770 --> 01:01:29,163
Then it's weird for you?

782
01:01:29,207 --> 01:01:30,730
No.

783
01:01:30,774 --> 01:01:32,930
No, as long as you can
name three Beatles albums,

784
01:01:32,950 --> 01:01:35,387
know what an album is,
and are a good kisser,

785
01:01:35,430 --> 01:01:37,108
then I think we have an excellent shot

786
01:01:37,128 --> 01:01:38,738
at happily ever after.

787
01:01:38,782 --> 01:01:42,437
And I still can't look at
you and smile and touch you,

788
01:01:42,481 --> 01:01:43,221
like, while you eat, blah, blah, blah?

789
01:01:43,264 --> 01:01:44,831
No, that's universal.

790
01:01:44,875 --> 01:01:45,745
You can never do that.

791
01:01:45,789 --> 01:01:46,989
Right.

792
01:01:49,880 --> 01:01:51,080
Okay, go.

793
01:01:54,275 --> 01:01:55,475
Come on.

794
01:01:57,888 --> 01:02:01,282
Abbey Road, Revolver
and the The White Album,

795
01:02:01,326 --> 01:02:03,787
which is a big, round, vinyl
thing which comes in a big,

796
01:02:03,807 --> 01:02:07,027
flat, square box with a
printed picture in it.

797
01:02:07,071 --> 01:02:08,899
Or it can just be white.

798
01:02:08,942 --> 01:02:10,639
Very good.

799
01:02:10,683 --> 01:02:11,858
And at this rate, the kissing

800
01:02:11,902 --> 01:02:13,622
you'll probably never find out about.

801
01:02:13,642 --> 01:02:14,842
Oh.

802
01:02:17,081 --> 01:02:18,778
Oh, you see that building?

803
01:02:18,822 --> 01:02:20,737
It used to be an old movie theater

804
01:02:20,780 --> 01:02:22,782
that only showed old American films.

805
01:02:22,826 --> 01:02:24,436
Really?

806
01:02:24,479 --> 01:02:27,569
You know, like the, the
Charlton Heston movies.

807
01:02:27,613 --> 01:02:28,788
Charlton Heston movies?

808
01:02:28,832 --> 01:02:31,922
Yeah, the, you know, Charlton Heston.

809
01:02:33,837 --> 01:02:35,403
Well, Charlton Heston was

810
01:02:35,447 --> 01:02:39,059
this extremely kind of though
macho, leading-man actor,

811
01:02:39,103 --> 01:02:40,911
he played Moses in The Ten Commandments.

812
01:02:40,931 --> 01:02:43,237
He like, parted the Red
Sea, I, I don't think he,

813
01:02:43,281 --> 01:02:44,958
he really danced like that in movies.

814
01:02:44,978 --> 01:02:47,067
I could be wrong, but you sure it was?

815
01:02:47,111 --> 01:02:50,767
Okay, so, oh, what were,
what was the dance in the 30s?

816
01:02:50,810 --> 01:02:54,814
You know, the, wasn't
it the Charlton Heston?

817
01:02:54,858 --> 01:02:57,774
Oh, oh, do, do you mean the Charleston?

818
01:02:57,817 --> 01:02:59,819
Yeah, right, The Charleston.

819
01:02:59,863 --> 01:03:02,019
Okay, so that's the movie
theater that shows movies

820
01:03:02,039 --> 01:03:06,957
where they dance the Charleston,
not Charlton Heston movies.

821
01:03:09,133 --> 01:03:10,656
What?

822
01:03:10,699 --> 01:03:11,831
I told you not to do that!

823
01:03:11,875 --> 01:03:12,963
Do what?

824
01:03:13,006 --> 01:03:13,833
To make me look stupid!

825
01:03:13,877 --> 01:03:15,269
Oh, come on.

826
01:03:15,313 --> 01:03:16,947
You made a joke about the
Charlton Heston Charleston.

827
01:03:16,967 --> 01:03:17,924
You, you can't get mad at me for that.

828
01:03:17,968 --> 01:03:18,795
I didn't make a joke!

829
01:03:18,838 --> 01:03:19,796
I make a mistake.

830
01:03:19,839 --> 01:03:20,927
You laugh once, you don't have

831
01:03:20,971 --> 01:03:22,799
to keep talking about it all the time!

832
01:03:22,842 --> 01:03:23,974
Okay, I'm sorry.

833
01:03:24,017 --> 01:03:25,453
I want you to go now!

834
01:03:25,497 --> 01:03:26,628
Come on.

835
01:03:26,672 --> 01:03:29,240
Don't ever touch me like that.

836
01:04:22,902 --> 01:04:23,860
Oh, God!

837
01:04:23,903 --> 01:04:25,103
Fuck me, fuck me.

838
01:04:34,261 --> 01:04:36,002
Where is the cheese?

839
01:04:44,619 --> 01:04:46,752
It's time to rate them, you go first.

840
01:04:46,795 --> 01:04:49,189
Okay, so, how do you want to do this?

841
01:04:49,233 --> 01:04:50,712
What do you mean?

842
01:04:50,756 --> 01:04:54,194
Well, are we gonna rate
these cheeses against all food?

843
01:04:54,238 --> 01:04:56,394
I mean, all cheese is better
than Brussels sprouts.

844
01:04:56,414 --> 01:04:59,243
So do we need a different scale or?

845
01:04:59,286 --> 01:05:00,766
No, no.

846
01:05:00,809 --> 01:05:03,638
We'll rate them against all foods,

847
01:05:03,682 --> 01:05:05,945
and, and we'll go like this.

848
01:05:05,989 --> 01:05:08,905
Like, okay, so, if dog shit was one

849
01:05:08,948 --> 01:05:12,734
and chocolate cake was
10, rate these cheeses.

850
01:05:12,778 --> 01:05:15,476
What's worse than dog shit?

851
01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:17,676
Nothing, that's why
it's one, it's the lowest.

852
01:05:17,696 --> 01:05:19,263
Zero is the lowest.

853
01:05:19,306 --> 01:05:20,829
That's right, in France,

854
01:05:20,873 --> 01:05:22,962
the ground floor is zero, it's not one.

855
01:05:23,006 --> 01:05:24,422
Cause what, in the States, it's?

856
01:05:24,442 --> 01:05:26,574
It's one, the ground floor is one.

857
01:05:26,618 --> 01:05:28,750
Everything has to be more in the States.

858
01:05:28,794 --> 01:05:29,994
Oh, please.

859
01:05:31,362 --> 01:05:32,276
- Okay.
- Okay.

860
01:05:32,319 --> 01:05:33,581
So, dog shit is zero.

861
01:05:33,625 --> 01:05:36,976
Chocolate cake is 10, rate these cheeses.

862
01:05:37,020 --> 01:05:37,934
No, that won't work.

863
01:05:37,977 --> 01:05:39,109
Why won't that work?

864
01:05:39,152 --> 01:05:41,111
Because if we're gonna include all food,

865
01:05:41,154 --> 01:05:45,506
we're gonna need more
numbers, like up to 100.

866
01:05:45,550 --> 01:05:47,247
Okay, great.

867
01:05:47,291 --> 01:05:48,596
Dog shit is zero.

868
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:50,076
Chocolate cake is 100.

869
01:05:50,120 --> 01:05:51,817
Rate these cheeses.

870
01:05:51,860 --> 01:05:53,146
No, that's still too confusing.

871
01:05:53,166 --> 01:05:53,950
Why?

872
01:05:53,993 --> 01:05:55,081
It is.

873
01:05:55,125 --> 01:05:56,604
What is confusing about it?

874
01:05:56,648 --> 01:05:57,848
Oh, my God!

875
01:05:58,998 --> 01:06:02,784
Let's just say that cheese
in general is like 90.

876
01:06:02,828 --> 01:06:05,874
Okay, I would say, yeah,
like 92, but whatever.

877
01:06:05,918 --> 01:06:07,267
Okay.

878
01:06:07,311 --> 01:06:09,119
And now let's rate these
cheeses from zero to 10,

879
01:06:09,139 --> 01:06:12,446
10 being our favorite and
zero our least favorite.

880
01:06:12,490 --> 01:06:13,970
Perfect.

881
01:06:14,013 --> 01:06:16,320
First, I just need to
fuck you again real quick,

882
01:06:16,363 --> 01:06:17,649
and then we can do that, okay?

883
01:06:17,669 --> 01:06:19,172
'Cause you look really pretty right now.

884
01:06:19,192 --> 01:06:20,106
No, not now, not now.

885
01:06:20,150 --> 01:06:21,107
Come on!

886
01:06:21,151 --> 01:06:22,282
Not now.

887
01:06:22,326 --> 01:06:23,196
It's all right, just give me a second.

888
01:06:23,240 --> 01:06:23,892
I'm not in the mood right now.

889
01:06:23,936 --> 01:06:25,136
Baby, come on.

890
01:06:26,373 --> 01:06:29,159
All right, all right, go ahead.

891
01:06:29,202 --> 01:06:30,682
Okay, rate them.

892
01:06:31,509 --> 01:06:33,511
Zero to 100, zero to 10.

893
01:06:33,554 --> 01:06:35,121
Oh, that's boring.

894
01:06:35,165 --> 01:06:36,731
Come on, come on!

895
01:06:36,775 --> 01:06:40,387
Okay, I have to go to work now anyway.

896
01:06:40,431 --> 01:06:42,737
You go to the hospital this late?

897
01:06:42,781 --> 01:06:44,415
Yeah, sometimes she can't sleep at night,

898
01:06:44,435 --> 01:06:46,176
so I, I sit with her.

899
01:06:47,177 --> 01:06:49,005
Come on, I'm late.

900
01:06:49,048 --> 01:06:50,248
Really.

901
01:06:51,181 --> 01:06:52,530
Does she ever have any,

902
01:06:52,573 --> 01:06:53,748
I mean, do you ever, like, bring

903
01:06:53,792 --> 01:06:56,055
anybody else to visit her besides you?

904
01:06:56,099 --> 01:06:58,188
No, it might upset her.

905
01:07:00,364 --> 01:07:02,844
You have to go now, I'm in a hurry.

906
01:07:02,888 --> 01:07:03,584
Okay.

907
01:07:03,628 --> 01:07:04,368
Come on!

908
01:07:04,411 --> 01:07:05,611
Okay.

909
01:07:11,418 --> 01:07:14,117
Well, I had a, an amazing time.

910
01:07:16,728 --> 01:07:17,928
Me too.

911
01:07:24,388 --> 01:07:27,173
Um, I guess I'll, I'll call you later.

912
01:07:27,217 --> 01:07:28,174
It's, it's not this door.

913
01:07:28,218 --> 01:07:29,436
It's this way.

914
01:07:33,092 --> 01:07:36,139
I hope, I hope work isn't too hard.

915
01:07:40,447 --> 01:07:41,753
Goodnight.

916
01:07:41,796 --> 01:07:42,996
Bye.

917
01:10:02,546 --> 01:10:07,028
Do you have a hard
time getting close to people?

918
01:10:07,072 --> 01:10:08,421
To people?

919
01:10:08,465 --> 01:10:13,209
I don't know, to boys
that you like who like you.

920
01:10:13,252 --> 01:10:15,123
Do you believe in heaven?

921
01:10:15,167 --> 01:10:16,777
Okay, end of the conversation.

922
01:10:16,821 --> 01:10:19,127
Oh, come on, it's boring.

923
01:10:21,173 --> 01:10:23,373
It's very sweet, and it
actually strangely makes sense,

924
01:10:23,393 --> 01:10:25,438
but, and you're very smart.

925
01:10:25,482 --> 01:10:27,115
You're not dumb, you're not an idiot.

926
01:10:27,135 --> 01:10:28,441
There's no one...

927
01:10:28,485 --> 01:10:30,380
Okay, okay, don't
worry, I won't freak out.

928
01:10:30,400 --> 01:10:31,575
What?

929
01:10:31,618 --> 01:10:33,403
Well, you use boring when you

930
01:10:33,446 --> 01:10:35,361
don't really mean to use that word.

931
01:10:35,405 --> 01:10:36,884
Really?

932
01:10:36,928 --> 01:10:38,431
Yeah, like when we were
gonna have the cheese contest,

933
01:10:38,451 --> 01:10:39,713
and you really wanted to,

934
01:10:39,757 --> 01:10:41,086
and then suddenly you didn't want to,

935
01:10:41,106 --> 01:10:42,890
you said it was boring.

936
01:10:42,934 --> 01:10:44,959
And then just now, when I
asked you a personal question...

937
01:10:44,979 --> 01:10:46,938
Okay, okay, so what should I say?

938
01:10:46,981 --> 01:10:48,418
What would you say?

939
01:10:48,461 --> 01:10:51,725
Well, hopefully, you would
just answer my question.

940
01:10:51,769 --> 01:10:54,075
But if you didn't want
to answer a question,

941
01:10:54,119 --> 01:10:59,124
you would say something like,
I don't want to talk about it.

942
01:10:59,951 --> 01:11:01,324
I don't want to talk about it.

943
01:11:01,344 --> 01:11:03,389
Do you believe in heaven?

944
01:11:03,433 --> 01:11:04,957
I don't want to talk about it.

945
01:11:04,999 --> 01:11:07,350
Oh, come on, don't be a baby!

946
01:11:20,014 --> 01:11:22,278
Living right there forever.

947
01:11:23,453 --> 01:11:27,283
We'd be ancient, like 120 years old,

948
01:11:27,326 --> 01:11:28,612
and I'd be sitting
under this willow tree,

949
01:11:28,632 --> 01:11:31,330
watching the tourist boats go by.

950
01:11:31,374 --> 01:11:35,291
And you would yell over,
honey, come home for lunch,

951
01:11:35,334 --> 01:11:36,814
I made Vichyssoise.

952
01:11:45,518 --> 01:11:48,434
That would be heaven to me.

953
01:11:48,478 --> 01:11:51,611
You know the soup, Vichyssoise?

954
01:11:51,655 --> 01:11:52,438
Of course.

955
01:11:52,482 --> 01:11:53,613
Say it again.

956
01:11:53,657 --> 01:11:55,354
Vichyssoise.

957
01:11:55,398 --> 01:11:57,617
Your French is getting very good.

958
01:11:57,661 --> 01:11:58,861
Merci.

959
01:11:59,663 --> 01:12:02,318
I make a very good Vichyssoise.

960
01:12:03,710 --> 01:12:06,322
You don't have to be so hot and cold.

961
01:12:06,365 --> 01:12:07,671
I won't hurt you.

962
01:12:09,673 --> 01:12:13,024
You don't have to be so impatient.

963
01:12:13,067 --> 01:12:15,983
You don't have to be so slow.

964
01:12:16,027 --> 01:12:19,204
You don't have to be so loud.

965
01:12:19,247 --> 01:12:22,250
You don't have to be so truculent.

966
01:12:23,426 --> 01:12:25,364
You don't have to
pretend to be so superior,

967
01:12:25,384 --> 01:12:28,126
using words you know I don't know.

968
01:12:31,216 --> 01:12:34,350
You look victorious, that concerns me.

969
01:12:34,393 --> 01:12:38,354
Will you shut up and kiss me already?

970
01:12:38,397 --> 01:12:40,051
Wait, French-kiss me.

971
01:12:44,621 --> 01:12:46,536
You're such an idiot.

972
01:12:58,896 --> 01:13:00,201
Doggy style?

973
01:13:00,245 --> 01:13:01,115
Hate.

974
01:13:01,159 --> 01:13:01,899
Really?

975
01:13:01,942 --> 01:13:03,204
Mmm.

976
01:13:03,248 --> 01:13:04,205
Most women love doggy style.

977
01:13:04,249 --> 01:13:05,381
You, doggy style?

978
01:13:05,424 --> 01:13:06,251
Hate.

979
01:13:06,294 --> 01:13:07,295
Really?

980
01:13:07,339 --> 01:13:08,384
Most men love doggy style.

981
01:13:08,427 --> 01:13:09,689
Yeah, no, no.

982
01:13:09,733 --> 01:13:10,908
I hate it, I want to be able to see...

983
01:13:10,951 --> 01:13:12,388
My breasts, yeah.

984
01:13:12,431 --> 01:13:14,259
No, your face.

985
01:13:14,302 --> 01:13:16,043
Well, and your breasts too.

986
01:13:16,087 --> 01:13:17,741
You know, everything.

987
01:13:20,483 --> 01:13:22,093
A man fucking you.

988
01:13:23,268 --> 01:13:25,531
A man fucking me?

989
01:13:25,575 --> 01:13:27,228
Okay, we're playing the game now.

990
01:13:30,449 --> 01:13:31,494
I've never done it.

991
01:13:31,537 --> 01:13:32,582
Have you ever thought about it?

992
01:13:32,625 --> 01:13:34,061
No.

993
01:13:34,105 --> 01:13:35,608
I mean, I've had
occasional, weird sex dreams

994
01:13:35,628 --> 01:13:38,631
about it, and, I've dabbled

995
01:13:38,675 --> 01:13:40,807
with girls pretending, but that's it.

996
01:13:40,851 --> 01:13:42,592
Pretending what?

997
01:13:42,635 --> 01:13:44,574
Pretending to be a man
fucking me, like, you know.

998
01:13:44,594 --> 01:13:45,725
Really?

999
01:13:45,769 --> 01:13:47,074
Yeah.

1000
01:13:47,118 --> 01:13:50,251
Long time ago with my,
with my last girlfriend.

1001
01:13:50,295 --> 01:13:52,602
So you're not into BDSM now?

1002
01:13:57,041 --> 01:13:59,478
No and I wasn't into it then.

1003
01:13:59,522 --> 01:14:04,352
It was just, you know,
occasional, normal playing around.

1004
01:14:04,396 --> 01:14:07,573
Oh, getting fucked with a strap-on

1005
01:14:07,617 --> 01:14:11,272
is occasional normal
playing around in America?

1006
01:14:11,316 --> 01:14:12,752
No, it's probably not normal

1007
01:14:12,796 --> 01:14:14,604
but it's more normal than is admitted.

1008
01:14:14,624 --> 01:14:16,016
I'll tell you that.

1009
01:14:16,060 --> 01:14:18,497
So, why haven't you tried it with a guy?

1010
01:14:18,541 --> 01:14:20,630
'Cause I'm not into men like that.

1011
01:14:20,673 --> 01:14:23,633
You know, I mean, everything
that I love about a woman

1012
01:14:23,676 --> 01:14:27,854
your hands, and feet and,
the softness of your skin,

1013
01:14:30,553 --> 01:14:33,643
kissing, that all disgusts me to men.

1014
01:14:36,210 --> 01:14:38,366
The men thing, it's more,
it was more psychological.

1015
01:14:38,386 --> 01:14:39,605
It's more the taboo.

1016
01:14:39,649 --> 01:14:42,695
It's being, you know,
dominated, punished.

1017
01:14:46,830 --> 01:14:48,353
I mean, having said that,

1018
01:14:48,396 --> 01:14:49,310
you know, at this point in my life, I,

1019
01:14:49,354 --> 01:14:50,640
I probably would have tried

1020
01:14:50,660 --> 01:14:52,531
it once if I weren't
terrified of H.I.V.

1021
01:14:52,575 --> 01:14:54,315
Well, you have safe sex.

1022
01:14:54,359 --> 01:14:55,882
No, forget about it.

1023
01:14:55,926 --> 01:14:57,342
I could wear three fucking rubbers.

1024
01:14:57,362 --> 01:14:58,058
Rubbers break.

1025
01:14:58,102 --> 01:14:59,495
It's way too risky.

1026
01:14:59,538 --> 01:15:02,062
It's just I would never,
I would never do it.

1027
01:15:02,106 --> 01:15:04,891
You don't think you're
using that as an excuse?

1028
01:15:04,935 --> 01:15:08,678
Because I'm afraid to admit that I'm gay?

1029
01:15:08,721 --> 01:15:09,983
Okay.

1030
01:15:10,027 --> 01:15:12,638
I would love to sky dive, but I'm

1031
01:15:12,682 --> 01:15:14,228
shit-scared to jump out of a plane

1032
01:15:14,248 --> 01:15:17,643
and heights, so I'll never do that.

1033
01:15:17,687 --> 01:15:20,646
That doesn't make me someone who's afraid

1034
01:15:20,690 --> 01:15:23,823
to admit that I'm a closet skydiver.

1035
01:15:23,867 --> 01:15:28,045
But you don't jerk off
thinking about skydiving.

1036
01:15:29,612 --> 01:15:31,202
I don't jerk off thinking
about fucking guys either.

1037
01:15:31,222 --> 01:15:32,682
So when your girlfriend
was fucking you in the ass,

1038
01:15:32,702 --> 01:15:34,747
you weren't turned on?

1039
01:15:36,706 --> 01:15:39,578
Okay, you're getting off-track.

1040
01:15:39,622 --> 01:15:41,580
In this game, you just ask questions

1041
01:15:41,624 --> 01:15:45,671
that can be answered
with hate, love, or like.

1042
01:15:45,715 --> 01:15:48,718
Well, I like this new game better.

1043
01:15:50,241 --> 01:15:51,459
Okay, good.

1044
01:15:51,503 --> 01:15:53,137
Well, you can play it
later after I leave.

1045
01:15:53,157 --> 01:15:56,160
So, how about any, um, BDSM for you?

1046
01:15:58,597 --> 01:15:59,797
Hate.

1047
01:16:00,468 --> 01:16:01,687
Really?

1048
01:16:01,731 --> 01:16:02,949
Yeah.

1049
01:16:02,993 --> 01:16:06,300
Maybe I'm traditional,
but I think it's weird.

1050
01:16:07,780 --> 01:16:11,392
So do you think I'm weird for
having experimented with it?

1051
01:16:11,436 --> 01:16:14,744
No, you've tried it in
your past, you said, and,

1052
01:16:14,787 --> 01:16:18,574
and now you're not interested
in it anymore, so that's fine.

1053
01:16:18,617 --> 01:16:19,749
Yeah, but do you think...

1054
01:16:19,792 --> 01:16:22,795
I just think that men should be real men.

1055
01:16:24,754 --> 01:16:25,954
Really?

1056
01:16:26,756 --> 01:16:29,759
So do real men only have vanilla sex?

1057
01:16:31,456 --> 01:16:32,656
No, no.

1058
01:16:33,676 --> 01:16:36,635
Can real men fantasize about

1059
01:16:36,679 --> 01:16:39,725
less-than-traditional sexual behaviors?

1060
01:16:39,769 --> 01:16:42,598
Yes, as long as they don't

1061
01:16:42,641 --> 01:16:45,165
fantasize about it all the time.

1062
01:16:46,950 --> 01:16:48,299
Okay, so how many times

1063
01:16:48,342 --> 01:16:51,128
can a man fantasize about non-traditional

1064
01:16:51,171 --> 01:16:54,610
sexual behaviors until
they're not a real man?

1065
01:16:54,653 --> 01:16:57,134
Like five times or 12 times or?

1066
01:16:58,396 --> 01:16:59,769
I can't trust a guy who fantasizes

1067
01:16:59,789 --> 01:17:01,529
about things I can't give him.

1068
01:17:01,573 --> 01:17:04,271
They're fantasizing about
women, okay, I get it.

1069
01:17:04,315 --> 01:17:06,926
But if a guy fantasizes about
having a dick in his ass,

1070
01:17:06,970 --> 01:17:09,363
fake or not, I'm gonna think

1071
01:17:10,669 --> 01:17:13,803
he's gonna want to do it, eventually.

1072
01:17:14,978 --> 01:17:18,808
You know, it, it feels
like he's lying to himself.

1073
01:17:20,157 --> 01:17:24,509
So it's fine for whoever,
not my boyfriend.

1074
01:17:24,552 --> 01:17:26,816
Look, I, I just, I just think

1075
01:17:29,557 --> 01:17:33,039
that mixing psychology
and sex is perverse.

1076
01:17:36,564 --> 01:17:40,351
You know, sort this thing
out with you shrink,

1077
01:17:41,439 --> 01:17:42,919
not in the bedroom.

1078
01:17:46,009 --> 01:17:47,663
Okay, listen.

1079
01:17:47,706 --> 01:17:50,666
I just wanted to ask you
something for real though.

1080
01:17:50,709 --> 01:17:51,710
All joking aside.

1081
01:17:51,754 --> 01:17:54,017
No, no more talking now.

1082
01:17:54,844 --> 01:17:56,086
No, come on, it's important.

1083
01:17:56,106 --> 01:17:58,674
It's important, just one last thing.

1084
01:18:00,023 --> 01:18:03,026
Do you not like going down on a man?

1085
01:18:05,593 --> 01:18:08,031
If I like the guy, sure I do.

1086
01:18:08,858 --> 01:18:10,686
Do you like me?

1087
01:18:10,729 --> 01:18:12,165
Yeah, I like you.

1088
01:18:12,209 --> 01:18:15,691
Because I, I feel like you're turned on

1089
01:18:15,734 --> 01:18:19,869
when we have sex, like you enjoy our sex.

1090
01:18:19,912 --> 01:18:21,174
Yeah, okay.

1091
01:18:21,218 --> 01:18:24,787
But you haven't even
touched my dick once.

1092
01:18:27,398 --> 01:18:28,921
Yes, I have.

1093
01:18:28,965 --> 01:18:30,836
No, you haven't.

1094
01:18:30,880 --> 01:18:32,122
I mean, forget going down on me.

1095
01:18:32,142 --> 01:18:35,362
You haven't even, you
haven't even touched it.

1096
01:18:35,406 --> 01:18:37,408
And so it just made me wonder, like,

1097
01:18:37,451 --> 01:18:39,715
do you not like doing that on any man,

1098
01:18:39,758 --> 01:18:43,762
or is it just specifically
me, or that you don't,

1099
01:18:45,808 --> 01:18:46,896
my body disgusts you?

1100
01:18:46,939 --> 01:18:48,225
It sort of makes me feel like,

1101
01:18:48,245 --> 01:18:51,727
I don't know, do you not like my body or?

1102
01:18:53,946 --> 01:18:56,601
Let me, let me put it his way.

1103
01:18:57,645 --> 01:18:59,865
If you were 10 pounds thinner,

1104
01:18:59,909 --> 01:19:02,302
I would have blown you by now.

1105
01:19:13,923 --> 01:19:15,123
Michael.

1106
01:19:17,013 --> 01:19:18,057
Michael.

1107
01:19:18,101 --> 01:19:19,301
Michael.

1108
01:19:26,109 --> 01:19:27,309
Micheal.

1109
01:19:45,128 --> 01:19:46,328
Michael.

1110
01:19:50,481 --> 01:19:52,788
I didn't mean it like that.

1111
01:20:10,022 --> 01:20:11,719
That was the meanest thing

1112
01:20:11,763 --> 01:20:14,635
that anyone has ever said to me.

1113
01:20:14,679 --> 01:20:15,879
I'm sorry.

1114
01:20:16,681 --> 01:20:18,814
It didn't come out right.

1115
01:20:20,990 --> 01:20:23,688
How is it supposed to come out?

1116
01:20:26,082 --> 01:20:27,823
I read your book.

1117
01:20:36,266 --> 01:20:38,877
I went and got it and read it.

1118
01:20:41,532 --> 01:20:42,838
It's beautiful.

1119
01:20:44,752 --> 01:20:47,233
You're so good at revealing yourself.

1120
01:20:47,277 --> 01:20:50,149
Most of us are not like that.

1121
01:20:50,193 --> 01:20:51,585
We have secrets.

1122
01:20:54,371 --> 01:20:56,373
Things we're ashamed of.

1123
01:20:59,028 --> 01:21:02,422
Scared to, scared to admit to ourselves,

1124
01:21:04,555 --> 01:21:06,252
let alone someone else.

1125
01:21:07,297 --> 01:21:08,864
You have no fear.

1126
01:21:10,561 --> 01:21:13,912
You accept who you are, and I don't know,

1127
01:21:13,956 --> 01:21:16,349
you even rejoice in it.

1128
01:21:16,393 --> 01:21:18,003
I have many flaws.

1129
01:21:18,047 --> 01:21:19,247
Let me finish.

1130
01:21:25,924 --> 01:21:28,579
That scares most people about you.

1131
01:21:28,622 --> 01:21:32,191
I told you that I will never hurt you.

1132
01:21:32,235 --> 01:21:35,107
You don't know that, you might.

1133
01:21:36,979 --> 01:21:41,026
But what I, what I loved
about your book is that,

1134
01:21:41,070 --> 01:21:43,202
even though she leaves
you in the end and,

1135
01:21:43,246 --> 01:21:46,249
and you're heartbroken, you're here.

1136
01:21:50,601 --> 01:21:53,082
And that's very brave.

1137
01:21:53,125 --> 01:21:55,258
And I want to be that brave.

1138
01:21:58,174 --> 01:22:01,655
I've never let myself love anyone before.

1139
01:22:04,180 --> 01:22:05,380
Never.

1140
01:22:07,139 --> 01:22:08,339
Never?

1141
01:22:09,272 --> 01:22:11,491
Never in your entire life?

1142
01:22:16,801 --> 01:22:19,630
But I, I, I want to try with you.

1143
01:22:35,994 --> 01:22:37,996
Can I ask you a question?

1144
01:22:40,825 --> 01:22:43,001
If I was to give you the best blowjob

1145
01:22:43,045 --> 01:22:47,005
you've ever had in you're
entire life right now,

1146
01:22:48,485 --> 01:22:49,988
would you think I was
doing it to make you

1147
01:22:50,008 --> 01:22:53,142
feel better or because I really want to?

1148
01:22:55,361 --> 01:22:58,060
And either way, would you care?

1149
01:23:04,196 --> 01:23:08,592
Honestly, at this point,
either way, I wouldn't care.

1150
01:23:17,035 --> 01:23:20,473
But just for the
record, I really want to.

1151
01:24:27,932 --> 01:24:29,716
Everything cool?

1152
01:24:29,760 --> 01:24:30,935
Yeah.

1153
01:24:30,978 --> 01:24:32,569
Is it still okay that I come in with you?

1154
01:24:32,589 --> 01:24:34,069
You have to come.

1155
01:24:34,112 --> 01:24:36,245
She requested an audience with you.

1156
01:24:36,288 --> 01:24:37,488
She did?

1157
01:24:38,116 --> 01:24:39,316
Come on.

1158
01:24:42,642 --> 01:24:43,842
Hello.

1159
01:24:44,775 --> 01:24:46,081
Anais, Michael.

1160
01:24:47,256 --> 01:24:48,213
'Bonjour.

1161
01:24:48,257 --> 01:24:49,127
I'm sorry.

1162
01:24:49,171 --> 01:24:50,824
That's the only French I know.

1163
01:24:50,868 --> 01:24:53,784
That's okay, I can speak English.

1164
01:24:55,307 --> 01:24:57,570
Anais, that's a, that's
a really pretty name.

1165
01:24:57,614 --> 01:24:59,485
Is it after Anais Nin?

1166
01:24:59,529 --> 01:25:01,226
She's my favorite writer.

1167
01:25:01,270 --> 01:25:02,009
Really?

1168
01:25:02,053 --> 01:25:03,315
Yeah.

1169
01:25:04,186 --> 01:25:06,231
Wow, that's cool top hat.

1170
01:25:06,275 --> 01:25:07,232
Where'd you get that?

1171
01:25:07,276 --> 01:25:08,973
She gave it to me.

1172
01:25:09,016 --> 01:25:10,148
She did?

1173
01:25:10,192 --> 01:25:11,323
And I'm waiting on a tuxedo to

1174
01:25:11,367 --> 01:25:13,760
go with it so I can have a proper dance.

1175
01:25:13,804 --> 01:25:15,110
Really?

1176
01:25:15,153 --> 01:25:18,287
Have you, uh, got in touch with Santa?

1177
01:25:18,330 --> 01:25:19,940
Cool!

1178
01:25:19,984 --> 01:25:21,270
Cause he's, like, making
some rounds tomorrow.

1179
01:25:21,290 --> 01:25:23,683
Maybe he could bring one by.

1180
01:25:25,294 --> 01:25:26,512
No!

1181
01:25:26,556 --> 01:25:28,320
You want to kill me
before I get my dance?

1182
01:25:28,340 --> 01:25:32,170
It's very bad luck to put a hat on a bed.

1183
01:25:32,214 --> 01:25:33,414
In France?

1184
01:25:34,216 --> 01:25:35,478
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

1185
01:25:35,521 --> 01:25:37,286
We don't have anything
like that in America.

1186
01:25:37,306 --> 01:25:38,611
You can put hats anywhere.

1187
01:25:38,655 --> 01:25:40,700
Oh God, I'm so sorry, forgive me.

1188
01:25:40,744 --> 01:25:42,485
It's okay.

1189
01:25:51,668 --> 01:25:53,737
That's enough of your
secret girl talk, please.

1190
01:25:53,757 --> 01:25:55,367
Speak in American.

1191
01:25:59,502 --> 01:26:01,678
I know French, I know French.

1192
01:26:33,275 --> 01:26:37,714
It's unspeakably heartbreaking
sometimes, this life.

1193
01:26:39,368 --> 01:26:43,023
But unspeakably
magnificent sometimes too.

1194
01:26:43,067 --> 01:26:44,547
I'll call you later?

1195
01:26:44,590 --> 01:26:46,244
What are you talking about?

1196
01:26:46,288 --> 01:26:48,420
Well, I just assumed
you'd want some space.

1197
01:26:48,464 --> 01:26:50,030
I don't want space.

1198
01:26:50,074 --> 01:26:51,815
I want to go fast now.

1199
01:26:53,164 --> 01:26:55,949
I don't want to waste time anymore.

1200
01:26:59,126 --> 01:27:01,128
Does it want to dance?

1201
01:27:22,019 --> 01:27:23,934
This town's incredible.

1202
01:27:29,331 --> 01:27:32,116
What are you most afraid of?

1203
01:27:32,159 --> 01:27:33,073
That because the last thing

1204
01:27:33,117 --> 01:27:34,901
on the face of the earth that

1205
01:27:34,945 --> 01:27:36,753
I want to do is Tweet or
update my Facebook status,

1206
01:27:36,773 --> 01:27:38,407
that the soul of youth will vomit me

1207
01:27:38,427 --> 01:27:41,299
into the cesspool of the
old and the worthless.

1208
01:27:41,343 --> 01:27:43,432
Come on, seriously.

1209
01:27:43,475 --> 01:27:44,675
Seriously.

1210
01:27:48,524 --> 01:27:50,613
You want me to be honest?

1211
01:27:52,441 --> 01:27:53,987
I'm afraid that because it's been

1212
01:27:54,007 --> 01:27:56,793
so long since I've been in
love, that I'll be so excited,

1213
01:27:56,836 --> 01:27:57,968
I won't see that I've fallen in love

1214
01:27:58,011 --> 01:28:01,406
with someone who might betray me.

1215
01:28:01,450 --> 01:28:03,408
Betray you how?

1216
01:28:03,452 --> 01:28:06,150
Fuck around on me, cheat on me.

1217
01:28:06,193 --> 01:28:08,108
I couldn't handle that.

1218
01:28:08,152 --> 01:28:10,589
Freud said our fears are our wishes,

1219
01:28:10,633 --> 01:28:14,114
so maybe you'll be the one
who will be the betrayer.

1220
01:28:14,158 --> 01:28:15,159
No.

1221
01:28:15,202 --> 01:28:17,466
I don't lie, I told you that.

1222
01:28:21,383 --> 01:28:23,472
Anything else?

1223
01:28:23,515 --> 01:28:25,822
Not off the top of my head.

1224
01:28:28,346 --> 01:28:30,348
What are you most afraid of?

1225
01:28:30,392 --> 01:28:31,610
You'll see.

1226
01:29:41,898 --> 01:29:44,335
Are you staying the night?

1227
01:29:49,340 --> 01:29:50,820
Uh, we'd love to.

1228
01:29:52,082 --> 01:29:53,282
Thank you.

1229
01:29:55,128 --> 01:29:56,328
Okay.

1230
01:30:09,491 --> 01:30:10,448
Is she okay?

1231
01:30:10,492 --> 01:30:12,798
Yeah, just tucked her in.

1232
01:30:24,680 --> 01:30:27,944
How long has you mom been like that?

1233
01:30:28,858 --> 01:30:30,425
Since I was 13.

1234
01:30:33,950 --> 01:30:37,257
That's when my dad gave
her the worst beating.

1235
01:30:37,301 --> 01:30:39,825
She's been like that ever since.

1236
01:30:42,785 --> 01:30:45,265
Did he ever hit you?

1237
01:30:45,309 --> 01:30:46,702
No, he adored me.

1238
01:30:50,967 --> 01:30:54,971
One day, you're daddy's little girl, and,

1239
01:30:55,014 --> 01:30:56,343
and the next day, you never hear

1240
01:30:56,363 --> 01:30:59,454
from the guy for the rest of you life.

1241
01:31:01,499 --> 01:31:04,328
She spent six months in a hospital.

1242
01:31:04,371 --> 01:31:06,025
I stayed with my aunt,

1243
01:31:08,158 --> 01:31:12,771
and I tried to live with
her when she came out, but,

1244
01:31:12,815 --> 01:31:14,991
she didn't know who I was.

1245
01:31:16,645 --> 01:31:20,910
So she was scared to have
me in the house with her.

1246
01:31:23,042 --> 01:31:26,176
Has she ever known who
you are since that happened?

1247
01:31:26,219 --> 01:31:27,419
No.

1248
01:31:28,221 --> 01:31:31,573
If she does, she doesn't
admit it to herself.

1249
01:31:34,010 --> 01:31:38,493
I think it would bring her
whole life back, you know?

1250
01:31:42,453 --> 01:31:43,628
It's like I'm here every week,

1251
01:31:43,672 --> 01:31:46,196
and every week it's the same dance.

1252
01:31:50,113 --> 01:31:52,245
Where do I know you from?

1253
01:31:57,599 --> 01:31:58,861
I'm so sorry.

1254
01:31:59,775 --> 01:32:00,975
It's okay.

1255
01:32:02,038 --> 01:32:04,736
You know, I still have her in a way.

1256
01:32:04,780 --> 01:32:09,698
Most people, you know, many
people don't have their mothers.

1257
01:32:09,741 --> 01:32:10,941
I'm grateful.

1258
01:32:14,093 --> 01:32:16,531
You think people find each other,

1259
01:32:16,574 --> 01:32:18,533
like water seeks its own level?

1260
01:32:18,576 --> 01:32:20,230
You have that saying in French?

1261
01:32:20,273 --> 01:32:21,473
No.

1262
01:32:22,624 --> 01:32:24,539
Do you think that broken people

1263
01:32:24,582 --> 01:32:26,366
find other people who they think

1264
01:32:26,410 --> 01:32:30,370
are gonna help give them
what they don't have,

1265
01:32:30,414 --> 01:32:32,309
and they in turn can
give the other person

1266
01:32:32,329 --> 01:32:37,334
what they think they need,
kind of help mend each other,

1267
01:32:38,770 --> 01:32:42,295
or, in a bad case, misguidedly
punish the other person?

1268
01:32:43,166 --> 01:32:44,733
Are you broken?

1269
01:32:44,776 --> 01:32:46,909
Do you think I'm broken?

1270
01:32:46,952 --> 01:32:49,433
I think everyone's broken.

1271
01:32:55,787 --> 01:32:58,877
I think you find what you find,

1272
01:32:58,921 --> 01:33:03,752
you know, and you do what you
do, and they do what they do.

1273
01:33:07,016 --> 01:33:08,887
I don't believe that people, you know,

1274
01:33:08,931 --> 01:33:10,933
really change that much,

1275
01:33:10,976 --> 01:33:14,980
really change over the
course of their lifetime.

1276
01:33:17,113 --> 01:33:19,008
So you just think it's
all random here on earth,

1277
01:33:19,028 --> 01:33:21,291
people meeting each other?

1278
01:33:23,641 --> 01:33:26,165
Why wouldn't God have a
hand in that equation?

1279
01:33:26,209 --> 01:33:30,692
I imagine he has better
things to do than match-make.

1280
01:33:32,302 --> 01:33:34,086
Like what?

1281
01:33:34,130 --> 01:33:35,392
I don't know.

1282
01:33:37,133 --> 01:33:41,137
I'll have my mother ask
him and get back to you.

1283
01:33:52,801 --> 01:33:54,846
I have a present for you.

1284
01:33:54,890 --> 01:33:55,673
You do?

1285
01:33:55,717 --> 01:33:56,935
Yeah.

1286
01:33:56,979 --> 01:33:57,849
It's not your proper Christmas present.

1287
01:33:57,893 --> 01:33:59,634
You'll get that tomorrow.

1288
01:33:59,677 --> 01:34:00,877
Okay.

1289
01:34:04,508 --> 01:34:06,075
Hold out your hand.

1290
01:34:07,685 --> 01:34:08,773
What?

1291
01:34:08,817 --> 01:34:11,733
Don't worry, I'm not gonna propose.

1292
01:34:12,995 --> 01:34:14,195
Yet.

1293
01:34:18,740 --> 01:34:21,394
It's our one-week anniversary.

1294
01:34:21,438 --> 01:34:26,443
Which romantically enough,
happens to fall on Christmas Eve.

1295
01:34:28,010 --> 01:34:29,210
Oh come on.

1296
01:34:30,186 --> 01:34:31,386
Okay, good.

1297
01:34:32,754 --> 01:34:37,019
I realize it's, it's
kind of an ugly ring.

1298
01:34:39,282 --> 01:34:41,719
But it's very special.

1299
01:34:41,763 --> 01:34:43,503
No, I love it.

1300
01:34:43,547 --> 01:34:45,549
You like it?

1301
01:34:49,074 --> 01:34:53,078
You said you'd be in
love with me by Christmas.

1302
01:34:53,122 --> 01:34:54,322
Was it true?

1303
01:34:55,733 --> 01:34:57,561
What do you think?

1304
01:34:59,868 --> 01:35:01,565
I think you are.

1305
01:35:05,438 --> 01:35:07,876
I think I just might be, too.

1306
01:35:12,141 --> 01:35:13,403
Wait!

1307
01:35:13,446 --> 01:35:14,360
What?

1308
01:35:14,404 --> 01:35:15,777
Where did you get the ring?

1309
01:35:15,797 --> 01:35:17,940
It's not from the, from
the gypsy lady, is it?

1310
01:35:17,973 --> 01:35:19,258
Yeah, she told me I was gonna

1311
01:35:19,278 --> 01:35:20,738
meet a girl to give it to, and I did.

1312
01:35:20,758 --> 01:35:21,541
It's graced.

1313
01:35:21,585 --> 01:35:22,760
No, it's cursed.

1314
01:35:22,804 --> 01:35:24,046
She cursed you, so the ring is cursed.

1315
01:35:24,066 --> 01:35:25,763
Come on!

1316
01:35:25,807 --> 01:35:27,460
The ring's not cursed.

1317
01:35:27,504 --> 01:35:29,312
And if curses exist,
that means God does, too,

1318
01:35:29,332 --> 01:35:30,899
and God beats curses every time.

1319
01:35:30,942 --> 01:35:32,901
Don't worry about it.

1320
01:35:36,643 --> 01:35:37,383
Wait.

1321
01:35:37,427 --> 01:35:38,627
What?

1322
01:35:39,777 --> 01:35:44,086
You don't want to know
if I'm, if I love you too?

1323
01:35:45,087 --> 01:35:47,306
Fuck, I hate this.

1324
01:35:47,350 --> 01:35:48,220
What?

1325
01:35:48,264 --> 01:35:49,744
I can't, I can't see you.

1326
01:35:49,787 --> 01:35:51,746
So fucking annoying.

1327
01:35:51,789 --> 01:35:54,096
Usually you see me when I'm that far.

1328
01:35:54,139 --> 01:35:55,662
I know, but it's night.

1329
01:35:55,706 --> 01:35:59,623
At night it gets worse,
it gets worse at night.

1330
01:36:00,798 --> 01:36:02,104
Close your eyes.

1331
01:36:03,845 --> 01:36:05,045
Close your eyes.

1332
01:36:10,634 --> 01:36:12,288
So do you want to know?

1333
01:36:14,029 --> 01:36:15,552
I already know.

1334
01:36:18,816 --> 01:36:20,339
What do you think?

1335
01:36:21,863 --> 01:36:24,648
I think you're in love with me.

1336
01:36:25,954 --> 01:36:27,303
Really?

1337
01:36:27,346 --> 01:36:29,154
But I don't want to have my eyes closed

1338
01:36:29,174 --> 01:36:32,047
when you say it for the first time.

1339
01:36:34,484 --> 01:36:35,790
Okay, open them.

1340
01:36:39,358 --> 01:36:40,558
It's a no.

1341
01:36:42,666 --> 01:36:44,320
That's really mean.

1342
01:36:46,148 --> 01:36:46,931
It's not.

1343
01:36:46,975 --> 01:36:48,175
Wow!

1344
01:36:54,547 --> 01:36:59,161
A lot.

1345
01:37:04,906 --> 01:37:06,168
Can I say that?

1346
01:37:07,734 --> 01:37:09,475
A lot.

1347
01:37:09,519 --> 01:37:11,913
I'm not touching that one.

1348
01:37:13,523 --> 01:37:18,528
You can say it any way you want,
just as long as you say it.

1349
01:37:55,217 --> 01:37:56,827
Merry Christmas.

1350
01:37:59,917 --> 01:38:01,440
Come visit any time.

1351
01:38:16,847 --> 01:38:18,980
He reminds me of François.

1352
01:38:21,765 --> 01:38:23,027
Who?

1353
01:38:23,071 --> 01:38:25,377
Your first boyfriend.

1354
01:38:25,421 --> 01:38:26,944
You were only seven years old.

1355
01:38:26,988 --> 01:38:30,643
You brought a boy home
after school one day,

1356
01:38:30,687 --> 01:38:31,973
and declared that you were going

1357
01:38:31,993 --> 01:38:35,257
to marry him because
he was your boyfriend.

1358
01:38:36,954 --> 01:38:39,130
I, I don't remember that, mom.

1359
01:38:39,174 --> 01:38:41,176
I do, as clear as day.

1360
01:38:43,439 --> 01:38:46,964
Michael is like François all grown up,

1361
01:38:47,008 --> 01:38:49,227
they have the same kind eyes,

1362
01:38:49,271 --> 01:38:53,231
and I can still see
the little boy in him.

1363
01:38:53,275 --> 01:38:56,104
That's the most important thing.

1364
01:39:09,160 --> 01:39:12,859
Didn't you tell me I
was your only boyfriend?

1365
01:39:12,903 --> 01:39:17,081
Well, not counting François, of course.

1366
01:39:17,125 --> 01:39:18,778
Oh, François.

1367
01:39:18,822 --> 01:39:19,997
And there was who else?

1368
01:39:20,041 --> 01:39:22,521
Probably Billy and fucking Frederic and?

1369
01:39:22,565 --> 01:39:24,132
No, just François.

1370
01:40:07,392 --> 01:40:11,005
Thanks a lot for bring
me to meet your mom.

1371
01:40:11,048 --> 01:40:13,181
That really meant a lot to me.

1372
01:40:13,224 --> 01:40:15,531
Thanks for coming.

1373
01:40:15,574 --> 01:40:16,880
So, what, you're gonna go

1374
01:40:16,923 --> 01:40:19,317
to your friend's house now for Christmas?

1375
01:40:19,361 --> 01:40:22,581
Yeah, they'd really like to meet you

1376
01:40:25,889 --> 01:40:28,022
and I'd love it if you came.

1377
01:40:29,197 --> 01:40:31,764
You sure you don't want to?

1378
01:40:31,808 --> 01:40:33,008
I'm sorry.

1379
01:40:34,550 --> 01:40:35,899
You understand, right?

1380
01:40:35,942 --> 01:40:37,292
Yeah, of course.

1381
01:40:40,730 --> 01:40:45,126
But, uh, I'd like to meet
you afterwards if you want.

1382
01:40:46,823 --> 01:40:49,260
Yeah, I'd really like that.

1383
01:41:05,276 --> 01:41:06,476
Thank you.

1384
01:41:40,181 --> 01:41:41,095
Hello.

1385
01:41:41,138 --> 01:41:42,792
Hey Josh, it's Michael.

1386
01:41:42,835 --> 01:41:44,576
Hey.

1387
01:41:44,620 --> 01:41:47,298
Sorry to call you on Christmas,
but I know you're a Jew.

1388
01:41:47,318 --> 01:41:48,972
Yeah, PlayStation with the kids

1389
01:41:49,015 --> 01:41:50,930
and then Chinese food.

1390
01:41:50,974 --> 01:41:53,107
Sorry I didn't call you
before the holidays.

1391
01:41:53,150 --> 01:41:54,195
I didn't want to bum you out,

1392
01:41:54,238 --> 01:41:56,240
honestly, right before Christmas.

1393
01:41:56,284 --> 01:41:58,112
Not good news, man.

1394
01:41:58,155 --> 01:41:59,591
Everyone has passed.

1395
01:41:59,635 --> 01:42:01,332
Everyone, absolutely everyone?

1396
01:42:01,376 --> 01:42:04,640
There's not one publisher
that didn't pass on my book?

1397
01:42:04,683 --> 01:42:06,642
No man, I'm sorry.

1398
01:42:06,685 --> 01:42:08,339
Hey, Merry Christmas.

1399
01:42:08,383 --> 01:42:10,385
Yeah, Merry Christmas.

1400
01:42:13,301 --> 01:42:15,041
Fuck!

1401
01:42:15,085 --> 01:42:16,478
Fuck!

1402
01:42:16,521 --> 01:42:17,740
Motherfuckers.

1403
01:42:18,523 --> 01:42:19,742
Motherfuckers.

1404
01:42:31,667 --> 01:42:33,147
Hello, Michael.

1405
01:42:33,190 --> 01:42:34,887
Can you do a session now?

1406
01:42:34,931 --> 01:42:37,281
It's Christmas, I'm with my family.

1407
01:42:37,325 --> 01:42:38,152
Yeah, I realize.

1408
01:42:38,195 --> 01:42:39,327
I'll pay you triple.

1409
01:42:39,370 --> 01:42:40,502
Can't you just leave for an hour?

1410
01:42:40,545 --> 01:42:42,199
I really can't.

1411
01:42:42,243 --> 01:42:44,201
I have a friend who I think you would

1412
01:42:44,245 --> 01:42:47,161
enjoy immensely if she
might do a session today.

1413
01:42:47,204 --> 01:42:49,337
Shall I call her for you?

1414
01:42:49,380 --> 01:42:51,034
Is she mean?

1415
01:42:51,077 --> 01:42:52,992
Almost as mean as me.

1416
01:42:53,036 --> 01:42:55,908
Trust me, she won't disappoint you.

1417
01:42:57,214 --> 01:42:58,414
Call her.

1418
01:44:14,465 --> 01:44:18,121
Did mistress Natalie
tell you what I like?

1419
01:44:19,340 --> 01:44:22,299
Just be really mean to me.

1420
01:44:22,343 --> 01:44:24,562
Like, really mean.

1421
01:44:24,606 --> 01:44:26,303
Verbally, physically.

1422
01:44:28,479 --> 01:44:31,569
You can slap me in the face really hard.

1423
01:44:31,613 --> 01:44:33,658
You can punch me in the face,

1424
01:44:33,702 --> 01:44:35,771
uh, but don't draw blood,
so don't punch me anywhere

1425
01:44:35,791 --> 01:44:40,578
where I would bleed, um,
like my nose or my mouth.

1426
01:44:40,622 --> 01:44:42,276
Don't leave any marks on my face.

1427
01:44:42,319 --> 01:44:44,321
Smother me, choke me.

1428
01:44:44,365 --> 01:44:47,455
You can, uh, use a plastic bag on me.

1429
01:44:49,195 --> 01:44:52,677
Put me in a sleeper hold,
but, uh, not till I pass out.

1430
01:44:52,721 --> 01:44:54,483
So right before I lose consciousness,

1431
01:44:54,505 --> 01:44:56,899
like, make sure I, you let go.

1432
01:44:58,161 --> 01:45:00,990
Say I'm a pathetic loser that no girl

1433
01:45:01,033 --> 01:45:02,972
will ever love and I'll
never get a girlfriend.

1434
01:45:02,992 --> 01:45:04,950
I'm probably just some
little loser faggot

1435
01:45:04,994 --> 01:45:06,909
that wants to get raped.

1436
01:45:07,823 --> 01:45:09,868
And then you can rape me.

1437
01:45:11,914 --> 01:45:14,525
Just tell me I deserve to die,

1438
01:45:16,745 --> 01:45:21,184
and that if I wasn't so
pathetic, you would kill me.

1439
01:45:39,855 --> 01:45:41,509
Hey, I'm so sorry I'm late,

1440
01:45:41,552 --> 01:45:43,404
but Santa and I had some
last-minute arrangements

1441
01:45:43,424 --> 01:45:47,384
preparing you present, which
you're gonna get later.

1442
01:45:47,428 --> 01:45:50,256
I don't want to see you anymore.

1443
01:45:51,083 --> 01:45:52,171
What are you talking about?

1444
01:45:52,215 --> 01:45:53,415
It's over.

1445
01:45:54,609 --> 01:45:55,871
It's not over.

1446
01:45:55,914 --> 01:45:57,089
What's over?

1447
01:45:57,133 --> 01:45:58,680
What are you, Sophie, What's going on?

1448
01:45:58,700 --> 01:46:00,528
It'll never work out between us,

1449
01:46:00,571 --> 01:46:04,227
and I don't want to
waste my time anymore.

1450
01:46:05,446 --> 01:46:07,297
Sophie, come on, don't
do this, not tonight.

1451
01:46:07,317 --> 01:46:09,319
It's Christmas, come on.

1452
01:46:10,538 --> 01:46:12,215
You start to like me a lot,
and then you freak out.

1453
01:46:12,235 --> 01:46:13,521
But it's, you don't have to do it, okay?

1454
01:46:13,541 --> 01:46:16,935
I'm not going anywhere,
I'm not going anywhere.

1455
01:46:16,979 --> 01:46:18,415
You're right.

1456
01:46:18,459 --> 01:46:22,376
It's because I like you a
lot that I'm running away.

1457
01:46:22,419 --> 01:46:24,943
I lied, I don't love you.

1458
01:46:24,987 --> 01:46:28,512
I don't care for you, I
don't even really like you.

1459
01:46:28,556 --> 01:46:31,559
You were like a distraction to me.

1460
01:46:31,602 --> 01:46:33,778
So please don't ever try to contact me,

1461
01:46:33,822 --> 01:46:36,041
or you'll have trouble you can't imagine.

1462
01:46:36,085 --> 01:46:37,285
Sophie!

1463
01:46:42,265 --> 01:46:43,465
Sophie.

1464
01:46:47,488 --> 01:46:50,534
What were you doing
tonight before you met me?

1465
01:46:50,578 --> 01:46:51,579
I was at Charles and Caroline's

1466
01:46:51,622 --> 01:46:53,276
for Christmas, you know that.

1467
01:46:53,319 --> 01:46:56,410
You were at Charles and Caroline's?

1468
01:46:56,453 --> 01:46:57,454
Yeah why?

1469
01:46:57,498 --> 01:46:59,935
All night, you never left?

1470
01:47:01,980 --> 01:47:03,180
No.

1471
01:47:04,156 --> 01:47:05,723
Why, do you not believe me?

1472
01:47:05,767 --> 01:47:09,901
Of course I believe you,
you never lie, do you?

1473
01:47:09,945 --> 01:47:11,145
Your turn.

1474
01:47:12,338 --> 01:47:13,252
My turn for what?

1475
01:47:13,296 --> 01:47:14,166
You get to ask me what I was

1476
01:47:14,210 --> 01:47:16,517
doing tonight before I met you.

1477
01:47:17,779 --> 01:47:18,606
I don't want to play this game.

1478
01:47:18,649 --> 01:47:21,043
Oh, come on you love games.

1479
01:47:22,610 --> 01:47:24,592
Ask me what I was doing
tonight before I met you.

1480
01:47:24,612 --> 01:47:25,351
No.

1481
01:47:25,395 --> 01:47:26,265
Ask me.

1482
01:47:26,309 --> 01:47:27,092
I don't want to.

1483
01:47:27,136 --> 01:47:28,336
Ask me!

1484
01:47:32,315 --> 01:47:35,492
What were you doing
tonight before you met me?

1485
01:47:35,536 --> 01:47:37,712
I was fucking another man.

1486
01:47:39,496 --> 01:47:41,933
We made love all night.

1487
01:47:41,977 --> 01:47:44,632
He made me come over and over,

1488
01:47:46,155 --> 01:47:50,115
and he's not insecure and
needy like you are, you know?

1489
01:47:50,159 --> 01:47:52,770
He didn't whine about how
I never touch his dick.

1490
01:47:52,814 --> 01:47:54,642
He did whatever he wanted,

1491
01:47:54,685 --> 01:47:58,210
just took my face in his hands
and made me suck his cock.

1492
01:47:58,254 --> 01:47:59,951
It was so nice.

1493
01:47:59,995 --> 01:48:03,738
He came so hard, I still
have it on my breath.

1494
01:48:06,175 --> 01:48:07,655
Can you smell it?

1495
01:48:08,830 --> 01:48:11,180
Does it smell like smitten?

1496
01:48:12,747 --> 01:48:13,947
Kiss me.

1497
01:48:15,663 --> 01:48:17,491
Kiss me and taste another man's cum

1498
01:48:17,534 --> 01:48:19,493
in your girlfriend's mouth.

1499
01:48:20,668 --> 01:48:22,670
Oh come on, have some.

1500
01:48:25,281 --> 01:48:27,065
Now do you believe me?

1501
01:48:46,258 --> 01:48:47,608
Hello?

1502
01:48:47,651 --> 01:48:50,175
Yeah, that girl you sent
me wasn't mean at all.

1503
01:48:50,219 --> 01:48:51,829
She wasn't?

1504
01:48:51,873 --> 01:48:54,702
Strange, usually she does as
much as people can handle.

1505
01:48:54,745 --> 01:48:56,051
No.

1506
01:48:56,094 --> 01:48:57,685
She just sat there, and
then after I told her

1507
01:48:57,705 --> 01:48:59,837
what I wanted, she just got up and left.

1508
01:48:59,881 --> 01:49:01,709

Hello?

1523
01:56:46,173 --> 01:56:47,373
Hello.

1524
01:56:49,524 --> 01:56:50,724
Come in.

1525
01:57:03,581 --> 01:57:04,781
Sit down.

1526
01:57:24,646 --> 01:57:27,779
So, what do you want me to do to you?

1527
01:57:35,439 --> 01:57:37,441
I want you to kill me.

1528
01:57:40,401 --> 01:57:43,360
You need to be very
careful of what you ask me

1529
01:57:43,404 --> 01:57:46,276
to do to you, because I will do it.

1530
01:57:50,106 --> 01:57:52,413
So I'm going to ask you again.

1531
01:57:53,327 --> 01:57:56,156
What do you want me to do to you?

1532
01:57:59,942 --> 01:58:01,944
I want you to kill me.

1533
01:58:12,607 --> 01:58:15,914
Why don't I play with you for a while,

1534
01:58:15,958 --> 01:58:20,093
and then we'll see if
that's still what you want.

1535
01:58:53,865 --> 01:58:55,065
Oui?

1536
02:00:16,905 --> 02:00:18,341
Do it.

1537
02:00:18,385 --> 02:00:20,169
Do what, Michael?

1538
02:00:24,913 --> 02:00:26,113
Kill me.

1539
02:00:27,916 --> 02:00:29,396
Micheal!

1540
02:00:38,927 --> 02:00:40,233
Are you sure?

1541
02:00:41,451 --> 02:00:43,410
You get no second chances.

1542
02:00:46,282 --> 02:00:47,482
Please kill me.

1543
02:01:00,296 --> 02:01:04,213
Is there any God you
want to say something to?

1544
02:01:06,171 --> 02:01:07,371
No.

1545
02:01:08,435 --> 02:01:12,526
Is there any person you
want to say something to?

1546
02:01:18,488 --> 02:01:19,688
No, no.

1547
02:01:22,362 --> 02:01:23,450
Just do it.

1548
02:01:23,493 --> 02:01:24,693
Just do it.

1549
02:01:25,539 --> 02:01:26,739
Please.

1550
02:01:27,497 --> 02:01:28,697
Okay.

1551
02:01:41,163 --> 02:01:42,363
Michael!

1552
02:01:46,255 --> 02:01:47,455
Michael!

1553
02:01:56,221 --> 02:01:57,421
Micheal!

1554
02:02:23,553 --> 02:02:25,381
Dear Sophie, do you remember

1555
02:02:25,425 --> 02:02:26,469
when I told you that there was something

1556
02:02:26,513 --> 02:02:27,905
that I would tell you one day

1557
02:02:27,949 --> 02:02:28,689
that I thought when I first saw you?

1558
02:02:28,732 --> 02:02:30,343
Micheal!

1559
02:02:30,386 --> 02:02:31,256
It was the clearest moment

1560
02:02:31,300 --> 02:02:33,389
I've had in my entire life.

1561
02:02:33,433 --> 02:02:34,936
You were picking oranges from a crate,

1562
02:02:34,956 --> 02:02:36,503
and I thought to myself that's the woman

1563
02:02:36,523 --> 02:02:39,003
I'm gonna spend the rest of my life with.

1564
02:02:39,047 --> 02:02:40,570
And that was the truth.

1565
02:02:40,614 --> 02:02:42,833
I love you Sophie.

1566
02:02:42,877 --> 02:02:44,574
And I know you love me too.

1567
02:02:44,618 --> 02:02:45,903
You're just too scared right now,

1568
02:02:45,923 --> 02:02:48,186
but I know that won't last forever

1569
02:02:48,230 --> 02:02:51,668
and, one day, you will
let yourself love me.

1570
02:02:51,712 --> 02:02:54,541
I will miss you so much until that day,

1571
02:02:54,584 --> 02:02:57,413
but I'll take solace in
knowing that when it comes,

1572
02:02:57,457 --> 02:03:00,416
even if it's when we're
120, I'll see you again

1573
02:03:00,460 --> 02:03:01,896
under the willow tree,

1574
02:03:01,939 --> 02:03:04,681
and that will be the happiest
day of my eternal life.

1575
02:03:04,725 --> 02:03:07,336
Until then, au revoir, Michael.

1576
02:03:18,565 --> 02:03:19,765
Melanie?

1577
02:03:28,792 --> 02:03:29,992
Michael!

02:03:33,841 --> 02:03:35,041
Micheal!

1579
02:05:29,913 --> 02:05:31,113
Wait for me.

1580
02:05:33,961 --> 02:05:36,746
Wait for me under the willow tree.

1581
02:07:43,220 --> 02:07:44,420
