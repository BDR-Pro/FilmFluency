We went

- ...you know, and we--

to go to this show.

57
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:00,907
"You gotta check out
one of these shows,"
and you know,

58
00:04:00,991 --> 00:04:03,242
it's-- it's a woman
fucking a horse.

59
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:06,454
We get there and, you know,
we think it's gonna
be awesome, and...

60
00:04:06,537 --> 00:04:09,332
it is not
as cool as it sounds
it would be, man.

61
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:11,375
It is-- it's--
it's kind of <i>gross.</i>

62
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:13,753
- Yeah.
- You think "A woman
fucking a horse,"

63
00:04:13,837 --> 00:04:15,546
and you get there,
and it's--

64
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,298
it's a woman
fucking a horse.

65
00:04:17,381 --> 00:04:19,843
- <i>Yep. </i>
- It was really
giving it to her.

66
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:22,637
<i>And you know what?</i>
<i>To be honest, I felt</i>
<i>bad for her.</i>

67
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,181
- We all just felt
bad for her.
- Yeah.

68
00:04:24,263 --> 00:04:26,432
- Kind of felt bad
for the horse.
- Wow.

69
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:28,267
- That's something.
- So did you, uh...

70
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:29,936
- what did you
get up to?
- <i>Um...</i>

71
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:32,647
uh, you know,
I just kind of hung out.

72
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:35,233
I was-- God, Friday,
when I went home,

73
00:04:35,316 --> 00:04:37,485
I <i>really </i>wanted
an egg salad sandwich,

74
00:04:37,568 --> 00:04:39,320
<i>and I was just obsessing</i>
<i>about it, I was like,</i>

75
00:04:39,403 --> 00:04:41,739
"Man, I'm gonna make
one of those," so--

76
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:43,700
so Saturday I went out
and I got...

77
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:47,996
like a dozen eggs,
I boiled them all,
and then I just...

78
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:51,624
I-- I spent-- I don't know,
probably three hours...

79
00:04:53,043 --> 00:04:54,544
like three
and a half hours making...

80
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:57,130
<i>you know, the mayonnaise</i>
<i>and the onions</i>

81
00:04:57,214 --> 00:04:58,840
<i>and paprika--</i>

82

you know,
all the <i>accoutrements,</i>

83
00:05:01,218 --> 00:05:03,720
and then by the time
I was done, I just really
didn't feel like eating it.

84
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:07,306
- I can imagine.
- And I didn't have
any bread.

85
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:09,600
So... you know,
it was pretty good.

86
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:12,311
- It was a good weekend.
- Sounds pretty awesome.

87
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:14,939
- Yeah, it--
it was fine.
- Sounds really fun.

88
00:05:16,315 --> 00:05:17,817
- Cool.
- Cool.

89
00:05:17,901 --> 00:05:19,861
Cool cool.

90
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:24,407
- Hey, Paula.
- <i>Yeah?</i>

91
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:26,117
I gotta tell you
something. I'm really
excited about it.

92
00:05:26,201 --> 00:05:29,120
Uh, for the first time,
today...

93
00:05:29,204 --> 00:05:31,372
I woke up, I came
to the store,

94
00:05:31,455 --> 00:05:34,709
and I-- I feel confident
to say to you

95
00:05:34,792 --> 00:05:37,087
that if you don't take
this Michael McDonald DVD

96
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,547
that you've been playing
for two years straight off,

97
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:42,800
I'm going to kill everyone
in the store and put
a bullet in my brain.

98
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:45,553
David, what do you
suggest we play?

99
00:05:45,636 --> 00:05:48,056
I don't care. Anything.
I would rather--

100
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:50,100
I would rather watch
"Beautician and the Beast."

101
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:52,393
I would rather listen
to Fran Drescher
for eight hours

102
00:05:52,476 --> 00:05:55,772
than have to listen
to Michael McDonald.
Nothing against him,

103
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:57,857
but if I hear
"Yah Mo B There"
one more time,

104
00:05:57,941 --> 00:06:00,401
I'm going to yah mo <i>burn </i>

00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:37,934
I'm dead serious.
Sometimes, I just
sit for hours

164
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:40,561
just staring
at the sky trying to come up
with something to do.

165
00:08:40,644 --> 00:08:43,440
I even don't know
if she can walk. I've <i>never </i>
seen her standing up.

166
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:45,233
I've only seen her
on her back.

167
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:47,318
- Wow!
- Yeah, that's sick, man.

168
00:08:47,402 --> 00:08:49,112
- Wow.
- That is not sick.

169
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:51,239
- I will give you sick.
- Oh, shit.

170
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:53,241
I was sleeping
with a woman recently.

171
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:55,076
She had-- her tits
were unbelievable.

172
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:58,079
Oh, man.
I love titties, so...

173
00:08:58,162 --> 00:09:00,581
And, uh...
so we're doing it,
we're about to finish

174
00:09:00,664 --> 00:09:02,500
and her dog starts
licking my ass.

175
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:05,378
- ( all laugh )
- I-I-I have to decide,

176
00:09:05,462 --> 00:09:08,465
- "Do I finish,
or do I stop the dog?"
- I know your nasty ass.

177
00:09:08,547 --> 00:09:09,799
- He finished.
- <i>I finished! </i>

178
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:12,176
And then I stole
the dog.

179
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,762
No, I didn't, but--

180
00:09:14,845 --> 00:09:16,764
You know, sometimes
Amy and I would make love--

181
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:18,975
it was almost like
we weren't two people,

182
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:21,185
but we were two...

183
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:24,605
spirits or something.
Our-- our souls were
connected in this way--

184
00:09:24,688 --> 00:09:26,732
I can't describe it.
Time stood still.

185
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:29,110
It was like we were
sharing the same heart.

186
00:09:29,193 --> 00:09:32,863
Stop! Man, why do you always
come and kill the vibe
with those things?

187
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:35,032
"Sharing the same heart?"
That's like some...

188
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:37,118
Britney Spears shit, man.
This is three grown ass--

189
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:38,953
don't nobody wanna
hear that shit!

190
00:09:39,036 --> 00:09:41,498
Yeah, man, come on!
Nobody wants to
hear that shit.

191
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:44,417
Thank you, Andy.
Dude, you-- you broke up
two years ago.

192
00:09:44,501 --> 00:09:46,669
- You like get over it
at some point.
- Two years, man.

193
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:48,671
You need
to get past that

194
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:51,966
because no ass is worth
thinking that much about...

195
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:54,927
- I always say.
- Andy, do me a favor?

196
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:57,138
Will you please help him
redeem himself,

197
00:09:57,221 --> 00:09:59,140
- by telling him
a real sex story?
- Yes.

198
00:09:59,223 --> 00:10:01,767
Uh... I don't--
you know what?

199
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:04,103
I'm-I'm a gentleman
and I don't--

200
00:10:04,187 --> 00:10:06,105
you know?
I don't kiss and tell.

201
00:10:06,189 --> 00:10:09,526
Fuck it. I raise you--
nastiest shit you've
ever done.

202
00:10:09,608 --> 00:10:12,611
- <i>I'm talking</i>
<i> about </i>nasty.
- Uh...

203
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:16,574
Wow. So many stories
are running through
my head right now.

204
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:20,870
I dated this girl...

205
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:24,541
for a while,
and she was <i>really </i>
a nasty freak.

206
00:10:24,623 --> 00:10:27,084
She just loved
to get down

207
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:30,338
with sex all the time.
She was like--

208
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:33,591
any time of day,
she was like, "Yeah,
let's go!

209
00:10:33,674 --> 00:10:37,011
- I'm so nasty!"
And I'd be nailing her...
- Oh, shit.

210
00:10:37,094 --> 00:10:39,055
...she'd be like,
"Ah, you're nailing me!

211
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:41,057
- Cool!"
- She talk dirty to you?

212
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:44,227
Oh, she loved
to dirty-talk.

213
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,604
Totally into it.
She'd be like,

214
00:10:46,687 --> 00:10:49,148
"Yeah, let's screw,

215
00:10:49,232 --> 00:10:52,569
let's--
I wanna fuck."

216
00:10:52,651 --> 00:10:54,945
God, it was so dirty.
She'd be like,

217
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:56,947
( high-pitched voice )
"Oh, me so horny.

218
00:10:57,031 --> 00:10:59,325
Me love you long time."

219
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:01,619
- So...
- Man #2: <i>So, what are</i>
<i> the titties like?</i>

220
00:11:01,702 --> 00:11:03,120
- Yeah, describe her, uh--
- Man #2: <i>Yeah.</i>

221
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:05,373
Oh, yeah, she had
great tits.

222
00:11:05,456 --> 00:11:07,750
Oh, no no no.
I mean like detail her.
Did she have like--

223
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:10,628
- you know them little
pink teeny nipples...
- Oh, yeah.

224
00:11:10,711 --> 00:11:12,880
- <i>...or the long "National</i>
<i> Geographic" nipples? </i>
- Long.

225
00:11:12,963 --> 00:11:15,049
Did you have
the bumpy brown nipple--

226
00:11:15,132 --> 00:11:17,385
- the Stevie Wonders?
- Andy: <i>Yeah, they</i>
<i> were nice.</i>

227
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:20,679
You know, when you--
you grab a woman's breast
and it's--

228
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:23,724
and you--
you feel it, and--

229
00:11:23,807 --> 00:11:26,685
it feels like
a bag of sand...

230
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:28,396
when you're touching it.

231
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:31,274
A bag of sand?

232
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:34,944
You know what I mean.
Why don't we just play?

233
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:37,238
- Why don't you just
deal the cards?
- Nuh-uh.

234
00:11:37,321 --> 00:11:40,575
- What are you talking about?
- Have you ever felt a breast
before, man?

235
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:42,368
- Yes.
- Dude, are you gay?

236
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:45,622
No, I'm not gay.
I've been with
tons of women.

237
00:11:45,704 --> 00:11:47,624
I touched a guy's balls
at Hebrew school once.

238
00:11:47,706 --> 00:11:49,584
Dude, it's not a big deal
if you like to fuck guys.

239
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:51,752
I'm cool.
I got friends
that fuck guys...

240
00:11:51,835 --> 00:11:54,004
- in jail.
- No, I'm not gay.

241
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:56,924
No, I've borked
a lot of women in my day.

242
00:11:57,007 --> 00:11:59,927
- You've "borked"?
- Hold on, hold on,
hold on.

243
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:02,179
Yo, answer this question.

244
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:04,474
Are you a virgin?

245
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:06,142
Are you a virgin?

246
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:08,727
Y-yeah, li--
not since I was 10.

247
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:11,439
It all makes <i>sense! </i>
You're a <i>virgin!</i>

248
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:13,107
I am n-- shut up.

249
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:15,818
- How does that happen?
- He's a fucking virgin.

250
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:18,154
Oh, knew it! That makes
so much sense, man!

251
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:20,281
- <i>He's a virgin! </i>
- You guys are hilarious.

252
00:12:20,364 --> 00:12:21,949
All right, guys.
Come on, don't be mean.

253
00:12:22,032 --> 00:12:23,660
I'm not being mean.
I'm trying to help the--

254
00:12:23,742 --> 00:12:25,828
I'm trying to say
I wanna get you laid, dude.

255
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:29,039
- I understand what's
going on with you.
- You guys are so...

256
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:31,959
- up your asses.
- From now on, your dick
is my dick!

257
00:12:32,042 --> 00:12:35,087
- I'm getting you some pussy.

You can do better
than that!

261
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:52,229
God, "me so horny."
No, me so <i>stupid!</i>

263
00:12:57,735 --> 00:12:59,654
Oh, come on!

( laughing )

265
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:05,576
It's gonna be fine.
They don't even remember.

266
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:07,953
Those guys are cool.

267
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:15,002
<i>( alarm buzzing )</i>

268
00:13:15,085 --> 00:13:17,171
This is gonna be bad.

269
00:13:22,259 --> 00:13:24,178
Come on!

270
00:13:27,097 --> 00:13:29,099
- Hey, David.
- Hey, Andy.

271
00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:33,896
- What's up?
- Cal, good morning.

272
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:35,732
Yeah, man.

273
00:13:39,569 --> 00:13:40,861
- Man: <i>Hey, Andy. </i>
- Hey.

274
00:13:40,944 --> 00:13:43,489
We're gonna have
to get you some punani.

275
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:48,202
Andy!
It's going <i>down, </i>partner!

276
00:13:48,285 --> 00:13:50,580
We're gonna be--
( grunting )

277
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:53,624
<i>This for you, partner!</i>
<i>This for you!</i>

278
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:55,793
Waves of it coming
at you on Friday,

279
00:13:55,876 --> 00:13:59,547
Saturday.
By Sunday your nuts
going to be <i>drained!</i>

280
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:03,342
Andy, don't let them
bother you. It's okay
not to have sex.

281
00:14:03,426 --> 00:14:05,553
Not everybody
is a pussy magnet.

282
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:07,597
You, uh--
what are you?

283
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,640
- 25?
- I'm 40.

284
00:14:09,724 --> 00:14:12,268
Holy shit, man,
you've got to get on that.

285
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:15,979
Life isn't about sex.
Life is about <i>children</i>

286
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:17,732
- and <i>passion. </i>
- Yeah.

287
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:20,568
- And <i>spirit. </i>
- Yeah, life's about passion.

288
00:14:20,651 --> 00:14:22,945
It's not about fucking
and balls and pussy.

289
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:25,322
It's about <i>love.</i>

290
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:28,492
It's about people.
It's about <i>connection.</i>

291
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:32,162
- It's all about connections.
- It's not about cock
and ass and tits...

292
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:34,081
- Mm-hmm.
- ...and butthole pleasures.

293
00:14:34,164 --> 00:14:36,083
It's not about butthole
pleasures at all.

294
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:39,086
It's not about
this rusty trombone
and the dirty Sanchez...

295
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:42,172
- Please stop.
- ...the Cincinnati bowtie...

296
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:44,883
- Mooj.
- ...and your
pussy-juice caulking

297
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:48,137
- and the shit-stained balls.
- Mooj, just please stop.

298
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,097
- It's relax--
- All right, that's enough.

299
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:53,183
Party's over.
Let the virgin
get back to work.

300
00:14:57,688 --> 00:14:59,982
Andy!
Andy, come on!

301
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:01,776
We were just kidding!

302
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:05,070
- Sorry.
- Andy, nobody cares
that you're a virgin!

303
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:06,823
Don't be such a baby!

304
00:15:06,905 --> 00:15:09,325
They were just having fun!
They didn't mean anything!

305
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:11,368
- Get away from me, David.
- Wait a minute!

306
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:13,120
- Stop following me!
- <i>Hold up.</i>

307
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:16,999
Andy:
Shit.

308
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:19,293
- Whoa.
- I'm gonna have
to quit my job now.

309
00:15:19,376 --> 00:15:21,920
- You don't have to quit.
- I don't wanna go out
with you guys!

310
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:24,256
- Fine. Okay.
- I don't need
your help!

311
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:26,300
All right. You don't
have to go out with us
if you don't want.

312
00:15:26,383 --> 00:15:28,427
I <i>respect </i>women,
I <i>love </i>women.

I respect them

00:15:56,413 --> 00:15:58,875
( tooting )

323
00:15:58,957 --> 00:16:03,045
- So how could this
not have happened?
- It just never happened.

324
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:06,048
When I was young...
uh, I tried,

325
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:08,676
and it didn't happen.
And uh...

326
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:11,178
then, I got older,
and I got more and
more nervous

327
00:16:11,261 --> 00:16:14,181
because it hadn't
happened yet,
and I got--

328
00:16:14,264 --> 00:16:16,559
kind of--
weirded out about it.

329
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:19,311
Then it <i>really </i>
didn't happen, and--

330
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:21,522
then, I don't know. I just
kind of stopped trying.

331
00:16:21,605 --> 00:16:24,191
Do you wanna
give it another shot?

332
00:16:24,274 --> 00:16:26,318
Maybe it's too late.

333
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:29,906
Bec-- I-- sometimes
I feel that it is just
too late for me.

334
00:16:29,988 --> 00:16:32,324
Oh... no, that's cra--
that's crazy.

335
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:35,578
You're 40 years old.
You know, 40's the new 20.

336
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:37,663
You wanna spend
the next 60 years
of your life

337
00:16:37,747 --> 00:16:41,291
never experiencing sex?
And not just sex,
but-- but <i>love,</i>

338
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:43,669
and a relationship,
and laughing, and--

339
00:16:43,753 --> 00:16:46,547
and cuddling
and all that shit.

340
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:49,466
I don't know, I--

341
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:52,553
- I wouldn't know what to do.
- Look, you gotta take a risk.

342
00:16:52,636 --> 00:16:56,181
You gotta risk it.
Look at me, I went out
with this girl for four months,

343
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:58,809
and it was the greatest--

344
00:16:58,893 --> 00:17:01,228
greatest thing in my life.

345
00:17:01,311 --> 00:17:05,441
Until she went
down on this guy in
an Escalade, I think.

346
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:07,568
And you know,
instead of like saying,

347
00:17:07,651 --> 00:17:10,654
"Okay, what I am doing
that caused this behavior?"

348
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:12,656
I dumped her.
Stupid decision--

349
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:15,284
I spent the last two years
of my life regretting it.

350
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:17,077
Then, why don't you
get her back right now?

351
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:19,663
Oh, 'cause she's
dating this pot dealer.

352
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:21,373
It's a stupid,
horrible decision.

353
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:23,333
But hey, that's
her journey, you know?

354
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:25,836
I gotta respect that.
I gotta give her the space.

355
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:28,714
If she wants to be some
immature, little bitch
and blow everybody,

356
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:30,758
that's--
that's love, man.

357
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:33,051
- That sounds horrible.
- Of course it's horrible.

358
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:35,220
It's suffering,
it's <i>pain, </i>and it's--

359
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:38,181
you know, you lose weight,
and you put back on weight,

360
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:40,267
and then you call 'em
a bunch of times,

361
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:42,519
and you're
trying to e-mail her,
and then they move,

362
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:45,439
they change their e-mail,
but that's just love.

363
00:17:45,522 --> 00:17:48,358
Do you realize that
this is the first time
we've spoken

364
00:17:48,442 --> 00:17:50,945
- for more than,
like, 30 seconds?
- Uh-huh.

365
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:54,907
- God, it's kind of nice.
- Come out with us
this weekend.

366
00:17:54,991 --> 00:17:57,159
No pressure,
we'll just have
a good time.

367
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:59,829
Okay, yeah,
I will.

368
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:01,831
- I'll give it a shot.
- Great.

369
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:03,958
But I am not
going to have sex
with anybody.

370
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:06,961
Good, sex should be
the <i>last </i>thing
on your mind.

415
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:32,815
Okay, look here.
So this is what's about
to happen, a'ight?

416
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:35,776
You're about to go run down
some drunk chicks, a'ight?

417
00:20:35,859 --> 00:20:38,278
Don't confuse that with tipsy.
We're talking about drunk.

418
00:20:38,361 --> 00:20:40,280
I want vomit in the hair,
bruised-up knees--

419
00:20:40,363 --> 00:20:43,200
a broken heel is a plus.
That's what you wanna
find, okay?

420
00:20:43,283 --> 00:20:45,285
- If things--
- No, Dave already
told me

421
00:20:45,368 --> 00:20:47,370
I didn't have
to have sex tonight.
And now he's gone, so...

422
00:20:47,454 --> 00:20:49,456
Dude, stop thinking
for a minute, a'ight?

423
00:20:49,539 --> 00:20:51,208
- You ain't got
the think on this one.
- Yeah?

424
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:52,960
All you got to do
is use your instinct.

425
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:55,754
How do you think
a lion knows to tackle
a gazelle?

426
00:20:55,838 --> 00:20:58,882
It's written.
It's a code written
in his DNA.

427
00:20:58,966 --> 00:21:00,926
- It says "Tackle
the gazelle."
- Okay.

428
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:03,053
And believe it or not,
in every man there's
a code written

429
00:21:03,137 --> 00:21:05,305
that says
"Tackle drunk bitches."

430
00:21:05,388 --> 00:21:07,307
N-- oh God,
you know what?

431
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:10,853
- I don't feel
comfortable...
- ( blows raspberry )

432
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:14,148
...hitting on drunk bitches.
You know, I don't think
that's right.

433
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:16,274
Okay. Hold on,
hold on, hold on.
Now, first of all,

434
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:18,527
you making it up to be
some kind of bad thing.

435
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:20,612
I didn't use "bitches"
in the derogatory
sense you did.

436
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:23,157
It just doesn't--
this doesn't feel <i>right.</i>

437
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:26,118
Of course, it don't
feel right. What has felt
right for you doesn't work.

438
00:21:26,202 --> 00:21:28,411
You need to try
some wrong, dawg.

439
00:21:30,497 --> 00:21:32,958
Okay, how do... I tell
which ones are drunk?

440
00:21:37,087 --> 00:21:39,422
So we just decided--
because this is
my last night

441
00:21:39,506 --> 00:21:42,009
as a free woman
before I marry Dan--

442
00:21:42,092 --> 00:21:45,762
that we would
just wig out!
We're wigging out!

443
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:50,100
You guys are hilarious.

444
00:21:50,184 --> 00:21:53,770
Whoa whoa whoa!
Wait a minute.
Yes yes, Mr. President?

445
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:56,232
Yes yes, the election
results are in.

446
00:21:56,273 --> 00:21:59,985
Hey, guys, look.
It's Dr. Seuss' penis.

447
00:22:00,069 --> 00:22:02,238
I really <i>mean </i>this.

448
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:05,241
Hey, everybody,
who wants penis cake?

449
00:22:05,323 --> 00:22:07,576
- I do.
- She does.

450
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:10,746
Hey, you guys,
Betty "Cocker."

451
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:12,206
( all laugh )

452
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:14,708
What a good guy.
What a-- Dan,

453
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:16,710
the guy Robin's marrying,

454
00:22:16,793 --> 00:22:19,171
is such a good guy.

455
00:22:19,255 --> 00:22:20,923
- He sounds
like a good guy.
- Oh.

456
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:23,466
I hated him
like for two years
'cause he cheated on me.

457
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:25,928
- Oh.
- But...

458
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:27,804
( moans )

459
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:30,348
he's really changed now.

460
00:22:30,432 --> 00:22:32,893
He's a really good guy now.

461
00:22:32,976 --> 00:22:36,939
- Your friend seemed nice.
- You have really kind eyes,
you know that?

462
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:39,066
Thanks, um...

463
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:41,277

00:22:47,657 --> 00:22:50,493
Mmm. Whoo.

466
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:57,000
- You have your hands
on my belt.
- What?

467
00:22:57,084 --> 00:22:59,128
- Your hands
are on my belt.
- I'm sorry.

468
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:02,505
- No, that's good.
- You're cute.

469
00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:05,467
This is kind of lame.
You wanna get out of here?

470
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:08,762
- Okay, yeah, so... ahem.
- ( giggles )

471
00:23:08,845 --> 00:23:09,763
Mmm.

- Mmm. Man! Fuck!
- Yeah.

Don't ever

Dan rhymes with man,

00:24:35,265 --> 00:24:36,892

Whoa! No! No!
Oh God! Out of the way!

00:25:47,254 --> 00:25:48,880
- Oh!
- Hey!

00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:52,008
Get off the wheel.
Jeez.

536
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:54,761
You're not gonna

Okay, here we are.

Oh God, we made it!

- Woman: Home sweet home.
- Yay.

545
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:17,117
- That fucker came

00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:21,788

- Whoa-- are you--
what's the matter?

549
00:26:33,716 --> 00:26:36,970
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, that's okay.

550
00:26:37,053 --> 00:26:39,515
I think I kind of
had that coming.

551
00:26:39,597 --> 00:26:41,683
I'll still have
sex with you,
if you want.

552
00:26:41,766 --> 00:26:44,520
You know what? I think
I'm gonna pass on the sex,
if you don't mind.

553
00:26:44,602 --> 00:26:47,189
At least I don't have to
work out tomorrow.

554
00:26:48,357 --> 00:26:49,649
Did you have
a daiquiri tonight?

555
00:26:49,732 --> 00:26:51,360
- <i>Yeah. </i>
- I thought you might.

556
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:54,279
It was a very bad night.

557
00:26:54,363 --> 00:26:56,323
- Whoo-ah!
- Yeah, laugh.

558
00:26:56,406 --> 00:26:58,741
You know what?
You guys wouldn't be
laughing right now

559
00:26:58,825 --> 00:27:02,371
if some girl had
just vomited shellfish
sandwich into your mouth!

560
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:04,998
- ( grunts )
- You know what?
You're right, it's my bad.

561
00:27:05,081 --> 00:27:07,501
Let me apologize
to you first of all

562
00:27:07,584 --> 00:27:09,169
for not mentioning
in detail

563
00:27:09,252 --> 00:27:11,421
that when you pick up
a drunk woman

564
00:27:11,505 --> 00:27:14,007
who's falling down
on her way out of the bar

565
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:15,675
that you should
probably drive.

566
00:27:15,758 --> 00:27:17,010
I drive a bike.

567
00:27:17,093 --> 00:27:18,887
Okay, Mr. Schwinn-
fucking-Armstrong,

568
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:21,139
who asked you
to drive a bike?

569
00:27:21,223 --> 00:27:23,850
You know what?
I'm not the only person in
the world who rides a bike.

570
00:27:23,933 --> 00:27:26,811
Yeah, everyone rides a bike--
when they're fucking six.

571
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:29,022
Why don't you
kiss something?

572
00:27:29,105 --> 00:27:31,983
Because this-- this is over
you guys, okay?

573
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:33,902
Can I just interject
for a second?

574
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:36,696
Let me just say, you are--
you are putting the pussy

575
00:27:36,779 --> 00:27:39,324
up on this pedestal.
You're just building
the pussy up.

576
00:27:39,408 --> 00:27:41,034
What are even talking about?

577
00:27:41,117 --> 00:27:42,869
"Building the pussy up."
What does that <i>mean?</i>

578
00:27:42,952 --> 00:27:45,663
You're making the pussy
into this great big

579
00:27:45,747 --> 00:27:47,749
Greek goddess
named Pussalia,

580
00:27:47,832 --> 00:27:50,460
and what you're doing is,
you're psyching yourself

581
00:27:50,544 --> 00:27:52,754
into thinking it's
some impossible feat.

582
00:27:52,837 --> 00:27:55,798
Yeah, I think you're right.
I'm putting the pussy
up on a pedestal.

583
00:27:55,882 --> 00:27:59,261
- <i>Right. </i>
- That's it.
It's Pussalia, right?

584
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:01,888
- Look where you going.
- I don't want to say
the word anymore.

585
00:28:01,971 --> 00:28:04,516
- Say what word?
- Pussy. I don't want
to say it.

586
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,476
Pussy is
a scientific word.

587
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:09,062
Dude!
New pants, man!

588
00:28:09,145 --> 00:28:12,649
You know what, Dave?
You said there wasn't
going to be any pressure.

589
00:28:12,774 --> 00:28:14,568
- We're not pressuring you.
- Excuse me.

590
00:28:14,651 --> 00:28:16,236
Can one of you guys
help me please?

591
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:19,072
- No hablo English, lady.
- Oh.

592
00:28:19,155 --> 00:28:21,324
I actually am helping
a customer right now.

593
00:28:21,408 --> 00:28:23,910
- Okay, well, um...
- I'm on break,

594
00:28:23,993 --> 00:28:27,247
but our stock supervisor
is very knowledgeable.

595
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:29,707
He can answer all
your questions and he'd
love to help you.

596
00:28:29,791 --> 00:28:31,918
- Oh, thank you.
You too.
- Have a nice day.

597
00:28:32,001 --> 00:28:35,338
Uh, great, okay.
Hi, I'm Trish.

598
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:37,799
Hi. Andy...is my name.

599
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:39,468
This one looks pretty good.

600
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:41,761
- You don't want
to buy that VCR.
- I don't?

601
00:28:41,844 --> 00:28:43,888
No, actually to be
totally honest with you,

602
00:28:43,972 --> 00:28:46,849
you don't want to buy any VCR.
It's a dead technology.

603
00:28:46,933 --> 00:28:50,103
- It's, you know,
like getting...
- What the hell?

604
00:28:50,186 --> 00:28:52,105
- ...an 8-track player...
- Yeah.

605
00:28:52,188 --> 00:28:55,651
or a beta-max.
Actually I'd recommend
this one.

606
00:28:55,733 --> 00:29:00,071
This is a dual.
You've got the VCR
and DVD combo.

607
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:04,117
So, you know,
that technology will probably
be pretty good for--

608
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,869
- Six months or so?
That's good.
- Yeah.

609
00:29:06,953 --> 00:29:09,080
At best.
Sorry.

610
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:11,583
- No no no.
- This is as good
as it gets.

611
00:29:11,667 --> 00:29:13,418
- Okay, that sounds
good then.
- Okay.

612
00:29:13,502 --> 00:29:15,795
- <i>Excusa, por favor. </i>
- Oh, sorry.

613
00:29:15,878 --> 00:29:18,507
Coming through.
Muchas gracias.

614
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:21,884
God, you know,
it's so funny. I work
right across the street,

615
00:29:21,968 --> 00:29:24,804
- and I've never
been in this place.
- Oh, really? Where at?

616
00:29:24,887 --> 00:29:26,598
The We Sell Your Stuff
On eBay store.

617
00:29:26,682 --> 00:29:29,767
Oh, that's the name?

618
00:29:29,851 --> 00:29:32,312
Yeah. Yeah, I was looking
for something...

619
00:29:32,395 --> 00:29:35,231
you know, obvious,
so I chose that.

620
00:29:35,315 --> 00:29:38,318
I don't understand.
So what-- you do what?

621
00:29:38,401 --> 00:29:39,986
I take the stuff
that you don't want,

622
00:29:40,069 --> 00:29:41,904
and then I "sell it"
on eBay.

623
00:29:41,988 --> 00:29:45,200
But you don't actually sell
anything in the store?

624
00:29:45,283 --> 00:29:47,494
No no, I don't.

625
00:29:47,577 --> 00:29:49,329
So why do you
have a store?

626
00:29:49,412 --> 00:29:51,581
( laughs )
I don't know.

627
00:29:51,665 --> 00:29:54,834
No, I think it's because,
you know, I wanna maybe
look professional

628
00:29:54,917 --> 00:29:57,879
and not like a crazy person
who's just going to steal
all your shit.

629
00:29:57,962 --> 00:30:00,465
Sure. I didn't mean
anything by that.

630
00:30:00,549 --> 00:30:02,676
No no, it's okay.
You know what?

631
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:05,011
You should come by sometime
if you want, you know?

632
00:30:05,094 --> 00:30:07,222
- All right, I'll--
- See for yourself.
Check it out.

633
00:30:07,305 --> 00:30:09,182
I'll check out
your empty store.

634
00:30:09,265 --> 00:30:11,768
Yeah, it's the one across
the street that's not empty.

635
00:30:11,851 --> 00:30:13,687
( laughs )

636
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:16,356
- Here's my number, so...
- All right.

637
00:30:16,439 --> 00:30:18,483
So just any time.

638
00:30:18,567 --> 00:30:21,403
Why do I need your number
if you're across the street?

639
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:23,279
Um...

640
00:30:23,363 --> 00:30:25,657
I don't really
have a good answer
for that, Andy.

641
00:30:25,741 --> 00:30:28,201
- Sorry.
- I'm just
giving it to you.

642
00:30:28,284 --> 00:30:31,287
So I'll write you up and meet
you over at the register.

643
00:30:31,371 --> 00:30:33,456
- Okay.
- Check you out--
check out.

644
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:35,375
- See you over there, okay.
- Okay.

645
00:30:35,458 --> 00:30:38,378
- Awful chatty.
- Hey, that-- I--

646
00:30:38,461 --> 00:30:40,589
look, I think she
gave me her number.

647
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:43,258
I mean, she wrote down
her number, but I think
she gave me her number.

648
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:45,385
Oh no, she gave you--
dude, see?

649
00:30:45,468 --> 00:30:47,429
- You still mad at me?
- I was never mad.

650
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:49,889
See what I mean?
We gonna celebrate, man!

651
00:30:49,972 --> 00:30:51,767
- This is pretty cool.
- Yeah!

652
00:30:51,849 --> 00:30:55,228
Give him some credit, man.
The man pulled a number.

653
00:30:55,311 --> 00:30:57,897
It's just, I was--
I can't believe
that happened.

654
00:30:57,980 --> 00:31:01,568
- What you did
was you zoned in.
- She just gave me her number.

655
00:31:01,651 --> 00:31:04,028
That's great, man.
I'm telling you

656
00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:07,115
- love is
a mysterious fig.
- It is.

657
00:31:07,198 --> 00:31:10,493
Okay, here's a question.
When should I call her?

658
00:31:10,577 --> 00:31:13,329
You like her?
Yeah, you definitely
don't want to call her.

659
00:31:13,413 --> 00:31:15,498
When is
the next Olympics?

660
00:31:15,582 --> 00:31:18,585
What you just got to do
is just get you a bunch
of these hood rats,

661
00:31:18,668 --> 00:31:21,379
run through them.
Just knock them out--
boom boom boom.

662
00:31:21,463 --> 00:31:24,090
And once you've done slayed
like 20-30 of them hood rats,

663
00:31:24,173 --> 00:31:26,802
now you're ready to go up
to the upper-echelon-type ho.

664
00:31:26,884 --> 00:31:28,595
- You know what I mean?
- I'm not a big ho runner.

665
00:31:28,678 --> 00:31:30,930
My uncle used to drive
a ho runner.

666
00:31:31,013 --> 00:31:33,057
Screw these analogies.
What he's saying is

667
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:35,143
you are going to be so bad
at sex the first time

668
00:31:35,226 --> 00:31:37,103
you don't want to have sex
with someone you <i>like,</i>

669
00:31:37,186 --> 00:31:39,272
because they'll think
you're a weirdo for being
so lame at it.

670
00:31:39,355 --> 00:31:41,524
You want to have sex
with "hood rats" first

671
00:31:41,608 --> 00:31:44,944
so that by the time you
get to the girl you do like,
you're not terrible at sex,

672
00:31:45,027 --> 00:31:47,196
you'll be mediocre at it.

673
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:49,365
Probably still
pretty bad, though.

674
00:31:49,449 --> 00:31:51,409
Put it up for my man
for pulling that number.

675
00:31:51,493 --> 00:31:53,703
- Way to go, man.
- Politicked his ass off.

676
00:31:53,787 --> 00:31:56,038
- He did politick.
- Thanks a lot.

677
00:31:56,122 --> 00:31:58,291
Like a train,
around the bend.
You ready?

678
00:32:08,551 --> 00:32:10,846
( coughs )

679
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:32,534
( coughs )

680
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:34,076
Yeah!

681
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,620
- I can't.
- Do it.

682
00:32:35,704 --> 00:32:37,664
- I can't pee in public!
- Gotta do it.

683
00:32:37,747 --> 00:32:39,999
- I've got
a mental block about it.
- Come on, do it.

684
00:32:40,082 --> 00:32:43,169
( yells )
I'm shy!

685
00:32:43,252 --> 00:32:45,755
( screams )

686
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:49,384
I'm peeing in public!

687
00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:51,969
- Let me out!
- I can't hear what
you're saying.

688
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:54,972
- I don't want to be in here!
- It's a sound-proof room.

689
00:32:55,056 --> 00:32:57,975
- Learn his techniques.
- Right on, man.

690
00:32:58,059 --> 00:33:00,729
You guys,
this is not funny!

691
00:33:12,615 --> 00:33:14,200
( sighs )

692
00:33:27,463 --> 00:33:29,925
( phone ringing )

693
00:33:32,134 --> 00:33:34,763
- Hello.
- ( groans )

694
00:33:40,017 --> 00:33:42,228
- Hey, what you watching?
- "Dawn of the Dead," man.

695
00:33:42,311 --> 00:33:45,607
- Great.
- Store is slow,
Paula's gone.

696
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:47,943
- Is Paula back?
- No no, she's not here.

697
00:33:48,025 --> 00:33:50,403
She said we can't
watch this in here.
You sure?

698
00:33:50,486 --> 00:33:52,488
Can I ask you something
in confidence?

699
00:33:52,572 --> 00:33:54,574
I know this is gonna
sound weird, um...

700
00:33:54,657 --> 00:33:56,492
am I good looking?

701
00:33:56,576 --> 00:33:59,287
Do you think a woman would
find me attractive?

702
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:01,581
Oh my God!

703
00:34:01,664 --> 00:34:03,583
Oh my God,
the blood just squ--

704
00:34:03,666 --> 00:34:06,085
- Okay, never mind.
- Whoa, wait wait, Andy.
Andy, hold up.

705
00:34:06,168 --> 00:34:08,838
This is embarrassing for me.
This is hard to talk about.

706
00:34:08,922 --> 00:34:10,966
- Are you ready
for my honest answer?
- Yes.

707
00:34:11,048 --> 00:34:14,886
Yeah. I think you're
a good-looking cat.

708
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:18,097
I don't think that anybody
knows it, and I don't think
anybody can see it.

709
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:22,018
That's why I'm asking you.
You seem really well groomed
and really put together.

710
00:34:22,101 --> 00:34:24,729
I mean, look dude,
you think this was an accident?

711
00:34:24,813 --> 00:34:27,607
- ( chuckles )
- All of this right here?
Premeditated, partner.

712
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:30,944
You got to highlight your
attributes. You're like
a diamond in the rough.

713
00:34:31,027 --> 00:34:33,947
- You willing to make
some sacrifices?
- Absolutely.

714
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:36,825
See that whole "Teen Wolf"
thing you got going
right there?

715
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:38,952
Just need to wax
that right out, boom.

716
00:34:39,035 --> 00:34:41,370
- Does it hurt?
- No, waxing don't hurt.

717
00:34:41,454 --> 00:34:44,123
I mean, not unless you're
a bitch, you know what I mean?
Didn't hurt me.

718
00:34:44,206 --> 00:34:46,584
I get it done all the time.
What the fuck?!

719
00:34:46,668 --> 00:34:49,462
Oh!
( laughs )

720
00:34:49,545 --> 00:34:52,007
Fuck that nigga up!

721
00:34:52,089 --> 00:34:55,301
Bitch, get out the room!
Bitch, get out the room!

722
00:34:57,428 --> 00:34:59,388
No, it's gonna be good.
It's gonna be good.

723
00:34:59,472 --> 00:35:02,558
- This is the one right here.
- Hi, how are you?

724
00:35:02,642 --> 00:35:04,769
So this is your first time
getting body wax?

725
00:35:04,853 --> 00:35:06,729
- Yes yes, it is.
- Take off your shirt.

726
00:35:06,813 --> 00:35:08,982
Okay.

727
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:13,361
Oh, we're gonna
need more wax!

728
00:35:13,444 --> 00:35:15,697
I'm staying.
This is gonna be good.

729
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:18,992
And clear
all my appointments
in the afternoon!

730
00:35:19,075 --> 00:35:20,660
Here we go.

731
00:35:20,743 --> 00:35:22,745
Oh, that feels warm.

732
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:29,752
Dave:
<i>I like your sweater.</i>
<i>Does that come in a V-neck?</i>

733
00:35:29,836 --> 00:35:34,131
Cal:
<i>If she starts doing</i>
<i>his pubes, I'm out of here.</i>

734
00:35:34,215 --> 00:35:36,217
Jay:
<i>You're gonna look good</i>
<i>after this, man.</i>

735
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,553
- Thanks, man.
- So, ready?

736
00:35:38,636 --> 00:35:40,513
Yeah.

737
00:35:40,596 --> 00:35:42,807
<i>Ich, ni, san.</i>

738
00:35:42,891 --> 00:35:46,519
( groans )
You fucker!

739
00:35:46,602 --> 00:35:48,980
Oh! I'm sorry.

740
00:35:49,064 --> 00:35:50,690
I'm sorry.
That's just your job.

741
00:35:50,773 --> 00:35:53,026
- Do you want
to stop now?
- No no no no.

742
00:35:53,109 --> 00:35:55,111
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

743
00:35:55,194 --> 00:35:56,863
( whimpers )
Let's do another.

744
00:35:56,946 --> 00:35:58,781
That one little patch
looks sexy, though.

745
00:35:58,865 --> 00:36:01,117
- Does it look good?
- Cal: Yeah, it looks
really good.

746
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,953
- ( groaning )
- Dave: It looks man-tastic.

747
00:36:05,663 --> 00:36:07,540
Andy: <i>Okay.</i>

748
00:36:07,623 --> 00:36:10,167
Whoo, wow. I didn't
expect that at all.

749
00:36:10,251 --> 00:36:12,336
I really
didn't expect that.

750
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:15,381
Jay: <i>You got it.</i>
<i>The first one's the only</i>
<i>one that hurts.</i>

751
00:36:15,464 --> 00:36:17,466
Yeah, well those hairs
are pretty deep.

752
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:19,677
- Okay.
- You ready?

753
00:36:19,761 --> 00:36:22,055
- Yup.
- <i>Ich, ni, san.</i>

754
00:36:22,138 --> 00:36:26,142
( yelling )
Cocksucker motherfucker!

755
00:36:26,225 --> 00:36:29,228
You shithead!
Oh, I hate you!

756
00:36:29,311 --> 00:36:31,564
<i>I hate you so much!</i>

757
00:36:31,647 --> 00:36:33,399
That one hurt.

758
00:36:33,482 --> 00:36:35,568
That one hurt just as much
as the first one.

759
00:36:35,651 --> 00:36:37,570
- That's great, man.
- Andy: <i>Man!</i>

760
00:36:37,653 --> 00:36:39,572
( breathing heavily )

761
00:36:39,655 --> 00:36:42,742
One, two, three.

762
00:36:42,825 --> 00:36:47,329
( screaming )
Fuck me

763
00:36:47,413 --> 00:36:50,959
in the asshole!

764
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:53,962
- Wow-wee!
- I'm sorry.

765
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:56,131
I'm sorry. I really
don't swear this much.

766
00:36:56,213 --> 00:36:58,507
You know what?
I got a weak stomach,
that's all I can take.

767
00:36:58,591 --> 00:37:00,176
- I'll se y'all.
- <i>Jay? Jay?</i>

768
00:37:00,259 --> 00:37:01,844
Be tough, Andy!
You got it!

769
00:37:01,928 --> 00:37:03,846
- Where did Jay go?
- Dave: <i>He went to throw up.</i>

770
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:05,306
- Ready?
- Yup.

771
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:08,267
- One, two...
- ( all gasp )

772
00:37:08,350 --> 00:37:10,853
Cocksucker
Motherfucker!

773
00:37:10,937 --> 00:37:13,272
You pulled on two!
You pulled on two!

774
00:37:13,355 --> 00:37:15,191
Why didn't you
pull on three?

775
00:37:15,274 --> 00:37:18,194
Sweaty pie-hole!
<i>Cómo se llama?</i>

776
00:37:18,277 --> 00:37:20,279
Oh, Kelly Clarkson!

777
00:37:20,362 --> 00:37:22,323
And three!

778
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:27,620
- Y'all done?
- <i>( Andy screams )</i>

779
00:37:27,703 --> 00:37:29,872
- That's fucked up.
Oh, that's fucked up.
- Andy: <i>Shit! balls!</i>

780
00:37:29,956 --> 00:37:32,792
- Two.
- ( screams )

781
00:37:32,875 --> 00:37:34,585
I hate you!

782
00:37:34,669 --> 00:37:37,338
I hate you!
Stop smiling, you jerk!

783
00:37:37,421 --> 00:37:39,924
- You pussy.
- Oh God!

784
00:37:40,008 --> 00:37:42,885
What's next?
Oh, you're doing the nipple.

785
00:37:42,969 --> 00:37:44,929
- Oh, not the nipple.
- Not the nipple.

786
00:37:45,013 --> 00:37:47,015
Please, Cal,
hold my hand.

787
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:50,726
- You kidding me, man?
- Hold my goddamn hand, man!

788
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:53,146
Do it!
Just hol-- okay,
here we go.

789
00:37:53,229 --> 00:37:55,231
- ( grunting )
- Ready?

790
00:37:55,314 --> 00:37:57,566
Oh no.
Yup. Yup.

791
00:37:57,650 --> 00:37:59,944
One, two, three.

792
00:38:00,028 --> 00:38:02,738
( screams )
Oh nipple fuck!

793
00:38:02,822 --> 00:38:06,325
Oh, Mika, you should
burn in hell!

794
00:38:06,408 --> 00:38:09,204
Okay, all right.
No seriously, I think I'm done.

795
00:38:09,286 --> 00:38:11,914
I think we're done.
I think that's good.

796
00:38:11,998 --> 00:38:13,708
( pants )

797
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:15,334
You know what, guys?

798
00:38:15,417 --> 00:38:17,837
<i>This </i>is not
a good look for me!

799
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,672
You look like
a man-o-lantern.

800
00:38:19,755 --> 00:38:22,258
- Thank you very much.
I appreciate it.
- Thank you.

801
00:38:37,273 --> 00:38:38,691
( yells )

802
00:38:40,776 --> 00:38:44,321
- Can you get--
thank you very much.
- Woman: Thank you.

803
00:38:44,405 --> 00:38:47,867
Andy, I owe you
an apology, man.

804
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:49,869
I wasn't very nice
to you for the past

805
00:38:49,952 --> 00:38:52,080
- like two and a half years.
- You were nice to me.

806
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:54,540
No, I wasn't.
I thought you were
really boring

807
00:38:54,623 --> 00:38:57,210
and I kind of thought
you were a serial killer.

808
00:38:57,293 --> 00:38:59,503
- ( laughs )
- I'm not joking.

809
00:38:59,587 --> 00:39:03,049
Look, you shouldn't listen
to Dave and Jay, okay?

810
00:39:03,132 --> 00:39:05,509
Those guys are crazy.
You should listen to me.

811
00:39:05,593 --> 00:39:08,387
Okay, look,
there's a hot-ass girl

812
00:39:08,470 --> 00:39:10,265
who works right there.
There she is, in the bookstore.

813
00:39:10,347 --> 00:39:11,640
<i>You should ask</i>
<i>her out, man.</i>

814
00:39:14,435 --> 00:39:16,729
There's something wrong
with her underpants.

815
00:39:16,812 --> 00:39:21,067
- Cal: <i>Yeah,</i>
<i> they're not in my mouth. </i>
- You know, I kind of...

816
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:23,278
like the woman
from the eBay store.

817
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:25,905
That's great, but you're
not gonna get with anyone

818
00:39:25,988 --> 00:39:27,698
unless you play
the odds on this, man.

819
00:39:27,782 --> 00:39:29,450
You need to plant
a lot of seeds.

820
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:31,702
It's like this,
when I was growing pot

821
00:39:31,786 --> 00:39:35,331
- I realized
that the more...
- Thank you.

822
00:39:35,414 --> 00:39:39,085
...seeds I planted
the more pot I could
ultimately smoke.

823
00:39:39,168 --> 00:39:42,630
I think I have all the advice
that I can handle right now.

824
00:39:42,713 --> 00:39:44,423
- Don't get bitter.
- I'm not bitter!

825
00:39:44,506 --> 00:39:46,634
I almost lost
a <i>nipple, </i>okay?

826
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:48,677
The problem
most men have is

827
00:39:48,761 --> 00:39:52,223
they just plain,
straight-up have no clue
how to talk to women.

828
00:39:52,307 --> 00:39:55,768
You just ask questions,
okay? That's <i>it.</i>

829
00:39:55,851 --> 00:39:58,020
Because women do not care

830
00:39:58,104 --> 00:40:00,439
about what you have
to say at all anyway,
you know?

831
00:40:00,522 --> 00:40:02,524
And all they want to do
is talk about themselves.

832
00:40:02,608 --> 00:40:04,819
So you're just gonna
let them do that, okay?

833
00:40:04,902 --> 00:40:07,863
So remember:
Questions, be cool

834
00:40:07,947 --> 00:40:09,615
and be kind of a dick.

835
00:40:09,698 --> 00:40:12,785
Here, be David Caruso
in "Jade."

836
00:40:12,868 --> 00:40:15,079
Okay, I know exactly
what you're talking about.

837
00:40:15,163 --> 00:40:16,831
You do?
That's good.

838
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:20,542
Cal:
<i>Oh, there she is.</i>

839
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:24,797
Go plant that seed, man.

840
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,966
Plant it
with your finger.

841
00:40:38,602 --> 00:40:40,188
Can I help you?

842
00:40:42,439 --> 00:40:45,151
I don't know,
can you?

843
00:40:45,234 --> 00:40:47,653
Are you looking
for something?

844
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:51,866
Is there something
I should be looking for?

845
00:40:53,034 --> 00:40:55,494
( laughs )
Um...

846
00:40:55,577 --> 00:40:58,164
well, we have
a lot of books,

847
00:40:58,247 --> 00:41:01,583
so maybe it depends
on what you like.

848
00:41:04,086 --> 00:41:07,464
What--
what do you like?

849
00:41:07,548 --> 00:41:11,093
We have a great,
um, section

850
00:41:11,177 --> 00:41:13,637
of do-it-yourself.

851
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:15,806
Do you like
to do-it-yourself?

852
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:18,351
Sometimes.
( giggles )

853
00:41:18,434 --> 00:41:20,936
I mean, if the...

854
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:23,856
mood strikes.

855
00:41:23,939 --> 00:41:26,359
How is the mood
striking you now?

856
00:41:26,442 --> 00:41:28,652
( both laughing )

857
00:41:33,241 --> 00:41:35,076
What's your name?

858
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:36,660
What's <i>your </i>name?

859
00:41:36,744 --> 00:41:39,496
I'm, uh, Beth.

860
00:41:41,707 --> 00:41:43,834
Andy.

861
00:41:43,918 --> 00:41:45,794
Andy?

862
00:41:47,546 --> 00:41:49,465
Don't tell on me,
okay, Andy?

863
00:41:49,548 --> 00:41:51,675
I won't.

864
00:41:51,759 --> 00:41:54,678
Unless you want
to be told on...

865
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:56,222
Beth.

866
00:41:56,305 --> 00:41:59,058
( giggles )

867
00:41:59,141 --> 00:42:02,561
Wow, that totally worked!
I literally said nothing
and she found me fascinating.

868
00:42:02,644 --> 00:42:05,522
- I would have thought you
were doing that for years.
- Should I have asked her out?

869
00:42:05,606 --> 00:42:08,192
No, that's the key.
You wait for her to grow
into a plant

870
00:42:08,276 --> 00:42:09,902
and then you <i>fuck </i>
the plant.

871
00:42:13,655 --> 00:42:16,742
Okay.
This is easy.

872
00:42:17,868 --> 00:42:19,828
All right.
All right.

873
00:42:19,912 --> 00:42:21,456
Hello, Trish.
How you doing?

874
00:42:21,538 --> 00:42:24,041
What's going on?
( laughs )

875
00:42:24,125 --> 00:42:27,128
Good joke.
Oh, this is a fun
conversation.

876
00:42:27,211 --> 00:42:29,630
Just grow a backbone
and call her.

877
00:42:29,713 --> 00:42:32,425
She asked you to call her.
She wants you to call her.

878
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:37,846
- <i>( line ringing ) </i>
- ( breathes deep )

879
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:40,099
- ( phone ringing )
- Hello.

880
00:42:40,182 --> 00:42:41,976
Hey, how you doing?

881
00:42:42,059 --> 00:42:45,980
- Um, how you doing?
- <i>I'm well.</i>

882
00:42:46,063 --> 00:42:47,982
<i>Who is this?</i>

883
00:42:48,065 --> 00:42:50,109
This is James.

884
00:42:50,192 --> 00:42:53,028
- <i>James?</i>
<i> Do I know you, James? </i>
- ( groans )

885
00:42:53,112 --> 00:42:55,281
I was wondering whether
you had a few minutes

886
00:42:55,364 --> 00:42:57,116
to talk about, uh,
laundry detergent.

887
00:42:57,199 --> 00:42:59,535
Are you
a telemarketer, James?

888
00:42:59,618 --> 00:43:02,121
- Yeah.
- <i>Are you at the top</i>
<i> of a tall building?</i>

889
00:43:02,204 --> 00:43:04,623
<i>Can you get</i>
<i>to a roof quickly?</i>
<i>Jump off!</i>

890
00:43:04,706 --> 00:43:07,709
I mean, you people are sick.
Get a real fucking job
why don't you?

891
00:43:07,793 --> 00:43:09,504
<i>Go shoot yourself</i>
<i>in the fucking head!</i>

892
00:43:09,586 --> 00:43:11,713
Hey, why don't you
just get a knife
and run into it?

893
00:43:11,797 --> 00:43:13,590
- <i>Why don't you do that? </i>
- Okay.

894
00:43:13,674 --> 00:43:15,634
- <i>I'll see you later, James. </i>
- Nice to talk to you.

895
00:43:15,717 --> 00:43:18,012
<i>Fuck your mother, okay?</i>
<i>Bye-bye.</i>

896
00:43:20,306 --> 00:43:22,183
- ( groans )
- <i>( doorbell rings )</i>

897
00:43:24,226 --> 00:43:26,479
Hey man, got a big
box of porn for you.

898
00:43:26,562 --> 00:43:28,105
Oh.

899
00:43:28,189 --> 00:43:31,233
- Can I come in?
- Uh, yeah yeah.

900
00:43:31,317 --> 00:43:34,570
( sighs )
Sweet video game chair.

901
00:43:34,653 --> 00:43:36,989
So, um...

902
00:43:38,115 --> 00:43:39,534
so what's in the box?

903
00:43:39,616 --> 00:43:41,577
It's my personal collection
of erotica.

904
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:43,996
- Oh.
- <i>I want to</i>
<i> give it to you.</i>

905
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:46,165
I think there may be
a few tapes in there
that just might

906
00:43:46,248 --> 00:43:48,000
open up Pandora's
box of love.

907
00:43:48,083 --> 00:43:50,252
- Oh, okay.
- Amy and I,

908
00:43:50,336 --> 00:43:52,547
we used to watch
"Harry Twatter."

909
00:43:52,629 --> 00:43:55,883
And we'd put it on
the television then act
it out as it was going on.

910
00:43:55,966 --> 00:43:58,177
<i>And it was--</i>
<i>it was all right.</i>

911
00:43:58,260 --> 00:44:01,096
( chuckling )
She was adorable.

912
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:03,599
Fucking bitch.

913
00:44:03,682 --> 00:44:07,061
Well, you know, this is
really gracious and kind
generous and everything,

914
00:44:07,144 --> 00:44:09,813
but I just don't want
a big box of porn
in my apartment.

915
00:44:09,897 --> 00:44:12,066
There's some really
great stuff in here.

916
00:44:12,149 --> 00:44:14,860
<i>Really great great</i>
<i>movies in here, man.</i>

917
00:44:14,943 --> 00:44:17,196
- Did you ever see
"School of Rock"?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

918
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:19,698
Well this is--
it's called "School of--"

919
00:44:19,781 --> 00:44:22,701
- you know.
- Oh, that's nice.

920
00:44:22,784 --> 00:44:25,037
But it stars
Jack Blackcock.

921
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:26,788
Oh, that makes sense.

922
00:44:26,872 --> 00:44:28,999
Dude, here it is.

923
00:44:29,083 --> 00:44:31,377
"Boner Jams '03."
It's a mix tape I made.

924
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:33,962
All these great scenes
that I was really into

925
00:44:34,046 --> 00:44:36,549
in the summer of 2003.
I think you'd really dig it.

926
00:44:36,632 --> 00:44:38,384
Yeah, I can see that.

927
00:44:38,467 --> 00:44:42,638
This is...
"Everybody Loves Raymond."

928
00:44:42,721 --> 00:44:45,600
That's probably not supposed--
that's just a good show.
I tape it sometimes.

929
00:44:45,682 --> 00:44:49,103
I don't think you
understand something, Dave.
I don't want this stuff, okay?

930
00:44:49,186 --> 00:44:52,064
Because I don't do
<i>that </i>that much.

931
00:44:52,147 --> 00:44:54,233
- What, masturbate?
- Yeah.

932
00:44:54,316 --> 00:44:57,736
Are you-- dude,
I've jacked it twice
since I've been here.

933
00:44:57,819 --> 00:45:00,281
- <i>Are you kidding me?</i>
<i> Why not? </i>
- It's not a hobby of mine.

934
00:45:00,364 --> 00:45:02,575
Well, then that's the only
hobby you don't have.

935
00:45:02,658 --> 00:45:05,327
Ha-ha-ha.
No, seriously, I just don't
feel comfortable talking--

936
00:45:05,411 --> 00:45:07,413
You need to.
You're wound up.

937
00:45:07,496 --> 00:45:09,873
You're like action figures,
hermetically sealed
in your box.

938
00:45:09,957 --> 00:45:12,167
- You got to play with--
- Don't! Don't!

939
00:45:12,251 --> 00:45:14,711
Don't! Don't take it out!
I'm sorry.

940
00:45:14,795 --> 00:45:16,713
You know what?
It's just...

941
00:45:16,797 --> 00:45:19,425
it loses it's value if you
take it out of it's packaging.

942
00:45:19,508 --> 00:45:21,760
I'm just saying let it out.
Give it some air, man.

943
00:45:21,843 --> 00:45:24,054
- Play with it.
- Take your porn with you.

944
00:45:24,138 --> 00:45:27,099
- I'm not taking it.
- Take your box of porn!

945
00:45:27,182 --> 00:45:30,269
- That is my gift to you.
- No, I don't want it.

946
00:45:30,352 --> 00:45:32,938
- David, it's not--
- ( yelling ) Andy,
for the last time,

947
00:45:33,021 --> 00:45:35,023
I don't want your giant
box of pornography!

948
00:45:35,107 --> 00:45:38,527
No no, shh!
Come on, man.
That is so uncool.

949
00:45:38,611 --> 00:45:40,613
Uncool?!

950
00:45:40,696 --> 00:45:43,240
Uncool is trying
to give an honest man

951
00:45:43,324 --> 00:45:45,660
a big box of porn, Andy!

952
00:45:45,742 --> 00:45:47,495
Dave:

It's nothing official.

969
00:47:02,194 --> 00:47:06,407
Just a little token
of my appreciation.

970
00:47:14,331 --> 00:47:18,043
Eww! Okay.
Okay, new tape.

971
00:47:18,126 --> 00:47:20,003
<i>( laughing on TV )</i>

972
00:47:20,087 --> 00:47:22,423
Nothing is ever good enough
and it's always our fault!

973
00:47:22,506 --> 00:47:24,299
You can't speak to your
mother like that!

974
00:47:24,383 --> 00:47:26,927
- You do.
- She's not my mother!

975
00:47:33,850 --> 00:47:36,771
This right here,
you're looking at the Bentley
of big-screen TVs.

976
00:47:36,853 --> 00:47:39,940
This is the Rolls-Royce
of big-screen-- oh Jeez!

977
00:47:40,023 --> 00:47:43,235
- Dude.
- Sometimes I think these
butterflies are in here.

978
00:47:45,195 --> 00:47:46,947
Hey, Andy, what are you
doing for lunch?

979
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:49,283
Um, I don't know.
I have a turkey sandwich.

980
00:47:49,366 --> 00:47:52,536
We're gonna go around
the corner. I think you
should come with us.

981
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:55,831
There's this great place.
Lot of cute girls.

982
00:47:55,914 --> 00:47:57,625
I don't know.
Okay.

983
00:47:57,708 --> 00:48:00,669
We brought you a shirt.

984
00:48:00,753 --> 00:48:03,046
This place
is pretty fancy.

985
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:05,006
Is something going on?

986
00:48:05,090 --> 00:48:08,385
- Hey, who's ready
to have some fun?
- ( crowd cheers )

987
00:48:08,469 --> 00:48:10,721
Hey, guys.

988
00:48:10,805 --> 00:48:14,141
Hey! No, don't ignore me.
I know what this is.

989
00:48:14,224 --> 00:48:16,769
Within one hour,
you'll each have 20 dates.

990
00:48:16,852 --> 00:48:18,937
Would you just quit
whining like a bitch?

991
00:48:19,020 --> 00:48:21,315
- I'm not whining
like a bitch.
- You <i>are.</i>

992
00:48:21,398 --> 00:48:24,860
Man, you're about
to cram like 10 years
of pimpage into one day.

993
00:48:24,943 --> 00:48:27,655
- I don't want
to cram pimpage.
- Partner, after that...

994
00:48:27,738 --> 00:48:29,657
you on my level.
Come on.

995
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:32,326
- Cal: <i>Just ask questions. </i>
- This is a bad idea.

996
00:48:32,409 --> 00:48:34,829
<i>( buzzer sounding )</i>

997
00:48:34,911 --> 00:48:36,497
- Hi.
- Hi, how are you?

998
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:38,999
I'm fine.

999
00:48:39,082 --> 00:48:41,084
Are you fine?

1000
00:48:41,168 --> 00:48:44,004
- Yeah.
- You're fine then?

1001
00:48:44,087 --> 00:48:46,381
Are you fucking retarded?

1002
00:48:46,465 --> 00:48:48,467
What the hell's
the matter with you?

1003
00:48:48,550 --> 00:48:50,803
- Do you want me
to be fucking retarded?
- <i>( buzzer sounds )</i>

1004
00:48:50,886 --> 00:48:53,930
When I look into the eyes
of the children
and the parents

1005
00:48:54,014 --> 00:48:57,768
and they're smiling and saying
"Thank you, Dr. Montalban,
you saved my child."

1006
00:48:57,852 --> 00:48:59,645
- Oh, it's worth it.
- <i>( buzzer sounds )</i>

1007
00:49:01,605 --> 00:49:03,231
Amy.

1008
00:49:03,315 --> 00:49:05,526
- What are you doing here?
- David.

1009
00:49:06,943 --> 00:49:08,445
And you are Gina?

1010
00:49:08,529 --> 00:49:10,531
"Jy-na."
Man, what's up?

1011
00:49:10,614 --> 00:49:13,241
- Nothing.
- Look, I'm gonna be
real honest with you.

1012
00:49:13,325 --> 00:49:16,203
It's been a long time
since I've been with a man.

1013
00:49:16,286 --> 00:49:19,206
<i>Spent a lot of time</i>
<i>with the ladies.</i>

1014
00:49:19,289 --> 00:49:21,750
Looking to get back up
on that pogo stick.

1015
00:49:21,834 --> 00:49:23,836
- You know what
I'm saying?
- Excuse me?

1016
00:49:23,919 --> 00:49:27,548
Remember that time
when we made love and you
cried in my arms?

1017
00:49:27,631 --> 00:49:30,300
Please don't reminisce about
the times we fucked. Please!

1018
00:49:30,384 --> 00:49:32,469
- It's so creepy.
- Let's go to Paris.

1019
00:49:32,553 --> 00:49:34,638
I want to take you
underneath the Eiffel
Tower and make love to you.

1020
00:49:34,722 --> 00:49:36,682
- Cut it out!
- Cut what out?

1021
00:49:36,765 --> 00:49:39,184
This. "Go to Paris."
We've been broken up
for two years, man.

1022
00:49:39,267 --> 00:49:41,353
- I don't want
to date you anymore.
- You're a whore.

1023
00:49:41,436 --> 00:49:43,731
I am not a whore.
I just didn't like you.

1024
00:49:43,814 --> 00:49:46,483
- This is so us.
- ( both laugh )

1025
00:49:46,567 --> 00:49:49,027
- Psycho talk.
- What?!

1026
00:49:49,110 --> 00:49:51,029
- You're a good-looking man.
- Thank you.

1027
00:49:51,112 --> 00:49:53,240
<i>Very pretty.</i>
<i>Real soft delicate features.</i>

1028
00:49:53,323 --> 00:49:56,243
They're real feminine,
which is good for me,

1029
00:49:56,326 --> 00:49:59,872
because that would be
a simple sort of transition,
you know what I'm saying?

1030
00:49:59,955 --> 00:50:01,749
Maybe throw
a little rouge on you,

1031
00:50:01,832 --> 00:50:03,876
<i>tuck your sack back.</i>
<i>You game?</i>

1032
00:50:03,959 --> 00:50:05,711
- No.
- <i>( buzzer sounds )</i>

1033
00:50:05,794 --> 00:50:09,715
You need to <i>stop </i>fucking
around with my friend, okay?

1034
00:50:09,798 --> 00:50:12,634
Because you're
giving him hope and it's
driving the man <i>crazy.</i>

1035
00:50:12,718 --> 00:50:15,763
I moved, I changed
my email address,
my phone number.

1036
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:18,599
- <i>He's practically stalking me. </i>
- Well, I didn't know all that,

1037
00:50:18,682 --> 00:50:20,392
- so I am sorry.
- <i>( buzzer sounds )</i>

1038
00:50:20,475 --> 00:50:22,310
Oh, I love Minnesota.

1039
00:50:22,394 --> 00:50:24,521
Woman:
<i>I grew up in a town</i>
<i>outside of Minneapolis</i>

1040
00:50:24,605 --> 00:50:27,441
with like a population
of like 500 people.
( chuckles )

1041
00:50:27,524 --> 00:50:30,402
- <i>Really small. </i>
- Yeah, it's like the land
of a thousand lakes.

1042
00:50:30,485 --> 00:50:33,113
What about you?
You're used to
a really big city.

1043
00:50:33,196 --> 00:50:35,783
<i>Really-- God, yes.</i>

1044
00:50:35,866 --> 00:50:37,743
<i>The town that</i>
<i>I grew up in</i>

1045
00:50:37,826 --> 00:50:39,787
was really small.
I mean,

1046
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:42,456
- it was just so safe.
There was no crime.
- Boob. Come on.

1047
00:50:42,539 --> 00:50:46,126
I mean, a girl could
just walk from one end
of town to the other

1048
00:50:46,209 --> 00:50:47,795
- <i>and just, you know... </i>
- Mmm.

1049
00:50:47,878 --> 00:50:51,465
- ...feel completely safe.
- ( fakes coughs ) Nipple.

1050
00:50:51,548 --> 00:50:53,467
- <i>( buzzer sounds ) </i>
- Shorty's heading out.

1051
00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:56,219
The spank bank has
once again been filled.
( chuckles )

1052
00:50:56,303 --> 00:50:58,472
I'll tell you
who was the hottest.

1053
00:50:58,555 --> 00:51:01,141
You're going to think
I'm crazy, but I'm
going to tell you.

1054
00:51:01,224 --> 00:51:04,019
Gina, man.
I can't get Gina
out of my head.

1055
00:51:04,102 --> 00:51:07,022
- Gonna think
of Gina all week.
- I think that--

1056
00:51:07,105 --> 00:51:09,107
( gears clicking )

1057
00:51:14,696 --> 00:51:16,364
- You know what's
a fun game?
- Huh?

1058
00:51:16,448 --> 00:51:18,283
You take three
Excedrin P.M.s

1059
00:51:18,366 --> 00:51:20,828
and you see
if you can whack off
before you fall asleep.

1060
00:51:20,911 --> 00:51:23,038
- ( sighs ) Oh.
- <i>( phone rings )</i>

1061
00:51:23,121 --> 00:51:25,666
You always win
is the best part
about the game.

1062
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:30,462
- Are you Andy?
- Yeah.

1063
00:51:30,545 --> 00:51:32,047
Is this yours?
Did you write this stuff?

1064
00:51:32,130 --> 00:51:34,508
My girlfriend Jill found
your speed dating card.

1065
00:51:34,591 --> 00:51:36,259
Oh, yeah, right.

1066
00:51:36,343 --> 00:51:38,428
God, I've been looking
for that speed dating card.

1067
00:51:38,512 --> 00:51:40,848
Thank you so much
for bringing it to me.

1068
00:51:40,931 --> 00:51:44,392
So you actually wrote that
one girl looked like she was
"hurting for a squirting"?

1069
00:51:44,476 --> 00:51:47,896
Mm-hmm. Yeah, "hurting
for a squirting."
I wrote that.

1070
00:51:47,980 --> 00:51:51,399
Oh, so you wrote,
"Ho for sho"?

1071
00:51:51,483 --> 00:51:54,028
Yeah, I remember that girl.
She was a ho...

1072
00:51:54,110 --> 00:51:55,696
for sho.

1073
00:51:55,779 --> 00:51:57,698
Let me show you
how this device works.

1074
00:51:57,781 --> 00:52:00,492
- I'm just looking
for a cordless phone.
- Yep, it's great.

1075
00:52:00,575 --> 00:52:02,494
You can do anything--
make a video diary.

1076
00:52:02,577 --> 00:52:04,496
It's like, "Hey, Amy,
how's it going?

1077
00:52:04,579 --> 00:52:06,456
How you feeling?
I'm great!

1078
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:09,167
I feel fantastic
since we broke up.

1079
00:52:09,250 --> 00:52:11,378
( shouts )
I feel <i>awesome!"</i>

1080
00:52:11,461 --> 00:52:14,464
Can you just show me
the department where
there would be phones?

1081
00:52:14,548 --> 00:52:16,466
"How have you been?
What's been going on?

1082
00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:18,719
I bet-- hey, have you
been doing a lot of this?"

1083
00:52:18,802 --> 00:52:21,847
- ( gags )
- Sir, please, sir.

1084
00:52:21,930 --> 00:52:25,225
You are never going to
meet anybody with that kind
of mentality about women,

1085
00:52:25,308 --> 00:52:28,353
- you sick son of a bitch!
- Who the fuck are you
to put <i>me </i>on trial?

1086
00:52:28,436 --> 00:52:31,648
I've never even met you.
So why don't you back
the shit off

1087
00:52:31,732 --> 00:52:34,234
and stop
with the inquisition?

1088
00:52:34,317 --> 00:52:36,028
- That's how you talk?
- You know what?

1089
00:52:36,111 --> 00:52:38,321
I don't have to
answer to you.
You ain't my bitch.

1090
00:52:38,405 --> 00:52:40,323
( imitates hood accent )
Know what I'm saying?

1091
00:52:40,407 --> 00:52:43,077
So shit, man.
Fuck it.

1092
00:52:43,159 --> 00:52:45,037
You shouldn't
even be hanging out
with this pervert.

1093
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:47,288
I don't hang out with him.
I work with him and that's it.

1094
00:52:47,372 --> 00:52:50,084
I tried to introduce
him to a few nice people,
he made a fool of himself.

1095
00:52:50,166 --> 00:52:51,835
I don't mess with him.
That's not me.

1096
00:52:51,919 --> 00:52:53,921
You should keep
your ho on a leash.

1097
00:52:54,004 --> 00:52:56,590
- Hold, bro,
I can't let you--
- Hey hey hey.

1098
00:52:56,673 --> 00:53:00,260
- I can't let you be talking
to my woman like that, dawg.
- Hey, bitch is running wild.

1099
00:53:00,343 --> 00:53:03,263
You miss that ass?
That's the ass
of a free man.

1100
00:53:03,346 --> 00:53:07,601
That ass is going out
tonight, maybe to a club,
maybe to a nightclub.

1101
00:53:07,684 --> 00:53:09,811
- Hey, Andy!
- David: <i>I'll give it</i>
<i> to her for free!</i>

1102
00:53:09,895 --> 00:53:11,813
- Take a look at your pal.
- Oh my God.

1103
00:53:11,897 --> 00:53:14,441
- Yeah, he's performing
a public colonoscopy.
- Shit.

1104
00:53:14,524 --> 00:53:17,318
Isn't that sweet?
I'm going to send David
home for the day,

1105
00:53:17,402 --> 00:53:19,988
- and you're going
to fill in for him.
- What? Selling things?

1106
00:53:20,072 --> 00:53:22,198
- You got that right.
- I don't think that's
a good idea.

1107
00:53:22,282 --> 00:53:24,242
You're going to
have to talk to people,

1108
00:53:24,325 --> 00:53:26,787
and I know that's
a frightening concept,
but I think you can handle it.

1109
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:28,371
So get out there
and start selling.

1110
00:53:28,455 --> 00:53:30,206
- I was making
a thing for Amy!
- Stop, man.

1111
00:53:30,290 --> 00:53:32,793
- Pull these-- ugh.
- Check it out.
I miss her.

1112
00:53:32,876 --> 00:53:35,420
( rock music playing )

1113
00:53:35,503 --> 00:53:37,589
Dude, the floor's
the ultimate aphrodisiac.

1114
00:53:37,672 --> 00:53:40,592
All you got to do is
go make your pick now.
Come on, man.

1115
00:53:40,675 --> 00:53:42,886
( whispers )
Okay.

1116
00:53:42,970 --> 00:53:47,599
- And you could act a little
enthused about it.
- Yeah.

1117
00:53:47,682 --> 00:53:51,812
Jay:
<i>That's right, that's right.</i>
<i>Gazelle in the pink top.</i>

1118
00:53:51,895 --> 00:53:54,064
- <i>Oh shit. </i>
- Oh, hey. It looks like

1119
00:53:54,148 --> 00:53:56,316
- <i>you're checking out</i>
<i> digital cameras. </i>
- You know what?

1120
00:53:56,399 --> 00:53:57,859
He ain't going
to do it willingly.

1121
00:53:57,943 --> 00:54:00,445
Now we need to facilitate
things a bit more.

1122
00:54:00,528 --> 00:54:02,280
- Yo, Andy.
- <i>Yeah.</i>

1123
00:54:02,363 --> 00:54:05,117
- Hey, what's up, dude?
This is Jay, man.
- Oh hey, Jay.

1124
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:08,787
I am throwing a party tonight.
It's going to be real mellow,
just chilled out.

1125
00:54:08,870 --> 00:54:12,248
Now you really need
to be there. It's going to
be really really colorful.

1126
00:54:12,332 --> 00:54:15,710
- Are you free?
- I think so.

1127
00:54:15,794 --> 00:54:17,712
<i>That was a joke, man.</i>
<i>I know you're free.</i>

1128
00:54:17,796 --> 00:54:19,339
- <i>( chuckles ) </i>
- I'm okay.

1129
00:54:19,422 --> 00:54:21,466
- <i>Got to go, man. </i>
- All right, bye.

1130
00:54:23,718 --> 00:54:25,762
So tell me, Montel.

1131
00:54:25,846 --> 00:54:29,183
Why weren't we invited
to the party?
What are we, Al Qaeda?

1132
00:54:29,265 --> 00:54:32,519
- No, hold up. It's not
that kind of party!
- No no no!

1133
00:54:32,602 --> 00:54:35,856
You're not coming to our
fucking party either,
okay? Fuck you!

1134
00:54:35,939 --> 00:54:38,108
- Yeah.
- First of all, it ain't
that kind of party.

1135
00:54:38,192 --> 00:54:40,318
- Go fuck a goat!
- Yeah!

1136
00:54:40,401 --> 00:54:43,197
- Why are you always telling me
to fuck a goat, man?!
- Mooj: <i>Fuck a goat!</i>

1137
00:54:43,279 --> 00:54:45,699
<i>( disco music playing )</i>

1138
00:54:45,782 --> 00:54:47,784
<i>( elevator dings )</i>

1139
00:54:49,285 --> 00:54:51,287
<i>( knocks )</i>

1140
00:54:59,671 --> 00:55:00,755
Hello?

1141
00:55:03,175 --> 00:55:04,759
Hello?

1142
00:55:04,843 --> 00:55:07,387
- <i>♪ I'm every woman... ♪ </i>
- Hello.

1143
00:55:07,470 --> 00:55:09,723
- Oh, hello.
- <i>♪ It's all in me... ♪</i>

1144
00:55:09,806 --> 00:55:12,893
Hi. Are you here
for Jay's party?

1145
00:55:12,976 --> 00:55:15,979
Yes. I am Jay's party.

1146
00:55:18,106 --> 00:55:21,026
Hiring a transvestite prostitute
isn't helping me, man!

1147
00:55:21,109 --> 00:55:23,570
What? Ain't nobody hiring
no damn transvestite!

1148
00:55:23,653 --> 00:55:26,240
She was really nice,
incidentally.

1149
00:55:26,322 --> 00:55:28,242
If that sister
was a transvestite,

1150
00:55:28,324 --> 00:55:30,077
that was the Mona Lisa
of transvestites.

1151
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:32,246
You got a hummer
from the tranny,
didn't you?

1152
00:55:32,328 --> 00:55:35,456
Aren't we owed one now?
'Cause technically we paid her.

1153
00:55:35,540 --> 00:55:38,710
- She had a dick, man!
- Do you guys even like me,

1154
00:55:38,793 --> 00:55:40,921
or is this
some sort of cruel joke

1155
00:55:41,004 --> 00:55:42,380
that you're all in on?

1156
00:55:42,463 --> 00:55:44,424
Because I'm not a freak!
I'm a good person.

1157
00:55:44,507 --> 00:55:47,677
I always thought
that Matt Damon
was a Streisand,

1158
00:55:47,761 --> 00:55:51,139
but I think that he's
rocking the shit in this one.

1159
00:55:51,223 --> 00:55:52,515
( shouts )
Shut up, Dave!

1160
00:55:52,599 --> 00:55:54,559
Hold up!
Hold up!

1161
00:55:54,642 --> 00:55:56,770
Let's just chill
on the aggression
for a minute.

1162
00:55:56,853 --> 00:55:58,438
- Beth: <i>Look at him. </i>
- <i>( woman laughs )</i>

1163
00:55:58,521 --> 00:56:01,649
He is such a bad-ass.

1164
00:56:01,733 --> 00:56:05,320
- He looks just like
Luke Wilson.
- Mm-hmm.

1165
00:56:05,403 --> 00:56:08,115
- So you're saying
she was definitely a man?
- Yes.

1166
00:56:08,198 --> 00:56:09,950
How do <i>you </i>know
that she was a man?

1167
00:56:10,033 --> 00:56:13,494
Because her hands were
as big as Andre the Giant's

1168
00:56:13,578 --> 00:56:16,456
and she had an Adam's apple
as big as her balls.

1169
00:56:16,539 --> 00:56:18,959
So you have no proof?

1170
00:56:19,042 --> 00:56:20,961
You know what?
Just leave me alone.

1171
00:56:21,044 --> 00:56:23,171
Just stay away from me
or I'm going to tell Paula

1172
00:56:23,255 --> 00:56:25,132
that you're all stealing
the recordable CDs.

1173
00:56:25,215 --> 00:56:27,717
- Whoa! Come on!
- Whoa whoa whoa!
Come on, man.

1174
00:56:27,801 --> 00:56:29,844
We did this
'cause we're you're friends,

1175
00:56:29,928 --> 00:56:32,347
and we didn't think
you had the balls
to do it yourself.

1176
00:56:32,430 --> 00:56:34,015
- Oh really?
- Dave: <i>Yeah.</i>

1177
00:56:34,099 --> 00:56:35,767
Okay, watch this.

1178
00:56:35,850 --> 00:56:37,769
Yo, Andy!
It's just CDs, man!

1179
00:56:37,852 --> 00:56:39,980
That's a third strike
for me, dawg!

1180
00:56:44,109 --> 00:56:47,695
- ( tires screech )
- <i>( man yells )</i>

1181
00:56:55,287 --> 00:56:57,289
( sighs deeply )

1182
00:57:00,125 --> 00:57:01,668
( bells jingle )

1183
00:57:03,419 --> 00:57:05,172
Hi.

1184
00:57:05,255 --> 00:57:08,133
- Andy, hi.
- Right. Yep.
You remember my name.

1185
00:57:08,216 --> 00:57:11,678
- I did. How you doing?
- I'm great.
I like your store.

1186
00:57:11,761 --> 00:57:14,014
That's good.
If you have time,
look around, it's--

1187
00:57:14,097 --> 00:57:17,058
Okay.
How's business been?

1188
00:57:17,142 --> 00:57:19,353
You know,
it's coming along.

1189
00:57:19,435 --> 00:57:22,147
- <i>It takes a while. </i>
- Do you want to go out
sometime?

1190
00:57:22,230 --> 00:57:25,192
Yes. Yes,
I would like that.

1191
00:57:25,275 --> 00:57:27,277
- Okay.
- <i>That'd be great.</i>
<i> I think</i>

1192
00:57:27,361 --> 00:57:29,321
I'm maybe free
this weekend if you, um--

1193
00:57:29,404 --> 00:57:31,489
if that's okay.
Or you could call
me tomorrow

1194
00:57:31,572 --> 00:57:33,367
- and we can just
firm it up.
- Okay.

1195
00:57:33,449 --> 00:57:35,952
- Both: Great.
- Okay, so I'll call you

1196
00:57:36,036 --> 00:57:38,038
and yeah, that'll be good.
That'll be good.

1197
00:57:38,121 --> 00:57:39,873
- How you doing?
- Congratulations.

1198
00:57:39,956 --> 00:57:42,250
Okay, so I'll-- yeah.

1199
00:57:42,334 --> 00:57:45,170
- Can I help you?
- Uh, yeah,
these are wonderful.

1200
00:57:45,253 --> 00:57:47,755
- I'll take these.
- Thanks, they are.

1201
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:49,883
They're great
and the goldfish
just crack me up.

1202
00:57:49,966 --> 00:57:51,509
- Funny.
- <i>( Trish laughs ) Yeah.</i>

1203
00:57:51,592 --> 00:57:53,220
Yeah, they are.
They're cute.

1204
00:57:53,303 --> 00:57:55,263
I actually don't sell
anything here.

1205
00:57:55,347 --> 00:57:56,723
I just sell them
on eBay.

1206
00:57:56,806 --> 00:57:58,599
Oh, I don't get it.

1207
00:57:58,683 --> 00:58:00,310
- I know.
- Okay.

1208
00:58:00,394 --> 00:58:03,021
- Can you help me?
- No, you're on your own here.

1209
00:58:03,104 --> 00:58:05,440
Good luck to you
and to you.

1210
00:58:05,523 --> 00:58:07,150
- I'll give you a call.
- Great.

1211
00:58:07,234 --> 00:58:09,903
- Great. Nice to see you.
- Thanks for coming in.

1212
00:58:09,986 --> 00:58:11,905
- Bye.
- <i>( bell jingles )</i>

1213
00:58:11,988 --> 00:58:13,907
So, I guess I'll
give you some money

1214
00:58:13,990 --> 00:58:15,742
and you can give me
these shoes.

1215
00:58:15,825 --> 00:58:18,912
You know, I know
it seems so strange.

1216
00:58:18,995 --> 00:58:21,664
Yeah, so I'd just
rather buy them from you,
straight up.

1217
00:58:21,748 --> 00:58:24,125
Yeah, I know.
I wish it could be
that easy, but--

1218
00:58:24,209 --> 00:58:27,128
I wish too, but you're
making it extremely
difficult for me.

1219
00:58:27,212 --> 00:58:30,548
I'm just trying to get
these shoes back to my house
so I can wear them.

1220
00:58:30,631 --> 00:58:33,801
- David: <i>I got a corpse</i>
<i> in my way. </i>
- Cal: <i>Just kill it.</i>

1221
00:58:33,885 --> 00:58:36,137
That's so not fair that
you have blades in your--

1222
00:58:36,221 --> 00:58:38,473
- Ha!
- I'm telling you, man.
I feel great.

1223
00:58:38,556 --> 00:58:41,142
I'm so-- it's like
a weight has been lifted.

1224
00:58:41,226 --> 00:58:43,895
Celibacy is
the way to go, man.
Andy had it right.

1225
00:58:43,978 --> 00:58:46,647
Look at him.
He looks younger
than all of us,

1226
00:58:46,731 --> 00:58:50,318
but he's 10 years older.
Why? It's because he's
never had a relationship.

1227
00:58:50,402 --> 00:58:53,571
No she-devil <i>sucked </i>
his life force out yet.

1228
00:58:53,654 --> 00:58:55,656
( phone beeping )

1229
00:59:03,957 --> 00:59:05,959
<i>( phone ringing )</i>

1230
00:59:09,296 --> 00:59:12,173
- Hello?
- Hey hey, hi, hello.

1231
00:59:12,257 --> 00:59:15,343
- Um, is this Trish?
- Who's calling, please?

1232
00:59:15,427 --> 00:59:18,138
- This is Andy.
- Oh, hi, Andy!

1233
00:59:18,221 --> 00:59:20,432
- <i>Hi, how are you doing? </i>
- I'm good, how are you doing?

1234
00:59:20,515 --> 00:59:22,016
I'm doing great,
I'm doing great.

1235
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:24,852
- So you're gay now?
- No, I'm not gay,

1236
00:59:24,936 --> 00:59:26,604
I'm just celibate.

1237
00:59:26,687 --> 00:59:28,689
I think--
I mean that sounds g--

1238
00:59:28,773 --> 00:59:31,859
I just want you
to know that this is
the first conversation

1239
00:59:31,943 --> 00:59:35,029
of three conversations
that leads to you being gay.

1240
00:59:35,113 --> 00:59:37,157
There's this,
and then in a year

1241
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:39,951
it's like, "Oh, you know,
I kinda want to get
back out there,

1242
00:59:40,034 --> 00:59:41,786
but I think I like guys."

1243
00:59:41,869 --> 00:59:44,372
And then there's the big,
"Oh, I'm a gay guy now."

1244
00:59:44,456 --> 00:59:47,375
- You're gay
for saying that.
- I'm gay for saying that?

1245
00:59:47,459 --> 00:59:49,836
- You know how
I know you're gay?
- <i>How do you know I'm gay?</i>

1246
00:59:49,919 --> 00:59:52,588
'Cause you macraméd yourself
a pair of jean shorts.

1247
00:59:52,672 --> 00:59:55,591
Know how I know you're gay?
You just told me you're not
sleeping with women anymore.

1248
00:59:55,675 --> 00:59:58,261
- You know how
I know you're gay?
- How, 'cause you're gay

1249
00:59:58,345 --> 01:00:00,514
and you can tell
who other gay people are?

1250
01:00:00,596 --> 01:00:02,474
- You know how
I know you're gay?
- <i>How?</i>

1251
01:00:02,557 --> 01:00:04,600
You like Coldplay.

1252
01:00:04,684 --> 01:00:08,271
- Oh, you're dead.
You're dead. Oh!
- Oh! Come on.

1253
01:00:08,355 --> 01:00:10,273
Leave my torso alone
at least.

1254
01:00:10,357 --> 01:00:12,484
I also wanted
to call and--

1255
01:00:12,567 --> 01:00:15,111
and see what night
you might want to go out.

1256
01:00:15,195 --> 01:00:17,780
I'm actually free tonight.

1257
01:00:17,864 --> 01:00:19,782
Well, oh-- okay.

1258
01:00:19,866 --> 01:00:22,327
Well, I was thinking
maybe this weekend,
but that's good.

1259
01:00:22,410 --> 01:00:25,746
- Okay.
- Oh, great. What time do
you want to pick me up?

1260
01:00:25,830 --> 01:00:27,623
Uh...

1261
01:00:27,707 --> 01:00:30,877
let's see.
That's actually
kind of a problem,

1262
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:33,588
because I ride a bike.

1263
01:00:33,671 --> 01:00:35,756
<i>That's cool,</i>
<i>are you kidding me?</i>

1264
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:38,510
I love getting on
the back of a motorcycle.
My boyfriend in college

1265
01:00:38,593 --> 01:00:40,803
- <i>drove a motorcycle so... </i>
- Yeah. Yeah.

1266
01:00:40,887 --> 01:00:42,930
- <i>...I'm cool. </i>
- Yeah, I bet
that was cool.

1267
01:00:43,014 --> 01:00:46,351
- I ride a bike-- bikes--
bike-cycle-- bicycle.
- <i>Oh.</i>

1268
01:00:46,434 --> 01:00:48,769
You know how I know
that you're gay?

1269
01:00:48,853 --> 01:00:51,398
- How?
- You like the movie
"Maid in Manhattan."

1270
01:00:51,481 --> 01:00:53,691
- You know how
I know you're gay?
- How?

1271
01:00:53,774 --> 01:00:56,277
I saw you make
spinach dip in a loaf
of sourdough bread once.

1272
01:00:56,361 --> 01:00:58,654
- You know I know
that you're gay?
- How?

1273
01:00:58,738 --> 01:01:00,823
You have a rainbow
bumper sticker on your car

1274
01:01:00,907 --> 01:01:04,494
- that says "I love it
when balls are in my face."
- That's gay?

1275
01:01:04,578 --> 01:01:07,830
- God damn it!
- I'm ripping your
head off right now.

1276
01:01:07,914 --> 01:01:09,832
It's off,

1277
01:01:09,916 --> 01:01:11,959
and now I'm throwing
it at your body.

1278
01:01:12,043 --> 01:01:15,255
- ( game character grunts )
- Fuck you!

1279
01:01:15,338 --> 01:01:17,131
You guys...

1280
01:01:17,215 --> 01:01:19,133
she's picking me
up in an hour.

1281
01:01:20,260 --> 01:01:22,262
Oh, drag, dude.

1282
01:01:22,345 --> 01:01:23,804
Wait, she's--
picking you up from <i>here?</i>

1283
01:01:23,888 --> 01:01:25,806
- Yeah.
- That's fucked up, man.

1284
01:01:25,890 --> 01:01:29,436
- Why?
- Why?! Seriously!

1285
01:01:30,645 --> 01:01:32,606
I mean, look at
this place, man.

1286
01:01:32,688 --> 01:01:35,733
You-- you gotta see this
through the <i>eyes </i>of a woman.

1287
01:01:35,816 --> 01:01:38,570
What is she gonna think
when she comes in here?

1288
01:01:38,653 --> 01:01:40,572
- "Look, he's got
a billion toys."
- So what?

1289
01:01:40,655 --> 01:01:43,032
And more video games
than a teenaged Asian kid.

1290
01:01:43,116 --> 01:01:45,118
Well, s-- all right.

1291
01:01:45,201 --> 01:01:48,871
Is that the Six Million
Dollar Man's <i>boss?</i>

1292
01:01:48,955 --> 01:01:50,915
- It's Oscar Goldman.
- Why do you have that?

1293
01:01:50,998 --> 01:01:53,251
That's worth a lot of money.

1294
01:01:53,334 --> 01:01:56,129
- That's much more valuable
than Steve Austin.
- That may be the case,

1295
01:01:56,212 --> 01:01:58,756
but none of this shit
is <i>sexy, </i>okay?

1296
01:01:58,839 --> 01:02:00,383
I'm not trying
to be sexy, man!

1297
01:02:00,467 --> 01:02:04,095
I mean-- Asia?
You <i>framed </i>an Asia poster?

1298
01:02:04,178 --> 01:02:07,181
How hard did the people
at the frame store laugh
when you brought this in?

1299
01:02:07,265 --> 01:02:10,768
- They did not laugh at me!
- Know why you're gay?
'Cause you like Asia.

1300
01:02:10,851 --> 01:02:13,313
Cool it with the gay!
She's on her way
over here, okay?

1301
01:02:13,396 --> 01:02:15,982
First you relax, okay?

1302
01:02:16,065 --> 01:02:18,901
Just stop calming me down
and tell me what I should do.

1303
01:02:18,985 --> 01:02:22,196
We take everything
that's embarrassing,
and we move it out of here

1304
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:24,699
so it doesn't look like
you live in Neverland Ranch.

1305
01:02:30,413 --> 01:02:32,790
- Hi.
- Hi, how are you?

1306
01:02:32,873 --> 01:02:35,876
- Good.
- So, you want to head out?

1307
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:37,753
Did you just
move in or something?

1308
01:02:37,837 --> 01:02:39,839
Oh, no. No, actually,
I'm getting new carpet in--

1309
01:02:39,922 --> 01:02:41,924
I'm having carpet
put in tomorrow.

1310
01:02:42,008 --> 01:02:44,051
- Oh.
- So...

1311
01:02:44,135 --> 01:02:46,304
- Oh, well.
- Yep, okay.

1312
01:02:46,387 --> 01:02:49,223
- It looks good
with the floors. All right.
- Yeah.

1313
01:02:49,307 --> 01:02:52,977
I should tear up
the hardwood and see if
there's carpet underneath.

1314
01:02:53,060 --> 01:02:55,188
- ( laughing )
- That's never the case.

1315
01:02:57,273 --> 01:02:59,734
- This is gonna be fun.
- <i>( women singing</i>
<i> in Japanese )</i>

1316
01:02:59,817 --> 01:03:03,196
- Yes, this is.
- I drive by this place
every day, I've never been in.

1317
01:03:03,279 --> 01:03:05,948
I'm glad you came.

1318
01:03:06,032 --> 01:03:09,202
I never really go out
with nice guys like you.

1319
01:03:09,285 --> 01:03:12,413
I think I've <i>avoided </i>
nice guys like you
my whole life

1320
01:03:12,497 --> 01:03:15,124
at my own peril.
( laughs )

1321
01:03:15,208 --> 01:03:17,585
My last boyfriend
drank a lot.

1322
01:03:17,669 --> 01:03:19,337
- Mm-hmm.
- And so--

1323
01:03:19,420 --> 01:03:21,339
This is just punch.

1324
01:03:21,422 --> 01:03:23,758
- It's okay,
a little bit's fine.
- Buddha punch.

1325
01:03:23,841 --> 01:03:25,760
I need some Buddha.

1326
01:03:25,843 --> 01:03:27,845
- ( laughing )
- Man: <i>Excuse me, Miss!</i>

1327
01:03:27,928 --> 01:03:31,182
Could you gather your team
and sing "Happy Birthday"
for my daughter please?

Yay!

1330
01:03:49,701 --> 01:03:52,746
- That was so good. What?
- That was great,
happy birthday.

1331
01:03:52,828 --> 01:03:54,872
- It's your birthday, too?
- No.

1332
01:03:54,955 --> 01:03:57,083
- Hey, it's his birthday too!
- No no no.

1333
01:03:57,166 --> 01:03:59,377
Could you sing for him
and bring him a cake?

1334
01:03:59,460 --> 01:04:01,462
Man:
Happy birthday!

Thank you.

- Happy birthday, Andy.

Wow.

You--

1341
01:04:33,745 --> 01:04:36,623
You really like
kissing, don't you?

1342
01:04:36,706 --> 01:04:39,459
- Yes!
- ( laughing )

1343

- I really do-- what?
- Take off your-- take off

Oh, okay.

1345
01:04:45,047 --> 01:04:46,006
Okay?

1346
01:04:48,593 --> 01:04:50,720
- Wow, this is
really gonna happen.
- Oh, yeah.

1347
01:04:50,804 --> 01:04:53,514
Thank God.

1348
01:04:53,598 --> 01:04:56,225
Okay. I'm taking
off my pants.

1349
01:04:56,309 --> 01:04:58,936
Yeah. Do you
need some help?

1350

I think almost got 'em.
It's hooked on my ankle.

Wow, that's--

1352
01:05:05,318 --> 01:05:07,528
Hey, wait, do you
have protection?

1353
01:05:07,612 --> 01:05:09,530
I don't like guns.

I have condoms

date because they were
from when I was married.

1359
01:05:21,959 --> 01:05:24,754
We didn't have sex
that often, that's why
there are so many, okay?

1360
01:05:24,838 --> 01:05:26,631
Okay.

I'm not! That is so unfair!
- I'm gonna head out.

No, I haven't
heard that term.

- Can you imagine that?
- I don't want to, no.

a lot of male attention.

Guatemalan gardener, Javier.

- Okay.
- You know, Javier...

1415
01:08:26,686 --> 01:08:30,481

passionate yet gentle

the first time...

1417

Guatemalan love song.

How was the date

- It was a disaster.
- Really?

Yes, I've never been more
embarrassed in my life.

the condoms to work,

one of them
exploded on my balls

walked in the room.

- Wait, hold up. She was hiding
the kid from you, dawg?
- You know what?

01:09:48,017 --> 01:09:50,811
It doesn't matter, because
it was going downhill
straight from there.

1438
01:09:50,895 --> 01:09:52,813
Listen, you don't want
no baby-daddy drama.

1439
01:09:52,897 --> 01:09:54,523
Trust me on
this one, a'ight?

1440
01:09:54,607 --> 01:09:56,734
For all you know,
he in prison right now.

1441
01:09:56,817 --> 01:09:59,028
<i>Let's say</i>
<i>y'all living together,</i>
<i>next thing you know,</i>

1442
01:09:59,112 --> 01:10:02,489
you the one going on the
1st and the 15th to pick
up the government check.

1443
01:10:02,573 --> 01:10:05,325
What if he got boys
that's on the outside
and they stalking you?

1444
01:10:05,409 --> 01:10:07,536
You see what I'm saying?
You got to think, partner--

1445
01:10:07,620 --> 01:10:09,371
What the fuck are
you talking about?

1446
01:10:09,455 --> 01:10:11,999
Here's what you do.
You <i>tell </i>her you're a virgin.

1447
01:10:12,083 --> 01:10:14,251
You <i>test </i>her
with this shit, okay?

1448
01:10:14,334 --> 01:10:16,837
Tell me, this is how
it's gonna go. Tell me.

1449
01:10:16,921 --> 01:10:19,506
- I'm a virgin.
- Sweet!

1450
01:10:19,590 --> 01:10:21,508
I like that

1451
01:10:21,592 --> 01:10:24,261
because you don't
have Chlamydia.

1452
01:10:24,344 --> 01:10:27,014
And I know that.
And that shit is everywhere.

1453
01:10:27,098 --> 01:10:29,224
What if she laughs
at me, though?

1454
01:10:29,308 --> 01:10:31,518
Then you punch her
in the fucking head
if she laughs.

1455
01:10:31,602 --> 01:10:34,063
I'm not gonna
punch her in the head,
she's really sweet.

1456
01:10:34,147 --> 01:10:37,691
No, I mean, you punch her
in the head <i>emotionally.</i>

1457
01:10:37,775 --> 01:10:39,443
She's different,

1458
01:10:39,526 --> 01:10:42,029
she's someone I felt like
I had a connection with.

1459
01:10:42,113 --> 01:10:45,783
All you trying
to do right now is
bust off this first nut.

1460
01:10:45,866 --> 01:10:49,453
- <i>You got a whole lot</i>
<i> of semen back up in you. </i>
- I am going to tell her.

1461
01:10:49,536 --> 01:10:51,747
- You should
totally tell her.
- I'm going to.

1462
01:10:51,831 --> 01:10:54,333
'Cause I watched this
movie called "Liar, Liar,"

1463
01:10:54,416 --> 01:10:56,418
and the message
was <i>"Don't </i>lie."

1464
01:10:56,502 --> 01:10:59,630
- And that was a smart movie.
- Yeah, that's the right thing.

1465
01:10:59,713 --> 01:11:01,465
Really?

1466
01:11:01,548 --> 01:11:05,178
All your girlfriends
wanted to have sex
with virgins too?

1467
01:11:05,260 --> 01:11:08,889
That's funny,
I didn't even know you--
girls talked like that.

1468
01:11:08,973 --> 01:11:12,893
<i>I think</i>
<i>my first time might be</i>
<i>your best time, too.</i>

1469
01:11:12,977 --> 01:11:14,728
Well, I knew it.
You know what?

1470
01:11:14,812 --> 01:11:16,605
I knew that
you'd react that way

1471
01:11:16,689 --> 01:11:19,316
and I knew that you would
want to lead me

1472
01:11:19,399 --> 01:11:22,486
through my first
sexual encounter

1473
01:11:22,569 --> 01:11:25,865
with all the compassion
and care

1474
01:11:25,948 --> 01:11:29,243
that someone would give
to their soulmate.

1475
01:11:29,326 --> 01:11:30,953
Oh my God,
I am in trouble.

1476
01:11:31,037 --> 01:11:32,872
<i>( crickets chirping )</i>

1477
01:11:33,998 --> 01:11:36,000
Hey, Andy!

1478
01:11:36,083 --> 01:11:38,085
- <i>You watching</i>
<i> "Survivor" tonight? </i>
- Oh, no.

1479
01:11:38,169 --> 01:11:40,129
- Actually, I'm going out
to dinner with somebody.
- <i>Oh.</i>

1480
01:11:40,213 --> 01:11:42,631
- Hi.
- Oh, and this is her.

1481
01:11:42,715 --> 01:11:45,092
- Um, Trish, this is
Joe and Sara.
- Hi.

1482
01:11:45,176 --> 01:11:46,760
- Hi, Trish.
- Hey.

1483
01:11:46,844 --> 01:11:48,554
- Tape it for me, okay?
- Will do.

1484
01:11:48,637 --> 01:11:50,514
- Thanks, all right.
- So long.

1485
01:11:50,597 --> 01:11:52,474
- See you later.
Have a good night.
- Sara: Bye-bye.

1486
01:11:52,558 --> 01:11:55,269
Yeah, my man's gonna
get it on tonight!
Yes, sir!

1487
01:11:55,352 --> 01:11:59,065
Mm-hmm, and you better
get on me, too. Mm-hmm.

1488
01:11:59,148 --> 01:12:02,276
What is wrong
with this woman?
Mercy mercy mercy.

1489
01:12:02,359 --> 01:12:05,279
<i>( jazz music playing )</i>

1490
01:12:06,572 --> 01:12:08,699
Thanks.

1491
01:12:08,782 --> 01:12:11,160
- I'm so sorry that happened
the other night.
- No, I'm sorry.

1492
01:12:11,244 --> 01:12:13,120
- Oh my God.
- I'm sorry.
That was me.

1493
01:12:13,204 --> 01:12:15,122
No. What?
( laughs )

1494
01:12:15,206 --> 01:12:17,833
Let me--
I have something
I wanna tell you.

1495
01:12:17,917 --> 01:12:19,960
Kinda hard
to talk about.

1496
01:12:21,754 --> 01:12:24,339
But there-- you know,

1497
01:12:24,423 --> 01:12:26,341
there's certain--
certain things

1498
01:12:26,425 --> 01:12:29,220
about who I am
that, um--

1499
01:12:29,303 --> 01:12:32,681
I'm sorry, I have to--
I just have to get this
off my chest.

1500
01:12:32,765 --> 01:12:35,350
I am so sorry
I didn't tell you
I had kids.

1501
01:12:35,434 --> 01:12:37,352
Yeah, what was
that about?

1502
01:12:37,436 --> 01:12:40,231
Gosh, you know,
that really surprised me.

1503
01:12:41,356 --> 01:12:43,192
( both laughing )

1504
01:12:43,276 --> 01:12:45,444
- Sorry.
- No. You should have
told me, probably...

1505
01:12:45,527 --> 01:12:48,655
- I know!
- ...but what do I care
if you have a kid?

1506
01:12:48,739 --> 01:12:50,449
Well, I have two kids.

1507
01:12:50,532 --> 01:12:52,659
Uh, wow! Okay.

1508
01:12:52,743 --> 01:12:55,288
- How old are they?
- Uh, six...

1509
01:12:56,455 --> 01:12:57,831
16.

1510
01:12:57,915 --> 01:13:00,209
21.

1511
01:13:00,293 --> 01:13:02,377
- 42.
- ( laughs )

1512
01:13:02,461 --> 01:13:04,713
56-- How many kids
do you have?

1513
01:13:04,797 --> 01:13:06,423
- I have three.
- Okay, three.

1514
01:13:06,506 --> 01:13:08,884
- Yeah. Oh, and one
of them has a kid.
- Oh.

1515
01:13:08,968 --> 01:13:11,428
- A one-year-old.
- That's cool
That's great.

1516
01:13:13,013 --> 01:13:15,641
I'm really glad
we're doing this.

1517
01:13:16,809 --> 01:13:18,060
Me too.

1518
01:13:18,144 --> 01:13:20,104
Um...

1519
01:13:21,772 --> 01:13:24,858
Listen, Andy,
I don't want to send you

1520
01:13:24,942 --> 01:13:26,777
running for the hills
or anything,

1521
01:13:26,860 --> 01:13:30,697
but I really feel
like if we decide
to do this again

1522
01:13:30,781 --> 01:13:33,242
then, um...

1523
01:13:33,326 --> 01:13:37,204
maybe we should hold off
on the physical part
for a while.

1524
01:13:39,039 --> 01:13:41,334
That is a fantastic idea.

1525
01:13:41,416 --> 01:13:43,210
Why didn't I think
of that?

1526
01:13:43,294 --> 01:13:44,962
- Really?
- <i>Totally.</i>

1527
01:13:45,045 --> 01:13:46,630
- No sex?
- No!

1528
01:13:46,713 --> 01:13:49,591
Why do that?!
Because-- here's the thing--

1529
01:13:49,675 --> 01:13:51,677
from personal experience
I found

1530
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:54,096
that sex can really
complicate things,

1531
01:13:54,180 --> 01:13:57,183
<i>and what we should be</i>
<i>doing right now is just</i>
<i>getting to know each other.</i>

1532
01:13:57,266 --> 01:13:58,809
Yeah!
( laughs )

1533
01:13:58,892 --> 01:14:00,811
I never thought
you'd go for it.

1534
01:14:00,894 --> 01:14:02,188
<i>I'm going for it.</i>

1535
01:14:02,271 --> 01:14:05,191
That just is
a great great notion.

1536
01:14:05,274 --> 01:14:07,067
- ( laughs )
- Are you serious?

1537
01:14:07,151 --> 01:14:09,903
Look at my face.
Look at how serious I am.

1538
01:14:09,987 --> 01:14:11,780
Can you see my nostrils?

1539
01:14:11,864 --> 01:14:13,573
- ( laughs ) Yes.
- That's serious.

1540
01:14:13,657 --> 01:14:15,742
Well, that's more angry--
( laughs )

1541
01:14:15,826 --> 01:14:17,870
Yeah. You know what?
Most guys would be

1542
01:14:17,953 --> 01:14:19,705
saying "Yeah,"
right now,

1543
01:14:19,788 --> 01:14:21,332
but, like,
by the third date
it'd be,

1544
01:14:21,415 --> 01:14:24,584
"Hey, baby, I really need
to physically express

1545
01:14:24,668 --> 01:14:26,586
how I feel,"
all that stuff.
( laughing )

1546
01:14:26,670 --> 01:14:29,048
Well, hey, baby,
you know, three dates?

1547
01:14:29,131 --> 01:14:30,966
Make it 10.
10 dates.

1548
01:14:32,051 --> 01:14:33,677
How about 15?

1549
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:35,679
- 15?!
- ( laughing )

1550
01:14:35,762 --> 01:14:38,098
Screw your 15!
20 dates!

1551
01:14:38,182 --> 01:14:40,475
- Okay, 20 dates.
- 20 dates.

1552
01:14:40,559 --> 01:14:42,769
- Okay.
- This is <i>genius.</i>

1553
01:14:42,853 --> 01:14:44,855
It's gonna hurt.
( laughing )

1554
01:14:46,857 --> 01:14:49,276
Not as much
as you think.

1555
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:52,446
- ( moaning )
- We can really get to know
each other this way.

1556
01:14:52,529 --> 01:14:55,032
Yeah.
This is one, right?

1557
01:14:55,115 --> 01:14:57,201
Uh-huh--
no, next one.

1558
01:14:58,493 --> 01:15:01,121
<i>( door opens )</i>

1559
01:15:01,205 --> 01:15:04,458
Ahem.
Is it safe to come in,
or are you guys doing it?

1560
01:15:04,541 --> 01:15:07,044
- Honey, it's safe.
- Ahem.

1561
01:15:07,127 --> 01:15:08,837
Great.

1562
01:15:08,921 --> 01:15:12,132
- Well, good timing.
( chuckles )
- <i>Yeah.</i>

1563
01:15:12,216 --> 01:15:14,176
- <i>You remember Marla. </i>
- Hi, we met.

1564
01:15:14,260 --> 01:15:17,137
And this is my little
bunny rabbit Julia.

1565
01:15:17,221 --> 01:15:18,638
- Hey.
- This is Andy.

1566
01:15:18,722 --> 01:15:21,975
Julia, how're you doing?
You know what?

1567
01:15:22,059 --> 01:15:25,187
Do you by any chance
like magic?

1568
01:15:25,271 --> 01:15:27,773
- Yeah.
- I thought
that you might...

1569
01:15:27,856 --> 01:15:29,566
- ( Trish chuckling )
- because I noticed
on the way in

1570
01:15:29,649 --> 01:15:31,818
that you had
something shiny
behind your ear.

1571
01:15:31,902 --> 01:15:34,321
Marla, did you see that?
Something behind her ear?

1572
01:15:34,405 --> 01:15:35,822
I think you do.
Can I check?

1573
01:15:35,906 --> 01:15:37,657
Do you mind if I check
behind your ear?

1574
01:15:37,741 --> 01:15:39,659
( pops lips, yells )
Big money!

1575
01:15:39,743 --> 01:15:41,578
- Whoa!
- ( Trish laughing )

1576
01:15:41,661 --> 01:15:43,956
- That's amazing!
- Wow, it is amazing!

1577
01:15:44,039 --> 01:15:46,292
There's something else, too,
behind your ear, I think.

1578
01:15:46,375 --> 01:15:48,585
No, actually it's not
behind your ear.
It <i>is </i>your ear.

1579
01:15:48,668 --> 01:15:51,004
( yells )
Crrrip! It is your ear.

1580
01:15:51,088 --> 01:15:53,507
- ( Trish laughing )
- There is your ear!

1581
01:15:53,590 --> 01:15:55,259
I ripped it off.

1582
01:15:55,342 --> 01:15:57,010
- Gross!
- Yeah, that's sick.
( laughing )

1583
01:15:57,094 --> 01:15:59,096
All right, wait,
okay, but that means

1584
01:15:59,179 --> 01:16:02,641
that you walk around
with a rubber ear in your
pocket all day?

1585
01:16:02,724 --> 01:16:05,185
Um, yeah, like,
half the time.

1586
01:16:05,269 --> 01:16:07,396
You know, I can come
to your high school

1587
01:16:07,480 --> 01:16:09,482
and do it for
your friends if you want.

1588
01:16:09,564 --> 01:16:11,566
You know what?
I should head out.

1589
01:16:11,650 --> 01:16:12,901
- Oh really?
- Yeah.

1590
01:16:12,985 --> 01:16:14,736
Oh, well, I have
to give you a ride home.

1591
01:16:14,820 --> 01:16:17,323
- Right, yes, you do.
- Right.

1592
01:16:17,406 --> 01:16:20,117
- Yeah, 'cause you
don't have a car, right?
- Right, I don't have a car.

1593
01:16:20,200 --> 01:16:23,329
That's good,
'cause he doesn't have
a car and he does magic.

1594
01:16:23,412 --> 01:16:25,247
Awesome. Wow.

1595
01:16:25,331 --> 01:16:27,333
And sarcasm is like
a second language to me,

1596
01:16:27,416 --> 01:16:29,876
so I'm right there
with you.

1597
01:16:29,960 --> 01:16:31,878
<i>( both giggling )</i>

1598
01:16:31,962 --> 01:16:34,173
- <i>( jazz music playing ) </i>
- ( phone rings )

1599
01:16:34,256 --> 01:16:35,632
Yello!

1600
01:16:35,715 --> 01:16:38,093
- Hey hey hey, Cal.
- <i>Hey!</i>

1601
01:16:38,177 --> 01:16:39,719
I just got back
from the date.

1602
01:16:39,803 --> 01:16:41,430
<i>Did you tell her</i>
<i>you're a virgin?</i>

1603
01:16:41,514 --> 01:16:44,266
Uh, no.
I haven't gotten
to that yet.

1604
01:16:44,350 --> 01:16:46,601
Really?
Are you having sex
right now?

1605
01:16:46,685 --> 01:16:49,396
<i>No! She was incredible.</i>

1606
01:16:49,480 --> 01:16:51,648
She was amazing.
She didn't pressure me.

1607
01:16:51,731 --> 01:16:55,319
Hey, oh, and-- and--
and she has three kids!

1608
01:16:55,402 --> 01:16:58,489
<i>And one of her kids</i>
<i>has a kid.</i>

1609
01:16:58,572 --> 01:17:00,240
You all right?

1610
01:17:00,324 --> 01:17:03,118
Did you just say that
she has three kids,

1611
01:17:03,202 --> 01:17:04,911
one of whom has a kid?

1612
01:17:04,995 --> 01:17:07,706
- Yeah!
- <i>So she's a grandma?</i>

1613
01:17:07,789 --> 01:17:10,959
- No.
- <i>I'm not a doctor</i>
<i> or anything like that,</i>

1614
01:17:11,043 --> 01:17:13,379
but she's
a fucking grandma.
( laughing )

1615
01:17:13,462 --> 01:17:15,422
Yeah, well, whatever,
you know.

1616
01:17:15,506 --> 01:17:17,716
- She's the hottest
grandma I ever saw.
- Yeah, she is.

1617
01:17:17,799 --> 01:17:19,009
- <i>She's a hot grandma. </i>
- That's a good-looking
grandma.

1618
01:17:19,092 --> 01:17:21,345
My grandma looks
like Jack Palance.

1619
01:17:21,428 --> 01:17:23,347
- <i>Well, she's</i>
<i> no Jack Palance. </i>
- No, if Jack Palance looked

1620
01:17:23,430 --> 01:17:26,183
like that lady,
I would want to fuck
Jack Palance right now.

1621
01:17:26,266 --> 01:17:28,852
( laughs )
Yeah, me too.
She's a hot grandma.

1622
01:17:28,935 --> 01:17:30,687
<i>Hey, yeah.</i>
<i>No, do a grandma, man.</i>

1623
01:17:30,770 --> 01:17:34,149
You should fuck her on her
plastic-covered couch.

1624
01:17:34,233 --> 01:17:37,110
Fuck her while she watches
"Murder She Wrote."
She would probably

1625
01:17:37,194 --> 01:17:39,488
- find that very erotic.
- Yeah, well, whatever,
you know.

1626
01:17:39,572 --> 01:17:42,824
Fuck her and then
have her send you a check
for $12 on your birthday.

1627
01:17:42,908 --> 01:17:44,577
I'm the dude
with the hot granny!

1628
01:17:44,659 --> 01:17:46,453
- <i>Do her. </i>
- ( laughs )

1629
01:17:46,537 --> 01:17:48,830
Andy:
<i>What did you want</i>
<i>to talk to me about?</i>

1630
01:17:48,914 --> 01:17:50,832
Well, Andy, the numbers
just came in,

1631
01:17:50,916 --> 01:17:54,587
and you are by far
our best salesman.

1632
01:17:54,669 --> 01:17:57,464
- Cool.
- So I am promoting you
to floor manager.

1633
01:17:57,548 --> 01:17:59,425
This is the bullshit
of all bullshits,

1634
01:17:59,508 --> 01:18:01,510
you scumbag ass kisser!

1635
01:18:03,554 --> 01:18:05,138
Thank you.
That's great.

1636
01:18:05,222 --> 01:18:07,433
I understand
you have a girlfriend.

1637
01:18:07,516 --> 01:18:09,976
Yeah, I'm kinda
seeing somebody.

1638
01:18:10,060 --> 01:18:12,605
- I'm very happy for you.
- Thanks. She's great.

1639
01:18:12,687 --> 01:18:16,233
- Are you still a virgin?
- Oh, you know...

1640
01:18:16,316 --> 01:18:19,027
- I don't really talk
about my personal life--
- You're a virgin.

1641
01:18:19,111 --> 01:18:21,572
- Yes, I am.
- Yeah.

1642
01:18:21,655 --> 01:18:23,740
My door is always open...

1643
01:18:23,823 --> 01:18:26,368
- so to speak.
- Great.

1644
01:18:27,494 --> 01:18:28,954
Great.
Thank you.

1645
01:18:29,037 --> 01:18:31,706
I'm very discreet...

1646
01:18:34,209 --> 01:18:37,170
but I'll haunt
your dreams.

1647
01:18:37,254 --> 01:18:40,090
- Okay.
- Okay.

1648
01:18:40,173 --> 01:18:42,175
( inhales deeply )

1649
01:18:44,803 --> 01:18:46,888
( quietly )
Wow.

1650
01:18:48,098 --> 01:18:50,225
So who's gonna take
my job?

1651
01:18:50,309 --> 01:18:52,603
Cal will be
taking over your job,

1652
01:18:52,686 --> 01:18:55,689
and he's interviewing
people right now
for his old job.

1653
01:18:55,772 --> 01:18:57,732
So, have you ever worked
with electronics before?

1654
01:18:57,816 --> 01:18:59,025
- No.
- No.

1655
01:18:59,109 --> 01:19:02,362
But I have electronics
in my home.

1656
01:19:02,446 --> 01:19:04,364
Perfect!

1657
01:19:04,448 --> 01:19:07,409
That's the job, pretty much.
You're very well qualified.

1658
01:19:07,493 --> 01:19:11,121
- More than
these other losers.
- ( both giggle )

1659
01:19:11,204 --> 01:19:14,333
- I could do that--
- Wait wait wait wait,
last thing, last thing.

1660
01:19:14,416 --> 01:19:16,543
I'm also gonna need
that extended warranty on it

1661
01:19:16,627 --> 01:19:19,463
for the price of...
on the house, hmm?

1662
01:19:19,546 --> 01:19:21,590
That I can't do.

1663
01:19:21,674 --> 01:19:24,301
Hey, don't be a Negro,
be my nigga, all right?
Help me out.

1664
01:19:24,384 --> 01:19:26,428
Wait, hold on, hold on.
I ain't nobody's nigga.

1665
01:19:26,512 --> 01:19:30,098
Well, I mean,
you're somebody's nigga,
wearing this nigga tie.

1666
01:19:30,182 --> 01:19:32,476
- Now you're being
condescending, see?
- Mm-hmm.

1667
01:19:32,559 --> 01:19:36,021
You've been warned, a'ight?
Let's move forward amicably.

1668
01:19:36,104 --> 01:19:39,566
Okay, check this out, though.
First of all, you're throwing
too many big words at me, okay?

1669
01:19:39,650 --> 01:19:42,569
Now, because I don't
understand them, I'm gonna
take 'em as disrespect.

1670
01:19:42,653 --> 01:19:44,655
- Mmm.
- Watch your mouth
and help me with the sale.

1671
01:19:44,738 --> 01:19:47,574
Okay, see--
see, now you found
yourself a nigga.

1672
01:19:47,658 --> 01:19:49,784
- You were lookin' for
a nigga? Nigga here now.
- Okay.

1673
01:19:49,868 --> 01:19:52,579
Today's forecast--
dark and cloudy,

1674
01:19:52,663 --> 01:19:54,080
and chance of drive-by.

1675
01:19:54,164 --> 01:19:57,125
Jay, what's going on?

1676
01:19:57,209 --> 01:20:00,754
( sobbing )
Jill broke up with me.

1677
01:20:00,837 --> 01:20:03,131
Oh, I'm so sorry.
What happened?

1678
01:20:03,215 --> 01:20:05,133
I came home
a little tipsy,

1679
01:20:05,217 --> 01:20:07,553
and I had one
of my condoms on still.

1680
01:20:09,555 --> 01:20:11,473
I woke up
the next morning

1681
01:20:11,557 --> 01:20:13,684
and jumped
in the shower with her.

1682
01:20:13,767 --> 01:20:15,644
I don't know
what I was thinking!

1683
01:20:15,728 --> 01:20:17,187
Why did you cheat on her?

1684
01:20:17,270 --> 01:20:19,523
Because I'm insecure!
You can't tell?

1685
01:20:19,606 --> 01:20:22,108
I know,
I know, I know, man.
It's gonna be okay.

1686
01:20:22,192 --> 01:20:24,110
- I'm cold.
- It's gonna be
all right, man.

1687
01:20:24,194 --> 01:20:26,279
I'm-- seriously, man,
I'm sorry.

1688
01:20:26,363 --> 01:20:29,824
I apologize to you.
I know. If you want to have
a meaningful relationship,

1689
01:20:29,908 --> 01:20:31,993
you gotta leave
the sex out of it,
man, you're right.

1690
01:20:32,077 --> 01:20:34,538
- It's all right.
You're good. Okay.
- I'm sorry.

1691
01:20:34,621 --> 01:20:36,956
- Come here.
I love you, man.
- Oh, man, I love you too.

1692
01:20:37,040 --> 01:20:38,958
( crying )

1693
01:20:39,042 --> 01:20:41,294
- You're a good guy.
- ( exhales )

1694
01:20:41,378 --> 01:20:44,214
Do you know how I know
you guys are gay, hmm?

1695
01:20:44,297 --> 01:20:46,216
You're holding each other
ever so gently.

1696
01:20:46,299 --> 01:20:48,468
- ( Andy sighs )
- <i>Cabrón.</i>

- Yeah.
- Like what do you
want to do?

1722

- What are your dreams?
- Uh...

1723
01:21:59,914 --> 01:22:02,501
You don't want
to work at Smart Tech
for the rest of your life.

1724
01:22:02,584 --> 01:22:05,003
- I-- I've been working there
for a long time...
- Yeah.

1725
01:22:05,086 --> 01:22:08,006
...and I've been thinking
lately that maybe I should
open my own store.

1726
01:22:08,089 --> 01:22:10,008
- ( gasps )
Really?
- Yeah.

1727
01:22:10,091 --> 01:22:13,846
- What kind of store?
- Well, like a stereo store.

1728
01:22:13,928 --> 01:22:16,055
Oh my God, that is--
so why don't you do that?!

1729
01:22:16,139 --> 01:22:17,766
I don't have
enough money
to do that.

1730
01:22:17,850 --> 01:22:20,268
What about those collectibles?
I bet if you sold those,

1731
01:22:20,352 --> 01:22:21,770
you could make
a lot of money.

1732
01:22:21,854 --> 01:22:25,565
I just sold
a guy's G.I. Joe
for 1,000 bucks!

1733
01:22:25,649 --> 01:22:27,400
- Really?
- Do you have
any of those?

1734
01:22:27,484 --> 01:22:29,152
- Yeah.
- You do?

1735
01:22:29,235 --> 01:22:31,404
- I have 47 of 'em.
- ( laughs ) No, you don't!

1736
01:22:31,488 --> 01:22:33,031
- Yeah, in the original boxes.
- You don't!

1737
01:22:33,114 --> 01:22:35,241
I could help you
sell them on eBay,

1738
01:22:35,325 --> 01:22:38,411
and I-- I mean,
I would not take
a commission, I swear to God!

1739
01:22:38,495 --> 01:22:41,247
You could do it.
You could totally
pull it off.

1740
01:22:43,124 --> 01:22:45,377
- Yeah, let's do it.
- Let's do it.

a farm
with lots of land,

1744
01:23:15,657 --> 01:23:18,993
so you and other Aquamen
can run around,

1745
01:23:19,077 --> 01:23:21,830
play in the Aqua-fields.

Okay, you can stay.

1748
01:23:39,389 --> 01:23:42,267

Yeah, right.

- <i>( door opens )</i>

1753
01:23:53,486 --> 01:23:55,447
- Hello? Hello?
- Marla: <i>You know what?!</i>

1754
01:23:55,530 --> 01:23:57,950
What the hell are you
talking about? Oh my God,
I cannot believe this.

1755
01:23:58,032 --> 01:24:00,493
- Thank God you're here.
Oh Jesus Christ.
- Hi.

1756
01:24:00,577 --> 01:24:03,121
- Marla locked herself
in the bathroom.
- What happened?

1757
01:24:03,204 --> 01:24:06,040
She wants to go
to the family health clinic.
She wants birth control,

1758
01:24:06,124 --> 01:24:08,167
- but she's too young!
- ( screaming ) I want
to have sex

1759
01:24:08,251 --> 01:24:10,253
with my boyfriend,
but I can't, Mom!

1760
01:24:10,336 --> 01:24:12,046
So you want me
to take her?

1761
01:24:12,130 --> 01:24:14,090
- No, I don't
want you to take her!
- Okay, all right.

1762
01:24:14,173 --> 01:24:16,927
I want her
to keep it in her pants
until she gets to college!

1763
01:24:17,010 --> 01:24:19,345
Whoa whoa whoa!
Keep it in my pants?!

1764
01:24:19,429 --> 01:24:21,264
Okay, you didn't
keep it in your pants, Mom!

1765
01:24:21,347 --> 01:24:22,766
- Hey, Marla.
- I know!

1766
01:24:22,849 --> 01:24:25,226
I don't want you to make
the same mistakes as me!

1767
01:24:25,310 --> 01:24:28,814
Oh, mistakes?
Okay, so I was
a mistake then?!

1768
01:24:28,897 --> 01:24:30,774
No, you're not
a mistake!

1769
01:24:30,857 --> 01:24:32,358
Your sister
was the mistake.

1770
01:24:32,442 --> 01:24:35,528
( screeches )
Oh my God!

1771
01:24:35,612 --> 01:24:37,363
Her older sister--
I mean, she wasn't planned.

1772
01:24:37,447 --> 01:24:39,407
You know what I mean?
Because I was such a--

1773
01:24:39,491 --> 01:24:41,034
Oh God, you wanna
run away, don't you?

1774
01:24:41,117 --> 01:24:43,036
- Nope.
- You and your boyfriend...

1775
01:24:43,119 --> 01:24:44,704
have sex all the time!

1776
01:24:44,788 --> 01:24:46,748
Oh my God!
Are you kidding?!

1777
01:24:46,832 --> 01:24:49,417
- We never have sex.
Do we ever have sex?
- No, we don't.

1778
01:24:49,501 --> 01:24:51,837
What?!
Yes, you do!

1779
01:24:51,920 --> 01:24:54,714
You're such a liar!
Why are you lying
to me? Why?

1780
01:24:54,798 --> 01:24:56,967
<i>( slams door,</i>
<i>babbling )</i>

1781
01:24:58,760 --> 01:25:01,262
I didn't hear anything
after "liar."

1782
01:25:01,346 --> 01:25:04,182
- What did she
say after "liar"?
- She sounds like a teakettle.

1783
01:25:04,265 --> 01:25:07,060
Fuck you!

1784
01:25:07,143 --> 01:25:09,562
- What sh--
- Maybe I should take her.

1785
01:25:09,646 --> 01:25:13,650
- No, I don't think so.
- A little information
never hurt anybody.

1786
01:25:27,914 --> 01:25:29,499
( whispering )
Cool.

1787
01:25:29,582 --> 01:25:30,667
Wow.

1788
01:25:32,961 --> 01:25:35,547
Where-- where do
you put the penis?

1789
01:25:36,798 --> 01:25:40,010
<i>( clatters )</i>

1790
01:25:40,093 --> 01:25:41,970
Now, you're all here
because you're interested

1791
01:25:42,054 --> 01:25:44,514
in obtaining birth
control. Any questions?

1792
01:25:44,597 --> 01:25:46,641
( clears throat )
Here's a cute story.

1793
01:25:46,725 --> 01:25:49,644
I came home the other day
and he is with his girlfriend

1794
01:25:49,728 --> 01:25:51,563
in my marital bed

1795
01:25:51,646 --> 01:25:53,940
doing things that are
illegal in Alabama.

1796
01:25:54,024 --> 01:25:57,318
Sex acts, right?
Things that my wife
won't do, okay?

1797
01:25:57,402 --> 01:26:00,822
- Did you have a question?
- How do I get my
wife to do that?

1798
01:26:00,906 --> 01:26:02,657
Does anybody else
have a question?

1799
01:26:02,741 --> 01:26:04,617
My daughter is--

1800
01:26:04,701 --> 01:26:07,328
for lack of
a better word-- dumb.

1801
01:26:07,412 --> 01:26:09,372
How do I stop her
menstrual cycle?

1802
01:26:09,455 --> 01:26:11,708
You want her to stop
having a menstrual cycle?

1803
01:26:11,791 --> 01:26:14,127
I want to stop it--
maybe just for a few years.

1804
01:26:14,210 --> 01:26:16,796
Yeah, I don't think
that's a good idea.

1805
01:26:16,880 --> 01:26:19,966
- <i>Does anybody else</i>
<i> have a question? </i>
- I have a question.

1806
01:26:20,050 --> 01:26:21,634
I think some
of the people here

1807
01:26:21,718 --> 01:26:24,054
might be sexually
inexperienced.

1808
01:26:24,137 --> 01:26:27,515
Is it true that
if you don't use it,
you lose it?

1809
01:26:27,599 --> 01:26:29,434
Is that a serious question?

1810
01:26:29,517 --> 01:26:31,770
No, it wasn't.

1811
01:26:31,853 --> 01:26:35,356
Now, there are
a lot of activities
you can engage in

1812
01:26:35,440 --> 01:26:38,484
without having sex that
are both fun and safe.

1813
01:26:38,568 --> 01:26:40,695
What sort
of activities?
I think...

1814
01:26:40,779 --> 01:26:43,322
everybody wants to know
about the activities.

1815
01:26:43,406 --> 01:26:45,658
Well, instead of
having intercourse,

1816
01:26:45,742 --> 01:26:48,078
you could have
outercourse.

1817
01:26:48,161 --> 01:26:49,996
"Outercourse"?
Ew, what's that?

1818
01:26:50,080 --> 01:26:52,124
Yeah, what is that?

1819
01:26:52,206 --> 01:26:55,835
Outercourse is
anything that <i>isn't </i>
vaginal intercourse.

1820
01:26:55,919 --> 01:26:57,921
I prefer vaginal
intercourse.

1821
01:26:59,131 --> 01:27:01,091
( chuckles )
He really does.

1822
01:27:01,174 --> 01:27:03,718
Now, there are ways
of having sex

1823
01:27:03,802 --> 01:27:06,012
without intercourse.

1824
01:27:06,096 --> 01:27:08,347
Let's see, there are
things like body rubbing

1825
01:27:08,431 --> 01:27:10,809
- <i>or dry humping. </i>
- You could dry hump.

1826
01:27:10,892 --> 01:27:14,104
- There's masturbation,
- Masturbation, play
with yourself.

1827
01:27:14,187 --> 01:27:16,397
- Mutual masturbation,
- Play with a friend.

1828
01:27:16,481 --> 01:27:19,818
Deep kissing.
There's erotic massage.

1829
01:27:19,901 --> 01:27:21,736
Oh, that sounds
like it would be nice.

1830
01:27:21,820 --> 01:27:24,489
- Oral sex play.
- Sounds like
my Friday night.

1831
01:27:24,572 --> 01:27:26,324
Shut up, Seth,
we went to temple.

1832
01:27:26,407 --> 01:27:28,409
Okay, are there
any virgins here

1833
01:27:28,493 --> 01:27:30,536
who are thinking
about having sex
for the first time?

1834
01:27:32,413 --> 01:27:34,499
- Oh.
- ( laughing )

1835
01:27:34,582 --> 01:27:37,794
Wait, so you're a virgin?
( laughs )

1836
01:27:37,877 --> 01:27:39,712
I'd tap that.

1837
01:27:39,796 --> 01:27:41,673
Oh, yeah, you'd
"tap that." Seth, what?

1838
01:27:41,756 --> 01:27:44,217
You think you're cool
with your little Jew-fro?

1839
01:27:44,300 --> 01:27:47,720
<i>We don't say "tap that."</i>
<i>What-- what are you </i>
<i>talking about, Seth?</i>

1840
01:27:47,804 --> 01:27:50,015
You know what?
I'm a virgin, too.

1841
01:27:50,098 --> 01:27:52,892
- ( men laughing )
- Hey, that's--

1842
01:27:52,976 --> 01:27:55,061
- We're virgins too.
- Yeah.

1843
01:27:55,145 --> 01:27:56,938
( laughing )

1844
01:27:57,022 --> 01:27:59,315
No, you know what?
It's a personal choice,

1845
01:27:59,398 --> 01:28:01,651
and-- and I don't
think it's weird at all.

1846
01:28:01,734 --> 01:28:04,612
You know what your
problem is? You're putting
the pussy on a pedestal.

1847
01:28:04,696 --> 01:28:06,280
That's the second
time I've heard that.

1848
01:28:06,364 --> 01:28:08,741
<i> What is the pussy</i>
<i>on a pedestal thing?</i>

1849
01:28:08,825 --> 01:28:11,244
Okay, I can't listen
to any more of this,

1850
01:28:11,327 --> 01:28:13,788
'cause it's making
me sick, so bye.

1851
01:28:13,872 --> 01:28:16,124
- You can get this information
on your website, right?
- <i>Oh, yes.</i>

1852
01:28:16,208 --> 01:28:18,584
- Thanks, nice
meeting everybody.
- <i>Any other questions?</i>

1853
01:28:18,668 --> 01:28:20,837
Do you have any
extra-large condoms?

1854
01:28:20,920 --> 01:28:22,922
Seth, you've got
a tiny penis.

1855
01:28:27,177 --> 01:28:29,804
So, I made that all
up to help you out.

1856
01:28:32,057 --> 01:28:34,059
No, you didn't.

1857
01:28:34,142 --> 01:28:36,644
But, um, thank you

1858
01:28:36,728 --> 01:28:38,771
for doing that.

1859
01:28:40,273 --> 01:28:42,275
How can you tell?

1860
01:28:42,358 --> 01:28:44,610
Well, you know,
I go to school
with like 400 guys

1861
01:28:44,694 --> 01:28:46,696
- who are all trying
to have sex.
- Wow.

1862
01:28:46,779 --> 01:28:49,282
- Yeah, so I can
tell who's done it.
- Of course.

1863
01:28:49,365 --> 01:28:52,410
- And you really haven't.
- No, I really haven't.

1864
01:28:52,493 --> 01:28:54,954
Please don't tell
your mom, okay?

1865
01:28:55,038 --> 01:28:56,956
- Yeah, I won't.
- Thanks.

1866
01:28:57,040 --> 01:28:59,876
But-- when are you
gonna tell her?

1867
01:28:59,959 --> 01:29:01,961
Believe me,
I'm working on it.

1868
01:29:03,255 --> 01:29:05,173
I am working on it.

1869

1871
01:29:12,138 --> 01:29:14,015
I think she
likes you, man.

1872
01:29:14,099 --> 01:29:17,185
Hmm, I know. Too bad
I retired my cock.

beautiful? Come here!

Looks like a poltergeist.

That is his foot.

1878
01:29:30,573 --> 01:29:32,325
Look at his dick.
That's not even four months.

1879
01:29:32,408 --> 01:29:34,660
Extrapolate that.

1880
01:29:34,744 --> 01:29:37,371
<i>By the time he's 30,</i>
<i>what's going to happen?</i>
<i>Hey, yo, Andy!</i>

Yo, come check
this out, dawg.

Oh, is this the movie about
babies that are geniuses?

1883
01:29:42,460 --> 01:29:45,504
- No, no. This is my child,
dude. Jill is pregnant.
- That's yours?

1884
01:29:45,588 --> 01:29:48,091
Yeah! That's why
she broke up with me
in the first place

1885
01:29:48,174 --> 01:29:50,509
'cause she just
thought I wouldn't
be a really good father

1886
01:29:50,593 --> 01:29:54,222
in light of the fact
that I be cheating on her all
the time, but she got over that.

1887
01:29:54,306 --> 01:29:56,266
Congratulations,
man, that is great!

1888
01:29:56,349 --> 01:29:59,352
We having a party
tonight, Andy, and I
really want you to be there.

1889
01:29:59,435 --> 01:30:01,854
We celebrating and I really,
really want you to be there.

1890
01:30:01,938 --> 01:30:04,523
It looks like
the doppler radar.

1891
01:30:04,607 --> 01:30:06,901
Can you believe that?
This child ain't even
four months old.

1892
01:30:06,985 --> 01:30:09,654
He ain't even
four months old yet,
look at what he's packing.

Everybody dick
looks big on 60" TV.

<i> Eric Gilliland?</i>

- Uh-huh.
- He has bought
like 15 of these.

1897
01:30:21,540 --> 01:30:25,044
- Really?
- Yeah, I think he likes action
figures even more than you.

1898
01:30:25,128 --> 01:30:27,755
- That is impossible.
- I think so.

1899
01:30:27,839 --> 01:30:31,676
Andy, the way these things
are flying off your shelf,

1900
01:30:31,759 --> 01:30:35,054
you know, I think you
could actually make like--

1901
01:30:35,138 --> 01:30:37,223
- maybe like $100,000.
- Really?

1902
01:30:37,307 --> 01:30:39,100
Yeah, you could
open your store.

1903
01:30:39,184 --> 01:30:40,893
- <i>Wow. </i>
- I mean--

1904

- <i>That's a lot of money. </i>
- I know.

1905
01:30:43,313 --> 01:30:45,564
That's incredible.
I wouldn't have done it
without you.

Thanks.

the only good news.

- No.
- No? Is it...

1911
01:30:58,370 --> 01:31:00,330
"The Apprentice"?

1912
01:31:00,413 --> 01:31:02,915
- No.
- Hmm, what?

1913
01:31:06,002 --> 01:31:07,837
It's our...

1914
01:31:07,920 --> 01:31:10,589
20th date.

1915
01:31:16,595 --> 01:31:18,431
- Wow.
- Yeah.

1916
01:31:18,514 --> 01:31:20,516
- Really?
- Uh-huh.

1917
01:31:20,599 --> 01:31:23,436
- Seriously? I think--
I think we're at 18.
- Nuh-uh.

1918
01:31:23,519 --> 01:31:26,022
There were a couple
dates there that don't
count as dates.

1919
01:31:26,105 --> 01:31:29,067
No. I'll give you a free
pass on those other ones.

1920
01:31:30,902 --> 01:31:32,987
- Thank you.
- Listen.

1921
01:31:33,071 --> 01:31:35,073
- What? Mm-hmm.
- Listen.

1922
01:31:36,157 --> 01:31:38,117
I really like you.

1923
01:31:38,201 --> 01:31:40,203
I-- I--

1924
01:31:41,829 --> 01:31:43,664
( sighs )

1925
01:31:43,748 --> 01:31:45,917
I think I'm
falling for you.

1926
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,627
I don't know.
I kinda see this...

1927
01:31:48,711 --> 01:31:51,047
- going somewhere.
- I do too.

1928
01:31:51,130 --> 01:31:54,592
I just think we should
just go crazy on each other.

1929
01:31:56,135 --> 01:31:58,637
- Okay.
- Okay?

1930
01:31:58,721 --> 01:32:00,848
Oh, thank God.

1931
01:32:03,268 --> 01:32:04,810
Oh!

1932
01:32:04,894 --> 01:32:06,812
Okay, I should--
I gotta pick those up.

1933
01:32:06,896 --> 01:32:09,190
Wait, no,
pick them up later.

1934
01:32:09,274 --> 01:32:12,235
- No, I have to pick
those up right now.
- Wait, we'll get 'em later.

1935
01:32:12,318 --> 01:32:13,903
Listen, it's really
important because

1936
01:32:13,986 --> 01:32:16,239
once the integrity of
the box gets compromised--

1937
01:32:16,322 --> 01:32:19,158
this is original packaging
and that's why these
things are so valuable.

1938
01:32:19,242 --> 01:32:20,952
So you don't-- you
don't screw with that.

1939
01:32:21,035 --> 01:32:22,828
- You really don't
screw with that.
- All right.

1940
01:32:22,912 --> 01:32:25,081
Well, we can wrap 'em
again later, you know?

1941
01:32:25,164 --> 01:32:27,708
Yeah, but you
know what? This is very
important that we don't--

1942
01:32:27,792 --> 01:32:30,086
- we don't lose the value
or compromise the integrity--
- Andy, I'm...

1943
01:32:30,169 --> 01:32:32,464
throwing myself at you

1944
01:32:32,546 --> 01:32:35,341
- and all you can think
about is fucking toys!
- They're not fucking toys!

1945
01:32:35,425 --> 01:32:37,343
This is Iron Man, okay?

1946
01:32:37,427 --> 01:32:39,887
I got this when
I was in 2nd grade!

1947
01:32:39,971 --> 01:32:42,890
- Do you know how hard it is
for a kid to not open that?
- Uh-huh.

1948
01:32:42,974 --> 01:32:45,143
This is important,
these are my things

1949
01:32:45,226 --> 01:32:48,354
and you are trying
to make me sell them
and I don't want to.

1950
01:32:48,438 --> 01:32:50,398
- No.
- And you're making me.

1951
01:32:50,482 --> 01:32:53,067
- I-- I'm not making--
- You're encouraging me
to quit my job.

1952
01:32:53,151 --> 01:32:56,112
- I'm not! I'm not trying--
- You want me to open a store!

1953
01:32:56,195 --> 01:32:59,198
You want me to sell
everything. You know what?
I'm gonna tell you something.

1954
01:32:59,282 --> 01:33:01,742
I don't just <i>change </i>like that.
I can't just <i>change </i>for you.

1955
01:33:01,826 --> 01:33:03,828
I don't-- I'm not
trying to change you.

1956
01:33:03,911 --> 01:33:05,955
I like you!

1957
01:33:06,038 --> 01:33:09,542
- I'm trying to help
you grow up, Andy.
- Well, thanks a lot.

1958
01:33:09,625 --> 01:33:12,711
I mean, my God,
you ride a bicycle to
work in a stockroom--

1959
01:33:12,795 --> 01:33:15,548
You know what? I'm not
in the stockroom anymore,

1960
01:33:15,631 --> 01:33:17,425
- I'm a floor manager.
- Okay.

1961
01:33:17,509 --> 01:33:19,969
I ride a bike
because I like to.
Einstein rode a bike.

1962
01:33:20,052 --> 01:33:23,097
He had a wife,
who he <i>fucked, </i>by the way.

1963
01:33:23,181 --> 01:33:25,808
What do I have to do
for you to have sex with me?

1964
01:33:25,891 --> 01:33:28,853
Do you want me to
dress up like Thor?
I'll dress up like Thor.

1965
01:33:28,936 --> 01:33:32,357
I'll dress up like Iron Man.
What do they do? I'll do it!

1966
01:33:32,440 --> 01:33:34,442
Why-- everything's
always about sex.

1967
01:33:34,526 --> 01:33:36,861
Why don't you want to
have sex with me? Why not?

1968
01:33:36,944 --> 01:33:40,739
You tell me the truth.
Is it because I have a kid
who has a kid? Is that why?

1969
01:33:40,823 --> 01:33:43,409
No, it's cool!
I love the fact that
you're a grandmother.

1970
01:33:43,493 --> 01:33:46,287
- Oh God!
- You are! You're
a hot grandma!

1971
01:33:46,371 --> 01:33:48,789
Oh my God!
You are <i>so </i>mean!

1972
01:33:48,873 --> 01:33:50,708
- <i>Get out! </i>
- Okay, fine, good!

1973
01:33:50,791 --> 01:33:53,711
- Good, fine, you're gonna go.
- I didn't ask for any of this.

1974
01:33:53,794 --> 01:33:58,049
- You asked for
all of it, Andy!
- Okay, great.

1975
01:34:00,885 --> 01:34:04,263
Hey, if that's
the way you want it,

1976
01:34:04,347 --> 01:34:06,849
that's the way
homie's gonna play it.

1977
01:34:07,933 --> 01:34:09,935
Yeah, truth be told.

1978
01:34:19,278 --> 01:34:21,280

01:34:31,541 --> 01:34:33,667
- you ain't going out again

- Me?

1984
01:34:33,751 --> 01:34:35,920
- Yeah.
- You the club rat. I'm

1985

I'm not a club rat.

Dude, I'm not gonna
hit on Bernadette.

1989
01:34:46,305 --> 01:34:48,600
Yes, you are, man!
'Cause your depression

1990
01:34:48,682 --> 01:34:52,270
is boring me for one thing
and it's actually making
me a little depressed.

1991
01:34:52,353 --> 01:34:55,607
Which is then in turn making me
more depressed that you're
actually affecting my mood.

1992
01:34:55,689 --> 01:34:57,650
Look, I'm not in
any kind of place

1993
01:34:57,733 --> 01:34:59,485
to talk to a woman,
all right?

1994
01:34:59,569 --> 01:35:01,446
I'm just--
I'm fragile.

1995
01:35:01,529 --> 01:35:03,656
I hired her for <i>you.</i>

1996
01:35:03,739 --> 01:35:06,033
I hired a 90-lb. girl
to work in the stock room

1997
01:35:06,117 --> 01:35:08,661
at Smart Tech
for you, okay?

1998
01:35:08,744 --> 01:35:10,371
I should've hired
a 300-lb. guy

1999
01:35:10,455 --> 01:35:12,498
who could lift
a 60" wide screen,

2000
01:35:12,582 --> 01:35:14,833
but instead
I hired a hot girl

2001
01:35:14,917 --> 01:35:18,003
who can't lift
an iPod to bring you
out of your funk.

2002
01:35:18,087 --> 01:35:20,673
- You hired her for me?
- Yes!

2003
01:35:20,756 --> 01:35:23,175
- So will you
go talk to her?
- Yeah, I'm meeting somebody.

2004
01:35:23,259 --> 01:35:25,553
No.

2005
01:35:28,347 --> 01:35:30,849
- Did you just flick me
in the nuts?
- No.

2006
01:35:30,933 --> 01:35:33,686
I flicked you in
the fleshy patch where
your nuts <i>used </i>to be.

2007
01:35:33,769 --> 01:35:36,981
Ow! Quit flickin'
my balls, man!

2008
01:35:37,064 --> 01:35:39,651
Okay, I'll stop
flickin' your balls.

2009
01:35:39,733 --> 01:35:41,819
But I'll start

2010
01:35:42,945 --> 01:35:45,448

2011
01:35:48,951 --> 01:35:51,412
- Well played, sir.
- Okay.

- How many times have you gone

out of here.
- What happened?

- Wow wow.

2230
01:46:31,468 --> 01:46:34,638
- Oh my God.
- Yep, just--
I'm gonna need a minute.

2231
01:46:34,721 --> 01:46:36,890
- Oh my--
- I'm in a lot
of pain right now.

2232
01:46:36,974 --> 01:46:39,226
Oh my God,
are you okay?

2233
01:46:39,310 --> 01:46:41,561
( groans )
There were two sides
to that billboard,

2234
01:46:41,645 --> 01:46:43,396
and they both
hurt equally.

2235
01:46:43,480 --> 01:46:46,233
Oh, Andy! Andy.

2236
01:46:46,317 --> 01:46:48,068
( exhales )

2237
01:46:48,152 --> 01:46:50,904
- Are you okay?
- I'm okay.

2238
01:46:50,988 --> 01:46:53,406
No, I'm not okay.

2239
01:46:53,490 --> 01:46:55,367
I'm a virgin.

2240
01:46:57,369 --> 01:46:59,454
A what?

2241
01:46:59,537 --> 01:47:03,041
I'm a virgin.
I always have been.

2242
01:47:03,125 --> 01:47:06,461
- Shoot.
- Andy, is that what
all this was about?

2243
01:47:06,544 --> 01:47:08,630
I'm sorry.

2244
01:47:08,713 --> 01:47:11,424
You're just
a virgin, that's all?

2245
01:47:11,508 --> 01:47:14,136
- Yeah.
- That's good.
That's a good thing.

2246
01:47:15,804 --> 01:47:17,931
I feel stupid.

2247
01:47:19,808 --> 01:47:22,186
It's okay, I thought you
were trying to kill me.

2248
01:47:22,269 --> 01:47:24,271

2249
01:47:24,355 --> 01:47:26,106
No.

2250
01:47:26,190 --> 01:47:28,192
Oh my God.

2251
01:47:28,275 --> 01:47:30,277
No, I'm not trying
to kill you.

2252
01:47:33,989 --> 01:47:36,825
( grunts )
That's why I never tried
to have sex with you.

2253
01:47:36,908 --> 01:47:39,119
I was scared.

2254
01:47:39,203 --> 01:47:41,079
Okay, I just--

2255
01:47:41,163 --> 01:47:42,956
'cause I didn't know
what I was doing,

2256
01:47:43,040 --> 01:47:45,292
I just didn't think
it would be good.

2257
01:47:45,376 --> 01:47:47,752
Of course it'll be good,
we love each other.

2258
01:47:49,546 --> 01:47:51,798
Really?

2259
01:47:51,882 --> 01:47:53,842
I love you.

2260
01:47:55,302 --> 01:47:57,304
Yeah.

2261
01:47:59,764 --> 01:48:02,976

Get the fuck out
of the road, virgin!

2262
01:48:03,060 --> 01:48:06,730
Shut up,
you fuckin' jerk!

2263
01:48:06,813 --> 01:48:09,400
No, that's okay.
That's all right! Sorry!

2264
01:48:11,068 --> 01:48:12,986
You know what?
For so long,

2265
01:48:13,070 --> 01:48:15,572
I've thought that there
was something wrong with me,

2266
01:48:15,655 --> 01:48:17,490
because it had
never happened.

2267
01:48:17,574 --> 01:48:20,160
But...

2268
01:48:20,244 --> 01:48:24,373
I realize now that
it was just because
I was waiting for you.

2269
01:48:49,314 --> 01:48:51,942
This is some wedding.
How did they pay
for all of it?

2270
01:48:52,025 --> 01:48:55,737
Dude sells his toys and makes
like a half a million dollars.

2271
01:48:55,820 --> 01:48:57,697
- That's crazy, right?
- That's fuckin' crazy.

2272
01:48:57,781 --> 01:48:59,699
We gonna get
some fuckin' toys.

2273
01:48:59,783 --> 01:49:01,910
We are all so
happy for you,

2274
01:49:01,993 --> 01:49:04,204
and I am delighted

2275
01:49:04,288 --> 01:49:06,206
to say these words:

2276
01:49:06,290 --> 01:49:09,084
Andy, you may
kiss the bride.
