1
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:09,202
- Guess how fast we're going now.
- I don't care, I'm having a baby!

2
00:01:09,405 --> 00:01:12,339
Hundred and five miles an hour,
you believe that?

3
00:01:17,747 --> 00:01:20,375
Reese, you just passed the hospital!

4
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:25,252
- The baby's coming, he's coming now!
- All right, all right, hold on.

5
00:01:25,454 --> 00:01:28,355
- Okay, but I think he might be stuck.
- Grab onto something. Ready?

6
00:01:28,557 --> 00:01:30,491
One, two, three!

7
00:01:36,932 --> 00:01:39,366
It's a baby boy.

8
00:01:41,704 --> 00:01:44,639
I'm happy that Waffle House
was okay with me coming here...

9
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,933
...to talk to y'all about
my day-to-day.

10
00:01:47,309 --> 00:01:49,938
And, y'all, that's pretty much,
in a shell...

11
00:01:50,146 --> 00:01:52,307
...what it's like to manage
a Waffle House.

12
00:01:52,515 --> 00:01:55,040
Ma'am, I don't know what else
you want me to say to them.

13
00:01:55,251 --> 00:01:57,686
And I'm also gonna need to know
where your commode's at.

14
00:01:57,888 --> 00:02:00,412
Okay, let's give him a round
of applause. Thank you.

15
00:02:01,924 --> 00:02:04,621
Okay, next up is Ricky Bobby.
Ricky, is your father here?

16
00:02:04,828 --> 00:02:08,059
No, ma'am.
I haven't seen my daddy in years.

17
00:02:08,265 --> 00:02:10,323
But my mama say he's out
racing cars...

18
00:02:10,533 --> 00:02:12,900
...and, well, dipping his wick
in anything that moves.

19
00:02:14,237 --> 00:02:17,434
Okay, kids, that's enough.
We're gonna move on to Brennan.

20
00:02:17,841 --> 00:02:19,603
Don't pay them no mind, Ricky.

21
00:02:19,809 --> 00:02:23,075
Thanks, Cal. Shake and Bake.
You'll be my best friend forever.

22
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,043
His job is like as a prison guard.

23
00:02:26,082 --> 00:02:28,073
Excuse me, darling.
I'm Reese Bobby.

24
00:02:28,285 --> 00:02:30,651
I'm here for career day
with my son, Ricky.

25
00:02:31,154 --> 00:02:33,554
- Dad!
- Hey there, boy!

26
00:02:33,757 --> 00:02:36,591
Man, you got big. How long's it been?
Three, four months?

27
00:02:36,794 --> 00:02:38,693
- Ten years.
- Ten years?

28
00:02:38,895 --> 00:02:41,056
Man, I gotta lay off the peyote.

29
00:02:41,264 --> 00:02:42,856
Mr. Bobby,
there's no smoking in here.

30
00:02:43,066 --> 00:02:44,830
It's all right, I'm a volunteer fireman.

31
00:02:45,136 --> 00:02:48,798
Okay, I am a semi-professional
racecar driver...

32
00:02:49,005 --> 00:02:51,634
...and an amateur tattoo artist.

33
00:02:53,544 --> 00:02:56,808
And the first thing you gotta learn
if you're gonna be a racecar driver...

34
00:02:57,013 --> 00:02:58,537
...is you don't listen to losers...

35
00:02:58,748 --> 00:03:02,014
...like your know-it-all teacher here.
- Okay, I think that's enough.

36
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:05,155
Your teacher wants you to go slow,
and she's wrong...

37
00:03:05,356 --> 00:03:08,951
...because it's the fastest who gets paid
and it's the fastest who gets laid.

38
00:03:11,963 --> 00:03:14,454
Oh, yeah.
You know what I'm talking about.

39
00:03:15,234 --> 00:03:17,167
You people are in the wrong
on this one!

40
00:03:17,368 --> 00:03:18,562
So in the wrong!

41
00:03:18,769 --> 00:03:22,569
This is egregious,
do you hear me? Egregious!

42
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:29,041
We were cellmates together, Andy.
You got payback coming!

43
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:32,642
Dad!

44
00:03:32,851 --> 00:03:35,284
Don't listen to these people, Ricky.
You're a winner.

45
00:03:35,486 --> 00:03:40,390
You got the gift. Always remember,
if you ain't first, you're last.

46
00:03:43,595 --> 00:03:47,190
If you ain't first, you're last.

47
00:03:48,033 --> 00:03:50,524
- See you when you're grown up.
- Dad! Come back, Dad!

48
00:04:03,682 --> 00:04:05,206
It's a hot one here in Talladega

49
00:04:05,417 --> 00:04:09,980
<i>and this crowd of over 180,000
is enjoying one heck of a day,</i>

50
00:04:24,102 --> 00:04:27,766
Yo, Terry. Terry, we got the caution.
Bring it in for a pit. Let's work on it.

51
00:04:39,218 --> 00:04:41,277
All right, fellas, let's go.

52
00:04:41,521 --> 00:04:44,046
Looking good. Yes, come on.

53
00:04:44,257 --> 00:04:45,519
Keep it up, baby.

54
00:04:46,459 --> 00:04:48,825
- All right, way to go.
- Go, way to go.

55
00:04:49,363 --> 00:04:50,591
Nice jack work, Ricky.

56
00:04:50,797 --> 00:04:52,458
Hey, Shake and Bake, Cal.

57
00:04:53,132 --> 00:04:55,794
- Shake and Bake!
- Terry, it's all on you, bro. You go.

58
00:04:56,002 --> 00:04:58,096
Go, baby, go.
Wait, what are you doing?

59
00:04:58,305 --> 00:05:01,034
- I gotta take a piss.
- Go, go, go!

60
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,868
It doesn't matter, Lucius.
We're in last place. Relax.

61
00:05:04,077 --> 00:05:06,808
Jeez, I gotta go take a whiz.
Get off my ass.

62
00:05:07,014 --> 00:05:08,948
You see,
this is what I'm talking about.

63
00:05:09,149 --> 00:05:12,641
That's why this group right here
is the laughingstock of NASCAR.

64
00:05:12,853 --> 00:05:14,411
Face it, we suck.

65
00:05:14,622 --> 00:05:18,388
It's not always bad to be in last place.
Here's some things we can focus on:

66
00:05:18,592 --> 00:05:21,720
One, we tried hard.
And two, we're still dear friends.

67
00:05:21,929 --> 00:05:23,226
Glenn, shut up.

68
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:25,990
I see Terry.
He's having a chicken sandwich.

69
00:05:27,034 --> 00:05:30,993
Hey, fellas! These are really good.
You should try one.

70
00:05:31,205 --> 00:05:33,036
That place actually makes
a nice sauce.

71
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,401
Let me eat this,
then I gotta make a phone call...

72
00:05:35,609 --> 00:05:38,339
...then I'm coming back, all right?
- This is the bottom line.

73
00:05:38,545 --> 00:05:40,513
If we don't get that car
back on the track...

74
00:05:40,714 --> 00:05:43,205
...our sponsors are gonna
shit a chicken.

75
00:05:43,417 --> 00:05:48,320
Now, is there anyone out there
who wants to go fast? Anybody?

76
00:05:50,024 --> 00:05:51,651
I wanna go fast.

77
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:55,421
Hey, get him a suit. Hurry up,
make it snappy. Let's go.

78
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:57,927
- Hustle up, hustle up.
- Hey, man!

79
00:05:58,198 --> 00:06:01,691
Remember when we got kicked out of
biology for playing with Matchbox cars?

80
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:04,303
- Yeah!
- Who's retarded now?

81
00:06:04,506 --> 00:06:07,474
- Yeah.
- Hey, what are you doing after this?

82
00:06:07,676 --> 00:06:09,166
- After the race?
- Yeah.

83
00:06:09,377 --> 00:06:12,346
I don't know, but it feels like
we're wasting a lot of time.

84
00:06:12,547 --> 00:06:14,674
No, I know, I know.
I'm just excited, man!

85
00:06:14,883 --> 00:06:18,182
- Yeah, I know. Yeah.
- Hey! I love you!

86
00:06:18,386 --> 00:06:19,944
- What?
- Nothing.

87
00:06:20,889 --> 00:06:22,948
Shake and Bake! Get some!

88
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:27,256
You're my best friend!
You're my best friend!

89
00:06:27,462 --> 00:06:29,157
- Okay, then!
- I'm in there with you!

90
00:06:29,364 --> 00:06:31,230
- I gotta get going!
- Go, go!

91
00:06:36,304 --> 00:06:38,602
- Yeah!
- That's Ricky, baby!

92
00:06:38,807 --> 00:06:40,036
That's my boy, Ricky!

93
00:06:44,513 --> 00:06:46,639
Hey, Ricky,
just remember one thing:

94
00:06:46,849 --> 00:06:49,750
If you wreck that car,
that's 200 grand out of your pocket...

95
00:06:49,952 --> 00:06:51,920
so let's take it nice and slow, okay?

96
00:06:52,121 --> 00:06:55,852
With all due respect, Lucius,
I'm gonna do some driving.

97
00:06:59,128 --> 00:07:00,720
Excuse me, coming through.

98
00:07:02,131 --> 00:07:06,033
<i>Apparently, we've got a situation for
the Laughing Clown, number 26 car,</i>

99
00:07:06,235 --> 00:07:09,033
Terry Cheveaux is refusing to drive,
One of his crew members

100
00:07:09,238 --> 00:07:10,433
has taken the wheel,

101
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:13,904
Hey, just wanted to share a little piece
of personal information with you.

102
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:15,304
I got a chubby right now...

103
00:07:15,511 --> 00:07:18,504
...because this is one of the most
awesome experiences of my life...

104
00:07:18,715 --> 00:07:20,342
...because I'm getting to
drive a racecar!

105
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:23,211
I can't believe it! Oh, my God!

106
00:07:40,971 --> 00:07:42,700
Wow, that was cool.

107
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:44,766
Come on, come on.

108
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:54,444
The big story from Talladega:

109
00:07:54,651 --> 00:07:57,985
Little-known jack-man Ricky Bobby
places third in the Dennit machine.

110
00:07:58,189 --> 00:08:01,521
Ricky, first of all,
where did you learn to drive like that?

111
00:08:01,725 --> 00:08:05,719
In a car.
Car handle really good. Yeah.

112
00:08:06,197 --> 00:08:07,664
Can you speak up, Ricky?

113
00:08:07,865 --> 00:08:09,730
A car.
It handled real good.

114
00:08:09,934 --> 00:08:12,231
So, what do you think, Mr. Dennit?
He sure can drive.

115
00:08:12,435 --> 00:08:15,894
He's got guts.
Dennit Racing needs a racer like him.

116
00:08:16,107 --> 00:08:17,836
Come on, Dad.
He's just a stupid cowboy.

117
00:08:18,042 --> 00:08:19,634
Look how bad he is
in that interview.

118
00:08:19,843 --> 00:08:23,473
Junior, driving has got nothing
to do with interviews.

119
00:08:23,681 --> 00:08:26,707
I just wish to hell you had
a little more stupid cowboy in you.

120
00:08:26,918 --> 00:08:30,376
I felt like I was on a spaceship and...

121
00:08:31,489 --> 00:08:33,116
I'm not sure
what to do with my hands.

122
00:08:33,324 --> 00:08:35,189
Be good to hold them down
by your side.

123
00:08:35,393 --> 00:08:39,557
We're really happy
with what was going on.

124
00:08:39,764 --> 00:08:44,463
And at the end of the day, you know,
you gotta be happy.

125
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:48,765
- What did you say his name was again?
- His name is Ricky. Ricky Bobby.

126
00:08:48,973 --> 00:08:51,464
Ricky Bobby?
He's got two first names.

127
00:08:51,676 --> 00:08:53,645
Whatever his name is,
let's get him over here.

128
00:08:53,846 --> 00:08:56,007
Everything ended up fine.

129
00:08:57,216 --> 00:09:00,344
Yeah, okay, everything was fine.
Thanks, thanks. Great job in the car.

130
00:09:00,552 --> 00:09:02,918
Ricky Bobby, a force to be
reckoned with, possibly...

131
00:09:03,121 --> 00:09:04,520
...in the near future.

132
00:09:04,723 --> 00:09:06,714
Ricky Bobby with yet another
impressive win,

133
00:09:06,925 --> 00:09:08,620
He is dominating NAS CAR,

134
00:09:08,827 --> 00:09:11,352
First or last, baby, you know it!

135
00:09:11,563 --> 00:09:14,532
I've never seen a driver who
wants to win more than this guy,

136
00:09:14,733 --> 00:09:17,031
I could get used to
this winning thing!

137
00:09:30,349 --> 00:09:35,879
Dennit Racing Incorporated
has decided to field an additional car.

138
00:09:36,088 --> 00:09:38,955
And, at the urging of Ricky Bobby...

139
00:09:39,157 --> 00:09:43,219
...who's been like a son to me,
only better...

140
00:09:43,429 --> 00:09:46,886
...l'm naming Cal Naughton Jr.
As the driver.

141
00:09:49,068 --> 00:09:50,558
All right.

142
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:52,397
- Cal Naughton.
- Hey...

143
00:09:52,605 --> 00:09:55,233
...we just want to say to all
you other drivers out there...

144
00:09:55,441 --> 00:09:58,433
...if you smell a delicious,
crispy smell after the race...

145
00:09:58,645 --> 00:10:01,842
...it's not your tailpipe,
it's a little bit...

146
00:10:02,048 --> 00:10:03,414
...of shake...

147
00:10:03,617 --> 00:10:06,016
And then bake.

148
00:10:06,286 --> 00:10:07,617
Shake and Bake!

149
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:10,254
- That's our nickname.
- Get used to hearing it.

150
00:10:10,723 --> 00:10:12,282
And Ricky Bobby wins...

151
00:10:12,493 --> 00:10:14,892
...with Cal Naughton Jr.
Finishing second.

152
00:10:15,862 --> 00:10:18,296
- Yeah!
- Hey, man!

153
00:10:18,832 --> 00:10:20,766
- Shake...
- And bake!

154
00:10:22,469 --> 00:10:25,528
Hey, driver! Drive these.

155
00:10:28,909 --> 00:10:30,376
Please be 18.

156
00:10:40,921 --> 00:10:43,822
You want to make this out
to Charlotte?

157
00:10:44,024 --> 00:10:45,457
Hey, excuse me, Ricky.

158
00:10:45,659 --> 00:10:47,490
- Hey, Dale.
- Hey, can I get your autograph?

159
00:10:47,695 --> 00:10:50,824
- Sure. Who do I make this out to?
- It's for me. I think you're awesome.

160
00:10:51,032 --> 00:10:53,556
- Don't tell the other drivers.
- I'm not gonna tell anyone.

161
00:10:53,767 --> 00:10:55,029
I'll see you out there.

162
00:10:55,235 --> 00:10:57,203
Absolutely, ma'am,
I'd love to sign your baby.

163
00:10:57,404 --> 00:10:59,373
You're not gonna wanna wash
that forehead.

164
00:10:59,774 --> 00:11:03,368
- That's right, Powerade's number one.
- Not just for hydration, for vitamin.

165
00:11:03,577 --> 00:11:06,069
No, it's me,
it's me, Susan, your assistant.

166
00:11:06,281 --> 00:11:08,249
Gotta watch it when I get into
autograph mode.

167
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:11,316
I know, I'm sorry. It's my fault,
I shouldn't have been standing.

168
00:11:11,652 --> 00:11:14,121
I'm Ricky Bobby.
Christmas is right around the corner...

169
00:11:14,322 --> 00:11:16,313
...and what better gift
to give a loved one...

170
00:11:16,524 --> 00:11:18,082
...than the Jackhawk 9000?

171
00:11:18,293 --> 00:11:19,658
Available at Wal-Mart.

172
00:11:19,995 --> 00:11:22,225
When you work on
your mysterious lady-part stuff...

173
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:25,888
...you should have the right tools too.
So that's why you should use...

174
00:11:26,101 --> 00:11:27,932
...Maypax, the official tampon
of NASCAR.

175
00:11:29,805 --> 00:11:30,896
I'm Ricky Bobby.

176
00:11:31,106 --> 00:11:34,269
If you don't chew Big Red,
then f*** you.

177
00:11:38,881 --> 00:11:39,938
Prune candy.

178
00:11:42,384 --> 00:11:43,612
- You happy?
- I'm very happy.

179
00:11:43,818 --> 00:11:46,151
- Hey, I'm Ricky Bobby.
- And I'm Cal Naughton Jr.

180
00:11:46,355 --> 00:11:48,721
Urging you never to travel
to Tijuana.

181
00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:50,648
Ricky! Ricky! Ricky!

182
00:11:50,859 --> 00:11:52,919
Okay, I'm starting to get sick.

183
00:11:53,462 --> 00:11:56,863
Dick Berggren in Las Vegas,
Victory Lane, for Fox Television.

184
00:11:57,066 --> 00:11:59,966
Ricky Bobby, today's big winner.
Heck of a win for you today...

185
00:12:00,168 --> 00:12:04,162
...but it seems as if you either win
or crash the car trying to win.

186
00:12:04,373 --> 00:12:07,467
Well, Dick, here's the deal.
I'm the best there is, plain and simple.

187
00:12:07,676 --> 00:12:10,076
I mean, I wake up in the morning
and I piss excellence.

188
00:12:10,279 --> 00:12:12,213
And nobody can hang with my stuff.

189
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:15,646
You know, I'm just a big, hairy,
American winning machine.

190
00:12:15,851 --> 00:12:18,718
If you ain't first, you're last.
You know what I'm talking about?

191
00:12:18,921 --> 00:12:20,183
That phrase is trademarked...

192
00:12:20,389 --> 00:12:22,880
...not to be used without permission
of Ricky Bobby Inc.

193
00:12:29,932 --> 00:12:33,562
Supper's ready! Come on, y'all!
I've been slaving over this for hours!

194
00:12:35,739 --> 00:12:37,603
Dear Lord baby Jesus...

195
00:12:37,807 --> 00:12:41,141
...or as our brothers
to the south call you, Jesus...

196
00:12:41,611 --> 00:12:47,378
...we thank you so much for this
bountiful harvest of Domino's, KFC...

197
00:12:47,583 --> 00:12:50,610
...and the always delicious Taco Bell.

198
00:12:50,821 --> 00:12:53,585
I just want to take time to say
thank you for my family...

199
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:57,191
...my two beautiful, beautiful,
handsome, striking sons...

200
00:12:57,394 --> 00:12:59,862
...Walker and Texas Ranger...

201
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:02,064
...or T.R., as we call him...

202
00:13:02,265 --> 00:13:05,030
...and of course,
my red-hot smoking wife, Carley...

203
00:13:05,235 --> 00:13:06,998
...who is a stone-cold fox.

204
00:13:07,304 --> 00:13:10,865
Who if you were to rate her ass
on 100, it would easily be a 94.

205
00:13:11,074 --> 00:13:14,408
Also wanna thank you for
my best friend, Cal Naughton Jr...

206
00:13:14,611 --> 00:13:16,408
...who's got my back
no matter what.

207
00:13:17,447 --> 00:13:18,709
Shake and Bake.

208
00:13:18,915 --> 00:13:21,976
Dear Lord baby Jesus, we also
thank you for my wife's father, Chip.

209
00:13:22,186 --> 00:13:24,380
We hope that you can use
your baby Jesus powers...

210
00:13:24,588 --> 00:13:27,319
...to heal him and his horrible leg.

211
00:13:27,525 --> 00:13:31,154
And it smells terrible and
the dogs are always bothering with it.

212
00:13:31,362 --> 00:13:33,023
Dear tiny infant Jesus, we...

213
00:13:33,231 --> 00:13:34,994
Hey, you know, sweetie...

214
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,358
...Jesus did grow up.

215
00:13:37,568 --> 00:13:39,502
You don't always have to
call him "baby."

216
00:13:39,704 --> 00:13:41,399
It's odd and off-putting
to pray to a baby.

217
00:13:41,606 --> 00:13:44,439
Well, I like the Christmas Jesus best
and I'm saying grace.

218
00:13:44,642 --> 00:13:47,304
When you say grace, say it to
grownup Jesus, teenage Jesus...

219
00:13:47,512 --> 00:13:49,002
...bearded Jesus,
whoever you want.

220
00:13:49,213 --> 00:13:50,441
You know what I want?

221
00:13:50,649 --> 00:13:55,176
I want you to do this grace good,
so that God will let us win tomorrow.

222
00:13:55,686 --> 00:13:57,153
Dear tiny Jesus...

223
00:13:57,355 --> 00:14:02,156
...in your golden-fleece diapers, with your
tiny, little, fat, balled-up fists...

224
00:14:02,426 --> 00:14:04,894
...pawing at the air...
- He was a man. He had a beard.

225
00:14:05,096 --> 00:14:07,565
Look, I like the baby version the best,
do you hear me?

226
00:14:07,766 --> 00:14:09,529
I win the races and I get the money.

227
00:14:09,735 --> 00:14:13,226
Ricky, finish the damn grace.

228
00:14:13,437 --> 00:14:16,202
I like to picture Jesus
in a tuxedo T-shirt...

229
00:14:16,408 --> 00:14:19,070
...because it says, like,
"I wanna be formal...

230
00:14:19,278 --> 00:14:21,007
- Right.
...but I'm here to party too."

231
00:14:21,212 --> 00:14:23,613
Because I like to party,
so I like my Jesus to party.

232
00:14:23,815 --> 00:14:27,307
I like to picture Jesus as a ninja
fighting off evil samurai.

233
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:31,421
I like to think of Jesus,
like, with giant eagle's wings.

234
00:14:31,623 --> 00:14:34,683
And singing lead vocals
for Lynyrd Skynyrd...

235
00:14:34,893 --> 00:14:36,485
...with, like, a angel band.

236
00:14:36,695 --> 00:14:39,631
And I'm in the front row,
and I'm hammered drunk.

237
00:14:39,832 --> 00:14:41,423
Hey, Cal?
Why don't you just shut up?

238
00:14:41,633 --> 00:14:43,726
- Yes, ma'am.
- Okay.

239
00:14:43,936 --> 00:14:49,307
Dear 8-pound, 6-ounce,
newborn infant Jesus...

240
00:14:49,808 --> 00:14:51,571
...don't even know a word yet...

241
00:14:51,777 --> 00:14:55,737
...just a little infant and so cuddly,
but still omnipotent...

242
00:14:55,949 --> 00:15:00,544
...we just thank you for all the races
I've won and the 21.2 million dollars...

243
00:15:02,822 --> 00:15:04,289
Love that money!

244
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:06,958
- That I have accrued
over this past season.

245
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:09,253
Also, due to a binding
endorsement contract...

246
00:15:09,462 --> 00:15:11,953
...that stipulates I mention
Powerade at each grace...

247
00:15:12,165 --> 00:15:14,395
...I just wanna say that
Powerade is delicious...

248
00:15:14,601 --> 00:15:16,762
...and it cools you off
on a hot summer day.

249
00:15:16,971 --> 00:15:22,670
And we look forward to Powerade's
release of Mystic Mountain Blueberry.

250
00:15:22,875 --> 00:15:26,209
Thank you for all your power
and your grace, dear baby God. Amen.

251
00:15:26,413 --> 00:15:27,607
- Amen.
- Amen.

252
00:15:27,814 --> 00:15:29,042
Let's dig in!

253
00:15:29,249 --> 00:15:32,241
That was a hell of a grace, man.
You nailed that like a split hog!

254
00:15:32,452 --> 00:15:34,216
I'm not gonna lie to you, it felt good.

255
00:15:34,421 --> 00:15:36,116
Dad, you made that grace your bitch.

256
00:15:36,323 --> 00:15:38,517
Hey, boys, I wanna see
some napkins in the lap.

257
00:15:38,858 --> 00:15:40,155
Boys, how was school today?

258
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:43,558
I threw a bunch of Grandpa Chip's
war medals off the bridge.

259
00:15:44,265 --> 00:15:47,028
Sounds like a good day.
Texas Ranger, how about you?

260
00:15:47,233 --> 00:15:50,431
Well, the teacher asked me what
was the capital of North Carolina.

261
00:15:50,738 --> 00:15:52,501
I said, "Washington, D.C."

262
00:15:52,706 --> 00:15:53,673
- Bingo.
- Nice.

263
00:15:53,874 --> 00:15:58,038
She said, "No, you're wrong."
I said, "You got a lumpy butt."

264
00:15:58,245 --> 00:16:01,373
She got mad at me and yelled at me
and I pissed in my pants.

265
00:16:01,582 --> 00:16:04,381
And I never did change
my pee pants all day.

266
00:16:04,586 --> 00:16:06,678
I'm still sitting in my dirty pee pants.

267
00:16:06,887 --> 00:16:10,152
I wet my bed until I was 19.
There's no shame in that.

268
00:16:10,557 --> 00:16:14,790
I get emotional because
you guys are working so hard.

269
00:16:15,396 --> 00:16:17,956
I'm just so proud of you.
You remind me of me...

270
00:16:18,165 --> 00:16:19,793
...precocious and full of wonderment.

271
00:16:20,001 --> 00:16:21,901
Tell you what, Ricky,
you are truly blessed.

272
00:16:22,103 --> 00:16:24,401
- These two are two in a million.
- I am.

273
00:16:24,606 --> 00:16:26,505
Just like Carley's tatas.

274
00:16:26,707 --> 00:16:28,972
You won't find another rack like that,
I guarantee.

275
00:16:29,177 --> 00:16:30,838
Thank you, Cal.

276
00:16:31,046 --> 00:16:32,479
That's real sweet of you, Cal.

277
00:16:32,681 --> 00:16:35,616
That's real nice. That's one of
the nicest things you've ever said.

278
00:16:35,817 --> 00:16:38,285
- Well, I mean it.
- Stop, you're gonna make me cry.

279
00:16:38,486 --> 00:16:40,181
It comes from my heart, that's why.

280
00:16:40,755 --> 00:16:42,586
I can't hold my tongue.

281
00:16:42,791 --> 00:16:45,988
These kids are my grandchildren,
and you are raising them wrong.

282
00:16:46,194 --> 00:16:47,422
They are terrible boys.

283
00:16:47,629 --> 00:16:50,257
Shut up, Chip,
or I'll go ape-shit on your ass!

284
00:16:50,465 --> 00:16:52,991
I'm gonna scissor-kick you
in the back of the head.

285
00:16:53,202 --> 00:16:55,101
- Yeah!
- Yeah. Turn up the heat.

286
00:16:55,303 --> 00:16:56,861
Go on and get some, boys.

287
00:16:57,072 --> 00:16:59,371
I'm 10 years old,
but I'll beat your ass.

288
00:16:59,575 --> 00:17:02,100
Chip, I'm gonna come at you
like a spider monkey.

289
00:17:02,311 --> 00:17:04,005
Like a spider monkey! Go on.

290
00:17:04,212 --> 00:17:05,338
Chip, you brought this on.

291
00:17:05,547 --> 00:17:07,413
The greatest generation, my ass.

292
00:17:07,616 --> 00:17:09,174
Tom Brokaw is a punk.

293
00:17:09,385 --> 00:17:10,374
What is wrong with you?

294
00:17:10,586 --> 00:17:12,815
Chip, I'm all jacked up
on Mountain Dew.

295
00:17:13,722 --> 00:17:14,712
I love that.

296
00:17:14,924 --> 00:17:18,382
You gonna let your sons talk to their
grandfather like that? I'm their elder.

297
00:17:18,594 --> 00:17:21,620
I sure as hell am, Chip.
I love the way they're talking to you.

298
00:17:21,830 --> 00:17:24,425
They're winners.
Winners get to do what they want.

299
00:17:24,633 --> 00:17:26,157
Hell, you're just a bag of bones.

300
00:17:26,369 --> 00:17:29,133
Only thing you ever done with your life
is make a hot daughter.

301
00:17:29,338 --> 00:17:31,307
That's it. That is it!

302
00:17:31,507 --> 00:17:32,735
We wanted us some wussies...

303
00:17:32,942 --> 00:17:35,672
...we would've named them Dr. Quinn
and Medicine Woman, okay?

304
00:17:35,878 --> 00:17:37,937
I work too hard for your bull, Chip.

305
00:17:38,147 --> 00:17:39,945
Come here.
You make me hot. Come here.

306
00:17:40,983 --> 00:17:42,348
Everyone just keep eating.

307
00:17:42,551 --> 00:17:45,111
- It's on.
- Come here. Come here.

308
00:17:47,391 --> 00:17:48,983
All right.

309
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,624
I'll hold your hair.

310
00:18:03,974 --> 00:18:05,464
- Hey, Stephen.
- Hey, Ricky.

311
00:18:05,675 --> 00:18:07,609
Got those two tickets
for my special friend?

312
00:18:07,811 --> 00:18:11,542
Yeah, sure do. You know I do, Ricky.
Got them right here, buddy.

313
00:18:11,748 --> 00:18:13,841
Great. Hey,
how's your mama's hip?

314
00:18:14,084 --> 00:18:16,109
She's gonna be all right,
thank you for asking.

315
00:18:16,319 --> 00:18:18,345
- Appreciate it. Hey, good luck today.
- Thanks.

316
00:18:18,556 --> 00:18:20,955
That's the saddest thing
I've ever seen in my life.

317
00:18:21,158 --> 00:18:23,888
That boy leaves two tickets
for his daddy at every race...

318
00:18:24,094 --> 00:18:25,357
...and he never shows up.

319
00:18:25,563 --> 00:18:27,292
That's a shame.

320
00:18:27,498 --> 00:18:30,591
The human heart is such a mystery.

321
00:18:31,802 --> 00:18:34,033
- Let's sell these bitches, huh?
- Hell, yeah.

322
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:37,036
- Beer money, huh?
- There you go. Yes.

323
00:18:38,408 --> 00:18:40,740
As the laps wind down,
Jamie McMurray is the leader,

324
00:18:40,944 --> 00:18:43,971
Cal Naughton in second.
Ricky Bobby in third.

325
00:18:44,182 --> 00:18:46,742
What's up, Cal? You ready
for a little Shake-and-Bake-age?

326
00:18:46,951 --> 00:18:49,749
- Hey, buddy.
- Naughton Jr, is letting Ricky Bobby

327
00:18:49,954 --> 00:18:53,549
...draft up to him to make
that slingshot move past McMurray.

328
00:18:53,758 --> 00:18:56,249
Can you believe that he would do that
for his teammate?

329
00:18:56,461 --> 00:18:58,088
Set him up that way?

330
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:01,255
Slingshot, engage.

331
00:19:03,468 --> 00:19:05,334
And there goes Ricky Bobby
on the outside!

332
00:19:05,537 --> 00:19:06,696
That's how we do it.

333
00:19:06,904 --> 00:19:09,338
Makes his move,
Naughton's giving him plenty of room,

334
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:12,134
What in the hell is he doing, guys?
Get him off of me.

335
00:19:12,343 --> 00:19:14,574
They touch! They spin!

336
00:19:15,147 --> 00:19:16,807
Snap!

337
00:19:18,382 --> 00:19:19,781
Come on, man!

338
00:19:23,956 --> 00:19:25,855
See you, wouldn't wanna be you.

339
00:19:36,902 --> 00:19:40,099
Look at that! Ricky Bobby's gonna
try to win the race in reverse.

340
00:19:40,305 --> 00:19:42,000
Man, he wants this win bad!

341
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:45,877
Ricky Bobby wins it in reverse!

342
00:19:46,078 --> 00:19:47,909
Unbelievable!
I love that! That is cool!

343
00:19:48,113 --> 00:19:53,051
Jamie, losing's never fun, but here's
something to pick your spirits up.

344
00:19:53,253 --> 00:19:55,880
It's real nice.
I got it at Target. It's on sale.

345
00:20:01,528 --> 00:20:03,120
Yeah!

346
00:20:09,035 --> 00:20:12,163
- That's it. Another one. Another one.
- All right, man. We did it!

347
00:20:12,372 --> 00:20:15,864
I don't wanna be raining on
your parade, but I gotta tell you...

348
00:20:16,075 --> 00:20:20,136
...that was some of the dumbest driving
I have ever seen in my life.

349
00:20:20,346 --> 00:20:22,211
- Thank you.
- And I know you won the race...

350
00:20:22,415 --> 00:20:23,973
...but you're not gonna live forever.

351
00:20:24,183 --> 00:20:26,981
I'm not stupid, Lucius.
No one lives forever. No one.

352
00:20:27,186 --> 00:20:31,419
But with advances in modern science
and my high level of income...

353
00:20:31,625 --> 00:20:35,025
...I mean, it's not crazy to think
I can't live to be 245, maybe 300.

354
00:20:35,228 --> 00:20:38,720
I just read in the newspaper they
put a pig heart in some Russian guy.

355
00:20:38,933 --> 00:20:41,197
Know what...? I mean,
do you know what that means?

356
00:20:41,402 --> 00:20:43,995
No, I don't know what that means.
I guess, longer life.

357
00:20:44,203 --> 00:20:46,034
- Well, no, he didn't live.
- He didn't live?

358
00:20:46,239 --> 00:20:48,868
No. It's just exciting
that we're trying things like that.

359
00:20:49,243 --> 00:20:51,733
- Ricky?
- Hey, Mr. Dennit.

360
00:20:51,945 --> 00:20:53,970
- Cheers.
- Yeah.

361
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:56,479
- She already wasted?
- Celebrating.

362
00:20:56,684 --> 00:20:58,914
She's celebrating.
You feel pretty good today, huh?

363
00:20:59,119 --> 00:21:01,086
Look, Ricky,
early word out of NASCAR...

364
00:21:01,287 --> 00:21:04,018
...is your little obscene gesture's
gonna cost you 100 points.

365
00:21:04,224 --> 00:21:06,624
You know how much that costs us
in sponsorship dollars?

366
00:21:06,827 --> 00:21:08,556
With all due respect, Mr. Dennit...

367
00:21:08,762 --> 00:21:13,722
...I had no idea you had experimental
surgery to have your balls removed.

368
00:21:13,934 --> 00:21:15,925
What did you say?
What was that?

369
00:21:16,136 --> 00:21:17,967
Well, what?
I said, "With all due respect."

370
00:21:18,173 --> 00:21:20,902
That doesn't mean you get to say
whatever you wanna say to me.

371
00:21:21,108 --> 00:21:22,769
- It sure as heck does.
- No, it doesn't.

372
00:21:22,977 --> 00:21:24,638
It's in the Geneva Convention.
Look it up.

373
00:21:24,845 --> 00:21:26,973
I remember your daddy
used to love it.

374
00:21:27,182 --> 00:21:31,845
- This is not my dad... This is my team...
- Used to love it when I used to win.

375
00:21:32,052 --> 00:21:34,453
Now, I suggest you and your wife,
Mrs. Jim Beam...

376
00:21:34,656 --> 00:21:36,783
...you guys go take a chill pill.
Enjoy the win!

377
00:21:36,992 --> 00:21:38,720
- Come on, man!
- Yeah, Ricky. Okay.

378
00:21:38,926 --> 00:21:40,621
Baby, photo op, photo op.
Come on.

379
00:21:40,828 --> 00:21:42,558
Come on, number one.

380
00:21:43,331 --> 00:21:45,356
Hold my hand, baby.

381
00:21:53,441 --> 00:21:56,501
I'll tell you what, though, guys,
that was a hell of a race today.

382
00:21:56,711 --> 00:21:59,612
- Shake and Bake in full effect.
- It's always been like that.

383
00:22:01,349 --> 00:22:03,408
Me and Ricky,
since we were little kids, man.

384
00:22:03,618 --> 00:22:06,850
We go together like Chinese food
and chocolate pudding. Let's face it.

385
00:22:07,056 --> 00:22:09,751
Yeah, but those are two things
that don't really go together.

386
00:22:09,958 --> 00:22:12,358
We go together
like cocaine and waffles.

387
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:15,291
No, like, for instance,
if I say peanut butter and...

388
00:22:15,931 --> 00:22:17,830
- Ladies, right?
- Yep.

389
00:22:18,033 --> 00:22:19,193
- No, jelly.
- Am I right?

390
00:22:19,401 --> 00:22:21,632
- Jelly?
- You like to put jelly on a lady?

391
00:22:21,837 --> 00:22:24,499
I'm gonna settle this thing.
Let's just get ourselves...

392
00:22:24,707 --> 00:22:28,734
...a whole mess of cocktails,
get drunk and work this thing out.

393
00:22:28,944 --> 00:22:30,605
- Work this thing out.
- That's right.

394
00:22:31,414 --> 00:22:35,350
So I was talking to Nana on Saturday,
and her birthday's coming up...

395
00:22:35,551 --> 00:22:37,849
...but I don't know what to get her.
She's gonna be 88.

396
00:22:38,054 --> 00:22:39,749
Get her a coffin.

397
00:22:45,528 --> 00:22:49,464
Hey, Cal, I'm sorry
about wrecking you today.

398
00:22:49,665 --> 00:22:53,500
- I mean, but that was for the team.
- No, that's cool. That's cool, I know.

399
00:22:53,704 --> 00:22:56,194
I was thinking, though, one time...

400
00:22:56,405 --> 00:23:01,002
...it would be really awesome if, like,
you could slingshot me in for a win.

401
00:23:01,211 --> 00:23:03,805
Yeah, but... Okay, but if you won...

402
00:23:04,014 --> 00:23:06,311
...how am I gonna win?
- Yeah.

403
00:23:06,515 --> 00:23:09,076
- Think about it.
- No, I was thinking about it.

404
00:23:09,286 --> 00:23:11,345
I mean, it's not like
you're finishing 18th.

405
00:23:11,555 --> 00:23:14,614
- There's nothing wrong with silver.
- Nothing wrong with silver at all.

406
00:23:14,824 --> 00:23:17,089
I'm just kidding you, man.
I don't wanna win.

407
00:23:19,062 --> 00:23:20,893
I'll just bury it down inside.

408
00:23:21,098 --> 00:23:23,828
Bury it deep down in there,
and never bring it up again.

409
00:23:24,034 --> 00:23:26,195
It's painful, and I love you!

410
00:23:26,403 --> 00:23:28,234
Get her a gigolo.

411
00:23:28,438 --> 00:23:31,100
- What?
- A guy to have sex with her.

412
00:23:31,308 --> 00:23:33,208
No, she's gonna be 88 and...

413
00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:36,004
You don't stop liking sex
when you're old.

414
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:40,578
Well, I was thinking
more along the line of...

415
00:23:40,785 --> 00:23:45,187
- Like, she likes afghans and quilts.
- She's probably got a million of those.

416
00:23:45,388 --> 00:23:48,586
How many dudes does she have
coming over to have sex with her?

417
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,826
- None.
- Exactly.

418
00:23:52,129 --> 00:23:54,120
Be thoughtful, Glenn.

419
00:23:55,566 --> 00:23:57,033
Don't stop.

420
00:24:03,941 --> 00:24:04,930
What is that?

421
00:24:05,143 --> 00:24:07,509
Someone made a tape of
something dying or something.

422
00:24:07,745 --> 00:24:09,713
Hey, turn that crap off.
What's going on?

423
00:24:09,914 --> 00:24:11,814
I want this music out of my head.

424
00:24:12,016 --> 00:24:13,483
Hey, turn that off!

425
00:24:14,252 --> 00:24:15,981
Turn that off right now!

426
00:24:21,659 --> 00:24:24,184
Why did you stop the jazz music?

427
00:24:25,963 --> 00:24:28,194
Was it not pleasant for you?

428
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,266
No one plays jazz here
at The Pit Stop, okay?

429
00:24:31,469 --> 00:24:33,994
So why is the song on the jukebox?

430
00:24:34,205 --> 00:24:37,334
We keep it on there
for profiling purposes.

431
00:24:37,543 --> 00:24:40,636
We also got
the Pet Shop Boys and Seal.

432
00:24:41,345 --> 00:24:44,281
My name is Jean Girard...

433
00:24:44,616 --> 00:24:48,074
...and I am a racing-car driver
just like you...

434
00:24:48,287 --> 00:24:51,279
...except I am from Formula Un.

435
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:55,858
I am the greatest one
in the whole world.

436
00:24:56,061 --> 00:25:01,590
I have been following your career
with great interest, Monsieur Bobby.

437
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:04,166
I can't understand a word
you've said the whole time.

438
00:25:04,369 --> 00:25:06,167
Did you eat peanut butter
or something?

439
00:25:06,372 --> 00:25:09,340
You sound like a dog with peanut butter
on the roof of your mouth.

440
00:25:09,541 --> 00:25:13,102
I think what you are hearing
is my accent.

441
00:25:13,312 --> 00:25:15,838
I am French.

442
00:25:16,049 --> 00:25:17,640
You say you're French?

443
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:21,646
We? No, we are not French.

444
00:25:22,021 --> 00:25:24,956
We're American,
because you're in America, okay?

445
00:25:25,158 --> 00:25:26,682
Greatest country on the planet.

446
00:25:26,892 --> 00:25:28,689
Well, what have you
given the world...

447
00:25:28,894 --> 00:25:33,025
...apart from George Bush, Cheerios,
and the ThighMaster?

448
00:25:33,266 --> 00:25:35,097
- Chinese food?
- Chinese food.

449
00:25:35,301 --> 00:25:36,528
That's from China.

450
00:25:36,735 --> 00:25:38,863
- Pizza.
- Italy.

451
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:41,597
- Chimichanga.
- Mexican.

452
00:25:41,808 --> 00:25:44,368
Really, smarty-pants?
What did French land give us?

453
00:25:44,577 --> 00:25:48,809
We invented democracy,
existentialism...

454
00:25:49,015 --> 00:25:50,175
...and the blowjob.

455
00:25:51,217 --> 00:25:53,277
- Those are three pretty good things.
- Hey.

456
00:25:53,487 --> 00:25:55,045
Well, that last one's pretty cool.

457
00:25:56,222 --> 00:25:59,988
You know, the 69 with
the head near the... That bit.

458
00:26:00,193 --> 00:26:01,354
We came up with it.

459
00:26:01,562 --> 00:26:03,996
We created the missionary position.

460
00:26:04,198 --> 00:26:07,792
- You're welcome.
- Ricky Bobby...

461
00:26:08,001 --> 00:26:11,028
...I have come here to defeat you.

462
00:26:11,238 --> 00:26:14,036
Oh, well, there's strikes two and three
right there.

463
00:26:14,674 --> 00:26:16,266
Did you hear what he just said?

464
00:26:17,511 --> 00:26:19,775
Well, welcome to America, amigo.

465
00:26:25,019 --> 00:26:27,852
You are fast, Ricky Bobby...

466
00:26:28,589 --> 00:26:30,250
...but I am faster.

467
00:26:30,457 --> 00:26:34,154
All right, you let go of me,
you Formula One jazz nutjob!

468
00:26:34,361 --> 00:26:36,886
Like the frightened baby chipmunk...

469
00:26:37,097 --> 00:26:39,896
...you are scared by anything
that is different.

470
00:26:40,101 --> 00:26:42,399
I will let you go, Ricky...

471
00:26:42,604 --> 00:26:46,835
...but first I want you to say:

472
00:26:48,343 --> 00:26:51,779
"I love crepes."

473
00:26:52,446 --> 00:26:55,438
Don't you say it, Ricky.
These colors don't run.

474
00:26:55,650 --> 00:26:57,277
- I'm not gonna say it.
- Good.

475
00:26:57,485 --> 00:26:59,646
Hey, look, Frenchy,
I thought about it.

476
00:26:59,854 --> 00:27:02,083
So why don't you go ahead
and break my arm?

477
00:27:02,289 --> 00:27:05,350
I do not want to break your arm,
Monsieur Bobby...

478
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:07,152
...but I am a man of my word.

479
00:27:07,362 --> 00:27:09,421
Here's the deal.
He's not gonna break it...

480
00:27:09,631 --> 00:27:12,031
...because I'm gonna slip
out of it right now. Houdini.

481
00:27:12,233 --> 00:27:13,495
Get down, you little pancake.

482
00:27:13,702 --> 00:27:15,260
Someone get me a beer
while I'm here.

483
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:17,665
But you have forced me to do this.

484
00:27:17,872 --> 00:27:20,603
You are now mocking me
and making me look ridiculous.

485
00:27:20,810 --> 00:27:22,436
Just say, "I love crepes."

486
00:27:22,644 --> 00:27:26,546
You know, just to put this in there, I had
a whole mess of crepes this morning.

487
00:27:26,748 --> 00:27:28,512
They're like pancakes,
maybe even better.

488
00:27:28,718 --> 00:27:31,447
- Are they the really thin pancakes?
- Yeah.

489
00:27:31,653 --> 00:27:34,645
They are the really thin pancakes.
It's just a French word for them.

490
00:27:34,857 --> 00:27:37,348
- My God, I love those.
- Put any syrups you want on them.

491
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:40,392
- I'm saying, think about it.
- They come with cheese sometimes?

492
00:27:40,595 --> 00:27:42,324
Yes, of course,
a fromage-crepe.

493
00:27:42,564 --> 00:27:44,590
Well, why didn't someone
yell that right away?

494
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,392
You know what's in
the crepe suzette?

495
00:27:46,602 --> 00:27:48,695
- Oh, I love the crepe suzette.
- With the sugar...

496
00:27:48,904 --> 00:27:51,600
...and lemon juice, Grand Marnier.
- Sugar and lemon juice.

497
00:27:51,841 --> 00:27:54,173
I wish I could crawl into
one of those right now.

498
00:27:54,377 --> 00:27:58,040
- I'd eat my way out from the inside.
- They are tasty.

499
00:27:58,247 --> 00:28:00,738
Either way this goes, could we
get some after we're done?

500
00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:03,612
- Absolutely. We're gonna do that.
- So, what if you just said:

501
00:28:03,819 --> 00:28:08,052
"I love really thin pancakes"?
That is a fair compromise, no?

502
00:28:08,258 --> 00:28:10,384
- That is a fair compromise.
- Very fair, actually.

503
00:28:10,593 --> 00:28:13,289
No! Because then everyone
would know I really meant crepes.

504
00:28:13,496 --> 00:28:15,021
That's a pretty good compromise.

505
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:18,132
Why do you want me
to break your arm so badly?

506
00:28:18,334 --> 00:28:21,428
You don't understand
because you don't understand liberty.

507
00:28:21,637 --> 00:28:23,469
You don't understand freedom.

508
00:28:23,673 --> 00:28:27,370
So you put a crack in my arm
like the crack in the Liberty Bell.

509
00:28:27,810 --> 00:28:30,609
Hey. This is just
between you and me, okay?

510
00:28:30,814 --> 00:28:32,975
I mean, forget all these other guys.

511
00:28:33,183 --> 00:28:35,913
But he did give you a pretty
decent out. But it's your call.

512
00:28:36,119 --> 00:28:37,814
What do you think?

513
00:28:38,455 --> 00:28:40,389
- Don't say it.
- Yeah. I'm not gonna say it.

514
00:28:40,624 --> 00:28:42,057
Break it, Pepe Le Pew.

515
00:28:42,459 --> 00:28:43,687
As you wish.

516
00:28:46,863 --> 00:28:51,027
- He actually did it!
- All right. You did it. Back off.

517
00:28:51,268 --> 00:28:53,065
- I didn't say it!
- No, you did not.

518
00:28:53,271 --> 00:28:56,671
Your injury is one
of ignorance and pride.

519
00:28:58,942 --> 00:29:01,468
Hold it right there,
Mr. Fancy Pants Foreigner.

520
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:03,112
You just broke my bro's arm.

521
00:29:03,314 --> 00:29:04,906
Now you're about to get Tasered.

522
00:29:06,283 --> 00:29:09,048
- Say hello to Dr. Watts.
- Get him, Cal.

523
00:29:11,222 --> 00:29:13,349
I need you all to step away...

524
00:29:13,558 --> 00:29:14,889
...from my driver.

525
00:29:15,092 --> 00:29:18,028
The hell you talking about, "my driver"?
What are you doing with a gun?

526
00:29:18,229 --> 00:29:20,720
Don't you worry about my gun, Ricky.

527
00:29:20,932 --> 00:29:23,833
Jean Girard is my new boy
at Dennit Racing. He's here to win us...

528
00:29:24,035 --> 00:29:26,765
...an overall-points championship,
something you apparently...

529
00:29:26,971 --> 00:29:29,531
...have no interest in.
He's gonna usher in a new era.

530
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:31,435
Mr. Dennit, with all due respect...

531
00:29:31,642 --> 00:29:33,907
And remember,
I'm saying, "with all due respect."

532
00:29:34,112 --> 00:29:38,446
- That idea ain't worth a velvet painting
of a whale and a dolphin getting it on.

533
00:29:38,816 --> 00:29:41,843
That's good. That's good fun.
That's good fun, Ricky...

534
00:29:42,054 --> 00:29:44,988
...but that doesn't bother me anymore
because Jean is the future...

535
00:29:45,189 --> 00:29:46,588
...Ricky, the past.

536
00:29:46,791 --> 00:29:48,987
So, Jean, introduce me
to your new teammates.

537
00:29:49,661 --> 00:29:53,824
Everybody,
this is my husband, Gregory.

538
00:29:54,031 --> 00:29:55,498
What?

539
00:29:56,535 --> 00:29:58,264
See you at the track.

540
00:29:58,871 --> 00:30:00,338
Did he just say "husband"?

541
00:30:00,539 --> 00:30:04,976
Sweet Lord. Dennit hired a gay
Frenchman as your teammate.

542
00:30:05,177 --> 00:30:07,475
The room's starting to spin real fast.

543
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:11,078
Because of gayness.

544
00:30:12,751 --> 00:30:16,050
- Cal, I love you.
- Ricky? Ricky! Oh, God!

545
00:30:25,264 --> 00:30:30,032
Fans and NASCAR, everyone is talking
about this new driver, Jean Girard.

546
00:30:30,236 --> 00:30:33,693
Let's find out a little bit more about him
from our reporter, Davey Wesling.

547
00:30:33,906 --> 00:30:37,638
Talented, Eccentric, Dominating,

548
00:30:37,844 --> 00:30:41,176
These are the words
that define Jean Girard,

549
00:30:41,914 --> 00:30:46,284
Before each race, Jean Girard spends
time with his world-class horses

550
00:30:46,486 --> 00:30:48,511
who are also gay,

551
00:30:48,721 --> 00:30:51,189
Jean's days are filled
with sun-drenched walks

552
00:30:51,391 --> 00:30:53,586
with his beloved husband, Gregory,

553
00:30:54,594 --> 00:30:57,290
Though Gregory is
no stay-at-home spouse,

554
00:30:57,497 --> 00:31:00,432
He's a world-class trainer
of German shepherds,

555
00:31:00,633 --> 00:31:02,897
Rolfe, the Nazi boyfriend.
Up on top!

556
00:31:05,071 --> 00:31:07,370
Very nice. Very nice.

557
00:31:07,975 --> 00:31:11,705
Only time will tell if Jean's foray
into NAS CAR

558
00:31:11,911 --> 00:31:13,970
will end up in Victory Lane,

559
00:31:34,535 --> 00:31:36,867
Well, kiss my ass on Sunday.

560
00:31:37,538 --> 00:31:40,029
- Lucius, what the hell is going on?
- The man can drive.

561
00:31:40,274 --> 00:31:42,071
And check out his crew chief
over there.

562
00:31:42,276 --> 00:31:44,506
Won the Nobel Prize
for physics back in '93.

563
00:31:44,712 --> 00:31:47,681
Ladies and gentlemen,
that is a new track record,

564
00:31:47,881 --> 00:31:51,442
As it stands now, Jean Girard is sitting
on the pole, which is, of course

565
00:31:51,652 --> 00:31:53,883
a statement of fact
and in no way a comment

566
00:31:54,089 --> 00:31:55,920
on the driver's sexual orientation,

567
00:31:56,124 --> 00:31:58,887
Put a smile on your face?
That's the future of Dennit Racing.

568
00:31:59,093 --> 00:32:01,459
- That make you happy?
- I'm just thrilled, Mr. Dennit.

569
00:32:01,663 --> 00:32:03,756
I love seeing some French guy
break my record...

570
00:32:03,965 --> 00:32:06,797
...while I got my arm wrapped up
like a fricking gordita.

571
00:32:07,001 --> 00:32:08,559
Hello, Ricky Bobby.

572
00:32:09,236 --> 00:32:13,970
What happened last week was
very regrettable and unfortunate...

573
00:32:14,909 --> 00:32:17,810
...and, as a gesture, I would like to...

574
00:32:18,013 --> 00:32:19,446
...sign your cast, please.

575
00:32:19,648 --> 00:32:22,276
Hell, you know what,
get my car off the trailer, guys.

576
00:32:22,484 --> 00:32:24,111
Baby! That's my baby!

577
00:32:24,319 --> 00:32:27,482
Hold on, Ricky. Ricky, Ricky, Rick.
What are you talking about?

578
00:32:27,689 --> 00:32:31,284
Look. I wanna drive. My arm's fine.
So let's get the car off the trailer.

579
00:32:31,493 --> 00:32:33,587
Don't look at me.
Get it off the trailer!

580
00:32:33,796 --> 00:32:37,993
Even with a healthy arm, you don't
have a chance against Jean Girard.

581
00:32:38,199 --> 00:32:40,998
All right, fellas. You heard the man.
Get the car off. Let's go.

582
00:32:41,203 --> 00:32:42,534
You guys heard it.

583
00:32:43,339 --> 00:32:46,398
- What's going on?
- Soon you will know what it is like...

584
00:32:46,608 --> 00:32:51,171
...to be defeated by the hands of
somebody who is truly better than you.

585
00:32:52,948 --> 00:32:56,782
As William Blake wrote,
"The cut worm forgives the plow."

586
00:32:56,986 --> 00:32:59,853
Well, let me just quote the late,
great Colonel Sanders...

587
00:33:00,056 --> 00:33:03,616
...who said,
"I'm too drunk to taste this chicken."

588
00:33:03,825 --> 00:33:05,691
What's that got to do with this?

589
00:33:05,895 --> 00:33:09,592
I got a message for all of them.
Ready? Shake and Bake!

590
00:33:09,799 --> 00:33:13,200
What does that do? Does that
blow your mind? That just happened!

591
00:33:13,402 --> 00:33:16,701
What is that, a catch phrase
or is that epilepsy?

592
00:33:16,906 --> 00:33:19,431
- Shake and Bake. Shake and Bake.
- What?

593
00:33:19,642 --> 00:33:24,341
Listen, you better be careful because
tomorrow you're going to get beaten.

594
00:33:24,547 --> 00:33:26,640
Beaten real bad, cowboy.

595
00:33:26,849 --> 00:33:28,215
- Really?
- Yes!

596
00:33:28,418 --> 00:33:30,545
- I don't want to know.
- That's news to me.

597
00:33:30,754 --> 00:33:34,018
- Tomorrow you'll be in trouble.
- I'll rip you a new one.

598
00:33:34,490 --> 00:33:37,483
There's going to be a croissant
I'm going to take away.

599
00:33:37,694 --> 00:33:38,888
I play for keeps!

600
00:33:39,563 --> 00:33:42,190
I give you one option,
Monsieur Bobby.

601
00:33:42,398 --> 00:33:45,562
As a sign of humility,
if you kiss me on the lips now...

602
00:33:45,769 --> 00:33:49,364
...I will return to Paris and you will
never see me again in NASCAR.

603
00:33:49,573 --> 00:33:50,971
The answer is never!

604
00:33:51,173 --> 00:33:53,836
- I close my...
- Do you hear me? Never ever!

605
00:33:54,044 --> 00:33:56,740
- Well, yes or no?
- That's sick.

606
00:33:59,650 --> 00:34:02,516
Let me tell you, hold on.
Shake and Bake.

607
00:34:02,719 --> 00:34:03,947
Yeah!

608
00:34:04,154 --> 00:34:05,951
What does that mean?
It makes no sense!

609
00:34:06,156 --> 00:34:07,920
This "Shake and Bake,"
it's nonsense.

610
00:34:08,126 --> 00:34:11,424
- Hey, baby. You guys are so smooth.
- Thanks, darling.

611
00:34:11,628 --> 00:34:14,654
Cal, you could say that 10,000 times
and it still wouldn't be enough.

612
00:34:14,865 --> 00:34:17,061
- It fires me up.
- I love it. Say it one more time.

613
00:34:17,268 --> 00:34:19,235
- Shake and Bake!
- Doesn't that feel good?

614
00:34:19,436 --> 00:34:23,464
Yeah! It rhymes,
they're both verbs. It's awesome.

615
00:34:46,297 --> 00:34:49,027
NAS CAR on Fox welcomes you
to Lowe's Motor Speedway

616
00:34:49,233 --> 00:34:51,724
...where tonight we'll go 500 miles.

617
00:34:52,570 --> 00:34:56,200
The big stories tonight
are at both ends of the grid,

618
00:34:56,408 --> 00:35:00,741
Up front, Larry, the surprising French
Formula One driver, Jean Girard,

619
00:35:01,746 --> 00:35:05,114
And at the opposite end of the grid,
Darrell, Ricky Bobby,

620
00:35:05,317 --> 00:35:08,444
I saw Ricky Bobby last night walking
around with a cast on his arm,

621
00:35:08,653 --> 00:35:11,521
Now, I don't know who he conned
into letting him start this race.

622
00:35:11,723 --> 00:35:13,554
Just keep a camera on him
all night long,

623
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:16,524
I am so excited.

624
00:35:16,727 --> 00:35:19,390
This is a new era
for Dennit Racing, huh?

625
00:35:19,598 --> 00:35:24,433
So serious all the time
about your big race team.

626
00:35:24,636 --> 00:35:28,163
- Who cares?
- But this is my life. This is my life.

627
00:35:28,373 --> 00:35:31,900
You know what? There's only one
good thing about coming to the races...

628
00:35:32,110 --> 00:35:35,910
...and that is
the vibrations from the cars.

629
00:35:36,114 --> 00:35:39,948
Oh, I love when them cars whiz by.

630
00:35:41,588 --> 00:35:43,715
Can feel the motor...

631
00:35:43,923 --> 00:35:46,152
...running up my legs.

632
00:35:48,694 --> 00:35:51,186
Ricky Bobby, who never met
a sponsor he wouldn't push

633
00:35:51,397 --> 00:35:53,388
has a Fig Newton sticker
on his windshield,

634
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:55,430
Think NAS CAR will
black-flag him for that,

635
00:35:55,634 --> 00:35:56,999
He sold the windshield!

636
00:35:57,203 --> 00:36:00,934
This sticker is dangerous and
inconvenient, but I love Fig Newtons.

637
00:36:02,442 --> 00:36:04,500
Ricky Bobby started this race
in the back

638
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:07,077
but he's making no friends
on the way to the front,

639
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:10,943
I'm all about getting to the front tonight,
Lucius. Let's go! Let's move it!

640
00:36:11,150 --> 00:36:13,016
Well, he's driving
like a man possessed,

641
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:17,019
I'm not even sure he realizes how
much damage he's doing to his car,

642
00:36:19,692 --> 00:36:24,220
Hey, Ricky. You know you're driving
like a pissed-off teenager, okay?

643
00:36:24,430 --> 00:36:26,125
Where is that Frenchy?

644
00:36:30,671 --> 00:36:32,331
I got you, Pepe Le Bitch.

645
00:36:33,973 --> 00:36:35,736
Oh, Ricky Bobby.

646
00:36:37,478 --> 00:36:39,503
Hey, it's me, America.

647
00:36:43,683 --> 00:36:45,151
Yeah, I'm here.

648
00:36:45,352 --> 00:36:47,820
You have spilled my macchiato.

649
00:36:49,456 --> 00:36:50,787
Look at Girard in the 55.

650
00:36:50,991 --> 00:36:54,859
He's made that car three lanes wide,
but he's still fast,

651
00:36:55,062 --> 00:36:58,828
No, no, no, my friend.
This way also closed. Not this way.

652
00:37:00,402 --> 00:37:02,528
Lucius, what's he doing?
He's everywhere at once.

653
00:37:02,736 --> 00:37:05,170
Guy's dangerous, Ricky.
He's like a cobra. Back off!

654
00:37:05,372 --> 00:37:07,363
Where's Cal?
I need a little support here!

655
00:37:09,644 --> 00:37:11,110
Tell Ricky I'm on my way.

656
00:37:16,718 --> 00:37:18,242
Damn it!

657
00:37:18,453 --> 00:37:20,147
Hey, Ricky, listen,

658
00:37:20,354 --> 00:37:26,260
Cal blew out his engine.
You have no backup. Back off!

659
00:37:26,461 --> 00:37:29,657
I ain't backing off.
I'm Ricky Bobby, I'm the best there is.

660
00:37:29,863 --> 00:37:32,594
He's too good, Ricky. Lay off!

661
00:37:33,468 --> 00:37:35,459
Bobby's boxed in,
There's nowhere to go there,

662
00:37:38,039 --> 00:37:41,440
He's gonna try the outside move again,
I don't know if it's gonna work,

663
00:37:41,643 --> 00:37:43,270
Come on, Daddy!

664
00:37:43,478 --> 00:37:45,139
Come on, Daddy! Whoop his butt!

665
00:37:45,347 --> 00:37:47,942
Send that weird man
back to Indonesia.

666
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:53,654
- Come on!
- Bobby moves to the outside,

667
00:37:53,855 --> 00:37:55,483
Not a lot of room, He's in the wall!

668
00:37:55,691 --> 00:37:57,920
Bobby is sliding,
slamming into the wall,

669
00:38:04,033 --> 00:38:05,898
He's airborne!

670
00:38:07,802 --> 00:38:10,396
Yep. I'm flying through the air.
This is not good.

671
00:38:10,606 --> 00:38:13,268
- Ricky!
- Cool!

672
00:38:22,685 --> 00:38:24,152
Ricky!

673
00:38:31,227 --> 00:38:32,660
Peaches and cream!

674
00:38:36,165 --> 00:38:38,725
The car comes to rest
in a big cloud of smoke,

675
00:38:38,934 --> 00:38:40,834
Ricky Bobby appears to be okay

676
00:38:41,037 --> 00:38:43,438
but that Wonder Bread car is toast,

677
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:45,335
Fantastic.

678
00:38:45,541 --> 00:38:48,169
Oh, my God! Ricky!

679
00:38:48,778 --> 00:38:51,612
Hakuna matata, bitches.

680
00:38:58,021 --> 00:39:00,990
It's okay, guys, it's just a wreck.
Ricky can handle it.

681
00:39:01,191 --> 00:39:04,489
Now, that's one of the nastiest wrecks
you'll ever see,

682
00:39:04,694 --> 00:39:06,856
Oh, no, no, no.

683
00:39:07,064 --> 00:39:09,032
It's all right. You're safe.

684
00:39:09,232 --> 00:39:11,166
- You're safe.
- We got you. We're here.

685
00:39:11,368 --> 00:39:12,733
I'm on fire.

686
00:39:12,936 --> 00:39:15,166
It's all right.
It's all right, you're not on fire!

687
00:39:15,372 --> 00:39:19,138
- You're lying! I'm on fire!
- There is no fire.

688
00:39:19,342 --> 00:39:21,903
- I'm on fire. I don't wanna die.
- Come back here.

689
00:39:22,113 --> 00:39:25,741
But something looks wrong. I mean,
he's running around like he's on fire.

690
00:39:25,949 --> 00:39:29,647
Oh, my God! Help me!
I don't wanna die! Stop, drop, and roll!

691
00:39:29,854 --> 00:39:33,254
- You're not on fire, Ricky Bobby!
- I'm on fire!

692
00:39:33,457 --> 00:39:34,924
You're not on fire.

693
00:39:35,459 --> 00:39:38,327
But I'm not even sure he even knows
where he's at right now.

694
00:39:38,529 --> 00:39:43,431
This makes us all realize the kind
of pressure these drivers are under,

695
00:39:43,633 --> 00:39:45,101
Mr. Bobby, come on down here.

696
00:39:45,303 --> 00:39:48,932
Help me, Jesus!
Help me, Jewish God!

697
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:50,539
Help me, Allah!

698
00:39:52,175 --> 00:39:53,370
Help me, Tom Cruise!

699
00:39:53,578 --> 00:39:56,172
But how did he get down
to his underwear that fast?

700
00:39:56,380 --> 00:39:59,543
Tom Cruise, use your witchcraft on me
to get the fire off me!

701
00:39:59,751 --> 00:40:01,117
Look, Here, help's coming,

702
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:03,048
- Wait a minute!
- It's Cal Naughton,

703
00:40:04,155 --> 00:40:07,591
Oh, God! Please don't let
the invisible fire burn my friend!

704
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:12,117
I got you!
I got you, man! I'll help you!

705
00:40:12,330 --> 00:40:16,027
He's jumping on Ricky, trying
to put the nonexistent fire out.

706
00:40:16,235 --> 00:40:17,793
Now, that's a teammate right there.

707
00:40:18,003 --> 00:40:19,493
This is going downhill fast,

708
00:40:19,705 --> 00:40:22,639
It would be a great time
to go to commercial break,

709
00:40:23,374 --> 00:40:24,933
Help me, Oprah Winfrey!

710
00:40:26,545 --> 00:40:30,742
You know, Larry, there's good days
in racing, and there's bad days,

711
00:40:30,948 --> 00:40:34,180
Ricky Bobby just had himself
a bad day,

712
00:40:42,528 --> 00:40:44,155
He's suffering from catatonic shock.

713
00:40:44,363 --> 00:40:47,925
His injuries are minor, but right now he
can't deal with the trauma of the wreck.

714
00:40:48,134 --> 00:40:51,227
Golly, this is a hard decision.

715
00:40:51,436 --> 00:40:56,306
But I have thought about it,
and I want the plug pulled.

716
00:40:56,509 --> 00:40:57,908
Yeah.

717
00:40:58,111 --> 00:41:00,340
Ma'am, your husband's not dying.

718
00:41:00,546 --> 00:41:02,844
He's just taking a nap.

719
00:41:03,383 --> 00:41:05,214
- Just look at him.
- No, I'm not lying.

720
00:41:05,418 --> 00:41:07,750
I've never seen him
make that noise. Ever.

721
00:41:09,121 --> 00:41:11,352
Got more plugs in him
than a Circuit City.

722
00:41:11,558 --> 00:41:16,188
Oh, baby.
Mama loves you so much.

723
00:41:16,963 --> 00:41:20,592
Hey, Ricky. It's me, Cal.

724
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:25,100
Just want you to know,
I got your back, bro. No matter what.

725
00:41:25,972 --> 00:41:28,440
There's something
I want to get off my chest...

726
00:41:28,641 --> 00:41:32,475
...and it's about that summer when
you went away to community college.

727
00:41:32,679 --> 00:41:36,207
I got a offer to do Playgirl magazine...

728
00:41:37,116 --> 00:41:38,879
...and I did it.

729
00:41:39,085 --> 00:41:42,282
I did a full spread
for Playgirl magazine.

730
00:41:42,923 --> 00:41:46,756
I mean spread, man.
I pulled my butt apart and stuff...

731
00:41:47,327 --> 00:41:51,196
...and I was totally nude,
and it was weird.

732
00:41:51,398 --> 00:41:53,127
You probably didn't hear about it...

733
00:41:53,334 --> 00:41:55,665
...because I went under the name
of Mike Honcho.

734
00:41:55,869 --> 00:41:57,564
But I just wanted you to know that.

735
00:41:57,770 --> 00:42:01,571
If you could hear me,
if it got into your brain somehow...

736
00:42:01,775 --> 00:42:03,936
...that I spread my butt cheeks
as Mike Honcho.

737
00:42:04,144 --> 00:42:07,011
"Are you there, God?
It's me, Margaret.

738
00:42:07,214 --> 00:42:11,116
Gretchen, my friend, got her period.
I'm so jealous, God.

739
00:42:11,318 --> 00:42:14,254
I hate myself for being so jealous,
but I am.

740
00:42:14,456 --> 00:42:16,650
I wish you'd help me just a little.

741
00:42:16,857 --> 00:42:21,317
Nancy's sure she's going to
get it soon too. And if I'm last..."

742
00:42:21,796 --> 00:42:24,628
Hey, Ricky. Ricky!

743
00:42:24,965 --> 00:42:26,830
Come on, man, wake up.

744
00:42:27,034 --> 00:42:28,763
Are you faking it?

745
00:42:31,673 --> 00:42:35,403
Are you faking it? Fake it!

746
00:42:40,015 --> 00:42:43,575
I don't know how much longer
I can take seeing you like this.

747
00:42:44,251 --> 00:42:48,120
I am not gonna let you die here...

748
00:42:48,323 --> 00:42:50,223
...like some kind of vegetable.

749
00:42:50,625 --> 00:42:52,785
I'm gonna put an end to this
right now.

750
00:42:52,993 --> 00:42:54,655
Get all this crap off you.

751
00:42:54,863 --> 00:42:56,922
You don't need any of this crap.

752
00:42:59,768 --> 00:43:02,259
This is it. This is how it ends.

753
00:43:02,470 --> 00:43:03,994
This is how Shake and Bake ends.

754
00:43:04,606 --> 00:43:06,870
It's shadow time, buddy.

755
00:43:09,612 --> 00:43:11,943
It's time to go home to Jesus.

756
00:43:12,814 --> 00:43:14,543
Goodbye, buddy.

757
00:43:19,055 --> 00:43:20,522
Oh, wow, you definitely...

758
00:43:20,723 --> 00:43:23,156
You definitely
still got some fight in you.

759
00:43:26,095 --> 00:43:27,756
Okay, maybe we give this
another day.

760
00:43:28,631 --> 00:43:31,622
Middle. I'll go up to the middle.
Let's play some defense!

761
00:43:33,536 --> 00:43:36,596
I just wanna say thanks, doc,
for taking care of our boy here.

762
00:43:36,806 --> 00:43:39,934
- Oh, shit.
- That's a foul! That's a foul!

763
00:43:40,142 --> 00:43:41,507
Doc, give it to me straight.

764
00:43:41,711 --> 00:43:44,009
Is he ever gonna be able
to walk again?

765
00:43:44,213 --> 00:43:47,080
Oh, I'm sorry, I thought someone
had told you. He's fine.

766
00:43:47,283 --> 00:43:48,979
He found that wheelchair
in the hallway.

767
00:43:49,186 --> 00:43:52,052
His paralysis is
entirely psychosomatic.

768
00:43:52,254 --> 00:43:55,883
But we all need to go along with this,
because he's in a delicate state.

769
00:43:56,093 --> 00:43:59,619
So when you say psychosomatic,
you mean, like...

770
00:43:59,829 --> 00:44:02,229
...he could start a fire
with his thoughts?

771
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:04,423
No, not at all.
It means it's all in his mind.

772
00:44:04,634 --> 00:44:08,297
I'm saying, sometimes you get a knock
on the head, you get special powers.

773
00:44:08,505 --> 00:44:10,904
It happens all the time.
Read a comic book, okay?

774
00:44:11,107 --> 00:44:12,541
Everyone's real friendly.

775
00:44:12,743 --> 00:44:15,735
It doesn't hurt being Ricky Bobby.
I'm not gonna lie to you.

776
00:44:15,946 --> 00:44:17,573
So how's the physical therapy going?

777
00:44:17,781 --> 00:44:20,648
Oh, I gave that up.
Yeah, I gave that up...

778
00:44:20,851 --> 00:44:23,911
...after maybe the first day.
Within the first hour, I gave that up.

779
00:44:24,121 --> 00:44:26,146
I'm through lying to myself,
you know?

780
00:44:26,356 --> 00:44:29,792
It's time to be mature about this
and just face facts.

781
00:44:29,993 --> 00:44:32,427
I bought myself
a hundred-thousand-dollar...

782
00:44:32,629 --> 00:44:33,960
...handicap-accessible van...

783
00:44:34,164 --> 00:44:37,861
...with the captain's chairs and the DVD
plasma screens in the back for the kids.

784
00:44:38,068 --> 00:44:40,559
- You all paid up on that?
- Yeah. That's all paid in full.

785
00:44:40,771 --> 00:44:43,741
It's parked out there.
And then the next thing I gotta do...

786
00:44:43,941 --> 00:44:47,876
...is I just gotta have a sit-down
with Carley and just let her know...

787
00:44:49,312 --> 00:44:54,046
...that it's okay for her to seek
the comfort of other men.

788
00:44:54,452 --> 00:44:58,319
Because she's gotta run wild. You
can't keep something like that back.

789
00:44:58,588 --> 00:44:59,954
Hold on, man. Hold...

790
00:45:00,491 --> 00:45:02,356
- We gotta tell him.
- Now?

791
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:05,324
No, I don't care what the doctor said,
we gotta tell him now.

792
00:45:05,530 --> 00:45:07,088
Ricky, the doctor told us...

793
00:45:07,298 --> 00:45:10,062
...that we should let you work it out
in your own sweet time...

794
00:45:10,268 --> 00:45:11,599
...but, Ricky, you can walk.

795
00:45:11,803 --> 00:45:13,498
What did you just say?

796
00:45:13,704 --> 00:45:16,798
He's telling you the truth, man.
It's all in your head.

797
00:45:19,544 --> 00:45:22,571
You sick sons of bitches!

798
00:45:22,781 --> 00:45:24,578
I mean, you walk in that door...

799
00:45:24,783 --> 00:45:28,183
...on your two legs,
all fat and cocky...

800
00:45:28,386 --> 00:45:32,915
...and looking at me in my chair,
and you tell me it's all in my head?

801
00:45:33,125 --> 00:45:35,092
I hope that both of you have sons.

802
00:45:35,293 --> 00:45:40,254
Handsome, beautiful, articulate sons
who are talented and star athletes...

803
00:45:40,499 --> 00:45:42,296
...and they have their legs
taken away!

804
00:45:42,501 --> 00:45:44,434
I pray you know
that pain and that hurt.

805
00:45:44,669 --> 00:45:46,934
Don't you put that evil on me,
Ricky Bobby!

806
00:45:47,139 --> 00:45:51,508
Don't you put that on us!
You are not paralyzed!

807
00:45:51,710 --> 00:45:53,438
I am so paralyzed!

808
00:45:53,644 --> 00:45:57,081
- No, no, no! No, he needs to know!
- Getting a little rough on him.

809
00:45:57,282 --> 00:45:59,682
- He's always crying!
- Tough love, it is. Tough love.

810
00:45:59,885 --> 00:46:02,548
- Wake up, idiot!
- You wanna know what I am?!

811
00:46:02,755 --> 00:46:05,188
You wanna see what my life is?!

812
00:46:05,390 --> 00:46:06,618
Don't do it.

813
00:46:06,825 --> 00:46:10,990
- You wanna see what's going on here?
- Don't you stick that knife in your leg.

814
00:46:19,372 --> 00:46:22,033
- Man!
- Hold on, hold on.

815
00:46:23,275 --> 00:46:25,540
- Hold on, now. Walk it off.
- Oh, that hurts.

816
00:46:25,745 --> 00:46:27,042
- Oh, my...!
- Walk it off.

817
00:46:27,247 --> 00:46:29,044
Stretch, stretch. Stretch it out.

818
00:46:29,249 --> 00:46:31,716
Hey, man.
You can walk! You can walk!

819
00:46:31,917 --> 00:46:33,476
I can walk!

820
00:46:34,254 --> 00:46:36,552
- I think I touched a nerve.
- Right there.

821
00:46:36,756 --> 00:46:39,486
All right, we got it, we got it.
Hold it right there.

822
00:46:39,692 --> 00:46:40,989
Maybe don't touch it.

823
00:46:41,194 --> 00:46:43,094
- Can you feel it?
- I can!

824
00:46:43,296 --> 00:46:45,662
We'll use this knife to pry it out.
We'll pull it out.

825
00:46:45,865 --> 00:46:48,425
- Now we got two in there.
- Just don't think about it.

826
00:46:48,636 --> 00:46:50,899
- We're going down a bad path.
- Cut around the meat.

827
00:46:51,104 --> 00:46:52,799
I'll cut right here.
Stretch it out.

828
00:46:53,006 --> 00:46:55,270
Just take out a plug of meat.
Just like a deer.

829
00:46:55,475 --> 00:46:58,206
We gotta wiggle it a little bit. That's it.
Can you feel that?

830
00:46:58,412 --> 00:47:00,208
- Yeah, I feel that.
- You are back!

831
00:47:00,413 --> 00:47:02,005
I love you guys!

832
00:47:02,682 --> 00:47:06,312
Hey, I'm sorry, guys. I mean,
I hope your boys don't lose their legs.

833
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:09,784
- Thanks, buddy.
- So when do I get to drive again?

834
00:47:09,989 --> 00:47:12,982
Well, that's the thing. The doctor
said you suffered major trauma...

835
00:47:13,194 --> 00:47:15,492
...and he thinks you should
take it slow for a while.

836
00:47:15,696 --> 00:47:19,426
Yeah, so, I was thinking, like,
while you're resting up and stuff...

837
00:47:19,632 --> 00:47:22,568
...maybe you could let me win a few.
- Well, there you go.

838
00:47:22,770 --> 00:47:24,601
Yeah, that ain't gonna happen.

839
00:47:25,105 --> 00:47:28,041
Yeah. I'm Ricky Bobby.
I mean, you know how I play it.

840
00:47:28,243 --> 00:47:30,403
- Yeah.
- First or last, right, baby?

841
00:47:30,611 --> 00:47:33,011
- Don't know what I was thinking.
- Besides...

842
00:47:33,214 --> 00:47:36,048
...Dennit Jr. Must be freaking out.
All the money he's losing?

843
00:47:36,251 --> 00:47:37,809
Without me on the track?

844
00:47:38,018 --> 00:47:39,212
I mean, I just laugh...

845
00:47:39,420 --> 00:47:42,355
...thinking about him whining
all the time, bitching and moaning:

846
00:47:42,556 --> 00:47:44,582
"Damn, I wish Ricky was here."

847
00:47:44,793 --> 00:47:46,283
You know what I mean?

848
00:47:50,164 --> 00:47:52,190
What?

849
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:54,800
Frenchy can drive.

850
00:47:58,572 --> 00:47:59,938
Oh, no.

851
00:48:27,869 --> 00:48:29,598
Very good.

852
00:48:29,804 --> 00:48:31,932
C'est la vie and que sera, sera.

853
00:48:32,141 --> 00:48:35,132
It looks like the NASCAR
has gone French.

854
00:48:35,543 --> 00:48:37,067
Well, in other news, Ricky Bobby...

855
00:48:37,279 --> 00:48:40,340
...is going to be running some test laps
this weekend at Rockingham...

856
00:48:40,549 --> 00:48:42,813
in an attempt to come back
from his grisly crash,

857
00:48:44,420 --> 00:48:46,445
It's one of the hardest things
to do in racing.

858
00:48:46,656 --> 00:48:49,318
To try to bounce back after
a devastating, violent wreck.

859
00:48:49,525 --> 00:48:51,959
Ricky Bobby was traumatized
during the incident,

860
00:48:52,161 --> 00:48:53,423
All right, baby.
Come on, now.

861
00:48:53,629 --> 00:48:56,962
But today he gets to strap back into
a racecar for the first time since

862
00:48:57,166 --> 00:48:59,293
to try to show he can still
get the job done,

863
00:48:59,502 --> 00:49:02,734
- He's gonna be great. Yep.
- He's gonna be great, sure.

864
00:49:02,939 --> 00:49:05,668
Would you stop staring at me like that,
Susan? I swear...

865
00:49:05,875 --> 00:49:08,343
...you are the weirdest little girl
I've ever seen.

866
00:49:08,544 --> 00:49:11,241
Okay, I'm really gonna open it up!

867
00:49:14,417 --> 00:49:17,477
I missed you, Mama Speed.
Ricky Bobby's back.

868
00:49:17,687 --> 00:49:19,417
Wait, how fast is he going?

869
00:49:19,623 --> 00:49:21,181
Twenty-six miles an hour.

870
00:49:23,693 --> 00:49:27,027
What were those things?
Were those the other cars?

871
00:49:32,501 --> 00:49:34,970
Oh, God. So fast.

872
00:49:35,172 --> 00:49:36,901
Go, baby! There you are.

873
00:49:37,207 --> 00:49:38,868
Am I on fire? I'm on fire.

874
00:49:39,076 --> 00:49:41,044
- No, no, you're not on fire.
- Stretch it out.

875
00:49:41,244 --> 00:49:42,836
- It's okay, baby.
- Take it easy.

876
00:49:44,448 --> 00:49:47,076
- Oh, God, I'm gonna get sick.
- Oh, God.

877
00:49:47,317 --> 00:49:51,117
- Oh, he's in his underwear again.
- Ricky! Please put your clothes on.

878
00:49:51,321 --> 00:49:53,585
He's in his underwear again.
Go get him, fellas.

879
00:49:53,790 --> 00:49:55,018
Oh, Lord.

880
00:49:55,225 --> 00:49:58,059
You know who's gonna be
number one at Dennit Racing?

881
00:49:58,863 --> 00:50:01,558
- Not Ricky?
- I'm gonna windmill you.

882
00:50:01,765 --> 00:50:04,632
Mr. Cal Naughton Jr.

883
00:50:04,835 --> 00:50:07,430
- Come back at him. It's the only way.
- Who are you?

884
00:50:07,638 --> 00:50:09,265
- Number one.
- No.

885
00:50:09,474 --> 00:50:12,966
- Oh, yes, ma'am.
- Ricky! Come on, man!

886
00:50:13,177 --> 00:50:14,542
It's embarrassing.

887
00:50:14,746 --> 00:50:18,580
The ninjas are trying to get me.
The ninjas are trying to get me.

888
00:50:18,783 --> 00:50:20,511
- Oh, my God.
- What happened?

889
00:50:20,718 --> 00:50:23,118
What happened? He's done.
He's done.

890
00:50:23,321 --> 00:50:25,846
That's what's happened.
It's over. He's finished.

891
00:50:26,124 --> 00:50:27,648
What's gonna happen to me?

892
00:50:27,859 --> 00:50:30,851
I feel like I was riding inside
an asteroid or a comet or something.

893
00:50:31,062 --> 00:50:33,053
Yeah, you were going fast.

894
00:50:33,264 --> 00:50:35,323
- Look at that.
- What are we gonna do?

895
00:50:35,533 --> 00:50:38,094
This is ugly.
This is bad for all of us. Look at that.

896
00:50:38,303 --> 00:50:41,237
- I gotta go check on cuckoo bird.
- No, cuckoo's okay.

897
00:50:41,439 --> 00:50:44,136
Why don't you get over there
and settle down Carley for me?

898
00:50:44,343 --> 00:50:46,402
- Could you do that for me?
- Yes, sir.

899
00:50:46,612 --> 00:50:48,101
There you go.

900
00:50:49,380 --> 00:50:51,405
What began as a day
of hope and optimism...

901
00:50:51,616 --> 00:50:54,916
...for Ricky Bobby and his race team
has ended here in sad disappointment.

902
00:50:55,120 --> 00:50:56,314
There we go, boy.

903
00:50:56,522 --> 00:50:58,386
- I lost all muscle control.
- Yeah, you did.

904
00:50:58,589 --> 00:51:01,991
- He just lost his muscle control is all.
- I lost my muscle control.

905
00:51:02,728 --> 00:51:05,561
He's fine.
He just can't control the muscles.

906
00:51:15,107 --> 00:51:17,507
- Thanks for the lift, Hershell.
- Yeah, no problem.

907
00:51:23,383 --> 00:51:24,782
Jenga!

908
00:51:26,552 --> 00:51:28,019
I love you, Cal.

909
00:51:29,588 --> 00:51:31,853
- Good one, kiddo.
- What the hell's going on?

910
00:51:32,058 --> 00:51:34,151
Hey, Ricky, nice of you
to stop by for a visit.

911
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:37,192
What do you mean, a visit?
This is my house.

912
00:51:37,396 --> 00:51:38,886
Baby...

913
00:51:39,098 --> 00:51:41,225
...shoot. I'm so sorry.

914
00:51:41,434 --> 00:51:43,664
I really...
I didn't want it to be this way.

915
00:51:43,870 --> 00:51:46,269
Hey, what happened
to the family portrait?

916
00:51:47,006 --> 00:51:49,167
You just crudely pasted
your face over mine.

917
00:51:49,375 --> 00:51:51,240
We're getting married, Ricky.

918
00:51:51,444 --> 00:51:53,912
And we're getting matching
leprechaun tattoos.

919
00:51:54,113 --> 00:51:56,013
Isn't that cute?
With a little pot of gold.

920
00:51:56,216 --> 00:51:58,411
Is this some kind of joke?
You guys putting me on?

921
00:51:58,618 --> 00:52:02,680
I was gone three hours.
Dennit just fired me from the team.

922
00:52:03,357 --> 00:52:04,755
Ricky, you and I...

923
00:52:04,958 --> 00:52:08,485
...we both know that this marriage
has been over for a long, long time.

924
00:52:08,728 --> 00:52:11,630
No! I honestly did not know that!

925
00:52:11,932 --> 00:52:16,334
Ricky, you can't race no more.

926
00:52:17,537 --> 00:52:21,440
I'm not going back to being poor
and dancing at the Wizard's Den.

927
00:52:21,642 --> 00:52:23,404
You know, my old boyfriend Greg?

928
00:52:23,610 --> 00:52:25,737
He still works there
and he was crazy.

929
00:52:25,945 --> 00:52:27,914
Baby, stop.

930
00:52:28,582 --> 00:52:32,416
Wait. Hold on. Hold on. Just a second.
Let me make sure I got this straight.

931
00:52:33,386 --> 00:52:35,150
Are you asking me for a divorce?

932
00:52:35,356 --> 00:52:37,881
- Yay! Two Christmases!
- Yay! Two Christmases!

933
00:52:38,092 --> 00:52:39,957
Cal?

934
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:41,992
How could you do this to me, man?

935
00:52:42,196 --> 00:52:45,791
Ricky, your marriage was
a hollow shell.

936
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,661
It was a cruel charade.

937
00:52:47,868 --> 00:52:49,894
She just gave me the 411
on the whole deal.

938
00:52:50,105 --> 00:52:53,505
And you know what else?
You never let me win one time.

939
00:52:53,707 --> 00:52:56,073
I thought we had a good thing going.
Shake and Bake.

940
00:52:56,277 --> 00:52:58,974
You're doing great.
You just keep it up. Keep it up.

941
00:52:59,180 --> 00:53:02,148
And Mr. Dennit told me
that it's my time now.

942
00:53:02,349 --> 00:53:04,408
- Oh, really?
- That Shake and Bake is dead.

943
00:53:04,618 --> 00:53:07,110
And we just came up
with a new nickname.

944
00:53:07,322 --> 00:53:09,756
- It's so good. It's so good.
- I got a new nickname.

945
00:53:10,025 --> 00:53:12,822
The Magic Man.
Now you see me...

946
00:53:13,728 --> 00:53:15,195
...now you don't.

947
00:53:15,397 --> 00:53:17,558
That is the stupidest nickname
I've ever heard.

948
00:53:17,766 --> 00:53:19,427
Is it, Ricky?

949
00:53:19,634 --> 00:53:21,898
Because I think
you wish you thought of it.

950
00:53:24,039 --> 00:53:26,507
All right. You got me.
That's an awesome nickname.

951
00:53:26,708 --> 00:53:28,869
I've always had a lot of great ideas.

952
00:53:29,078 --> 00:53:33,036
I also think I might design a car
that's in the shape of a rabbit.

953
00:53:33,248 --> 00:53:36,844
It might poop out little real rabbits out
the back that'll run around the track.

954
00:53:37,053 --> 00:53:39,316
You have live rabbits
being pooped out onto a track?

955
00:53:39,521 --> 00:53:42,251
If I win, I might do a special thing
with David Copperfield...

956
00:53:42,457 --> 00:53:44,722
...where he hides in my car
in the passenger seat...

957
00:53:44,927 --> 00:53:47,191
...and he just flings magic stuff
out the window.

958
00:53:47,730 --> 00:53:49,253
Did you run any of this
by NASCAR?

959
00:53:49,464 --> 00:53:53,094
Watch the mail for that invitation to
the wedding, because I want you there.

960
00:53:53,302 --> 00:53:54,530
- What?!
- I know it...

961
00:53:54,737 --> 00:53:57,501
...that some bad stuff happened
just now, but in time...

962
00:53:57,707 --> 00:53:59,503
The wedding's not for
a couple of weeks.

963
00:53:59,708 --> 00:54:01,574
Why would I come
to your guys' wedding?

964
00:54:01,777 --> 00:54:03,745
- You're gonna get over it
and be my best man.

965
00:54:03,946 --> 00:54:05,345
I'm not gonna be your best man!

966
00:54:05,548 --> 00:54:07,482
Baby, he's not gonna come
to the wedding.

967
00:54:07,683 --> 00:54:11,744
Cal, do you realize the implications
of your actions right now?

968
00:54:11,954 --> 00:54:13,216
What's "implication" mean?

969
00:54:13,422 --> 00:54:14,855
We are no longer friends.

970
00:54:15,091 --> 00:54:17,719
- Why?
- What do you mean, "Why?"

971
00:54:18,728 --> 00:54:20,025
You're wrecking my life!

972
00:54:20,229 --> 00:54:22,891
You just lost your wife.
You just lost your job.

973
00:54:23,099 --> 00:54:25,796
Don't throw out your best friend
because of your anger.

974
00:54:26,370 --> 00:54:29,429
- That's absolutely ridiculous, man.
- Ricky...

975
00:54:29,639 --> 00:54:34,577
...remember, the field mouse is fast,
but the owl sees at night.

976
00:54:38,347 --> 00:54:40,077
That's kind of creepy, ain't it?

977
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:46,552
- Hey, Ricky, I'll call you tomorrow.
- Shut up.

978
00:54:46,756 --> 00:54:49,419
- Bye, kids. I'll see you next weekend.
- Bye.

979
00:54:54,064 --> 00:54:57,864
Ricky! Boys! Is everything all right?

980
00:54:58,101 --> 00:55:01,730
Mama, we got nowhere to go.
Carley and Cal took everything.

981
00:55:01,938 --> 00:55:03,907
Well, you're home now,
and you got your mama.

982
00:55:04,108 --> 00:55:05,267
Get in here, boys. Come on.

983
00:55:05,475 --> 00:55:08,171
Come on. Get in this house.

984
00:55:15,052 --> 00:55:17,247
Hey, Ricky. Are you on fire?

985
00:55:18,088 --> 00:55:21,354
- Nice denim shorts, dude.
- Hey, shut up, man.

986
00:55:33,970 --> 00:55:35,370
Hump me!

987
00:55:39,343 --> 00:55:41,208
Now, you watch yourself.

988
00:55:41,412 --> 00:55:44,711
Yes, sir. I'm sorry.
I promise it won't happen again.

989
00:55:51,523 --> 00:55:53,114
Hey, sorry, man.

990
00:56:02,066 --> 00:56:03,397
Hey.

991
00:56:03,835 --> 00:56:05,564
I lost my license.

992
00:56:05,770 --> 00:56:08,035
That's why I'm on the bus.
I'm delivering pizzas.

993
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:10,640
Motherfucker,
what makes you think I care?

994
00:56:10,843 --> 00:56:13,538
Shut the fuck up!

995
00:56:14,580 --> 00:56:16,275
I was just telling you that because...

996
00:56:16,482 --> 00:56:19,781
Like I said, I lost my license. I've
been having a lot of problems lately.

997
00:56:19,985 --> 00:56:22,579
Problems? I don't wanna hear about
your damn problems.

998
00:56:22,788 --> 00:56:24,278
Everybody got problems.

999
00:56:24,490 --> 00:56:26,549
My mama got problems.
She just lost her leg.

1000
00:56:26,759 --> 00:56:30,627
My cousin Pookie just lost a testicle.
My dog threw up somebody's finger.

1001
00:56:30,829 --> 00:56:32,262
That's a problem.

1002
00:56:32,464 --> 00:56:35,331
I really regret opening my mouth
and talking to you.

1003
00:56:37,704 --> 00:56:40,297
- Sorry. Sorry.
- Get out of the road!

1004
00:56:40,506 --> 00:56:43,441
Hey, come on, man.
I'm on a bike. Relax.

1005
00:56:43,642 --> 00:56:45,941
- Hey, shut up!
- Idiot!

1006
00:56:49,882 --> 00:56:51,474
It's open.

1007
00:56:53,553 --> 00:56:55,612
Hugalo's Pizza. We are pizza.

1008
00:56:57,490 --> 00:57:00,515
- You are pizza?
- Yeah, we are pizza. I gotta say it.

1009
00:57:02,962 --> 00:57:06,193
Either close the door or come in.
I got weed in here, cowboy.

1010
00:57:12,205 --> 00:57:15,265
You got three pizzas that haven't
been eaten just sitting over there.

1011
00:57:15,475 --> 00:57:18,205
I know. I've been calling them
all day trying to get you...

1012
00:57:18,411 --> 00:57:20,777
...but they keep sending me
different delivery people.

1013
00:57:20,980 --> 00:57:22,709
Trying to get me? Why?

1014
00:57:22,916 --> 00:57:24,612
Because I'm your daddy, that's why.

1015
00:57:26,253 --> 00:57:29,312
- What did you just say?
- I said, I'm your daddy.

1016
00:57:29,522 --> 00:57:31,046
I'm Reese Bobby.

1017
00:57:31,257 --> 00:57:36,059
Me and your mama did it in a Rustler
Steak House bathroom when I was 17.

1018
00:57:36,263 --> 00:57:38,059
And then you showed up.

1019
00:57:44,872 --> 00:57:46,771
Hey, son.

1020
00:57:46,973 --> 00:57:50,239
- Son! Son, did this go good?
- No!

1021
00:57:50,444 --> 00:57:53,379
- Seems to me like it went pretty good.
- You're not my dad.

1022
00:57:53,581 --> 00:57:55,880
- It got a little heated, but...
- Stop talking to me!

1023
00:57:56,083 --> 00:57:59,177
Hey, is that a Huffy?
That's a nice-looking bike, boy.

1024
00:57:59,386 --> 00:58:01,183
I can't believe it!

1025
00:58:01,388 --> 00:58:04,517
I mean, he's been
blowing me off for 25 years...

1026
00:58:04,726 --> 00:58:07,285
...and now he wants
to get to know me?

1027
00:58:07,494 --> 00:58:09,325
How the hell did he even find me?

1028
00:58:09,530 --> 00:58:10,827
I called him.

1029
00:58:11,031 --> 00:58:13,933
Are you kidding me?
Mama, why did you go do that?

1030
00:58:14,135 --> 00:58:15,829
Son, you need help.

1031
00:58:16,036 --> 00:58:18,527
- I know he's a son of a bitch.
- He's scary.

1032
00:58:18,739 --> 00:58:22,699
But you're a grown man.
You're delivering pizzas on a bike.

1033
00:58:22,911 --> 00:58:25,606
How'd you even get hooked up
with him in the first place?

1034
00:58:25,813 --> 00:58:28,442
You probably couldn't tell
by looking at him now...

1035
00:58:28,917 --> 00:58:31,283
...but your daddy used to be
a real charmer.

1036
00:58:31,486 --> 00:58:36,355
And that night in the ladies' room of
the Rustler Steak House, he chose me.

1037
00:58:36,558 --> 00:58:41,158
- In a ladies' room?
- Shut up in here! I'm trying to sleep!

1038
00:58:41,363 --> 00:58:44,264
One of you turds is about
to get smacked in the mouth!

1039
00:58:44,466 --> 00:58:47,867
Hey, stop yelling at me, okay?
I'm your dad. You're 7 years old.

1040
00:58:48,069 --> 00:58:49,730
Don't talk like that.

1041
00:58:52,108 --> 00:58:53,631
Hey. Hey there, Lucy.

1042
00:58:53,842 --> 00:58:55,537
How you doing?

1043
00:58:56,878 --> 00:58:59,473
Oh, hey there, Ricky. Look, son...

1044
00:59:00,216 --> 00:59:02,740
...I know you don't
want me to be here...

1045
00:59:02,951 --> 00:59:06,911
...but I saw what happened to you
on the television. You saw the fear.

1046
00:59:07,123 --> 00:59:09,057
- I can help you with that, son.
- Really?

1047
00:59:09,258 --> 00:59:12,590
What do you care about me or us?
You never even met your grandkids.

1048
00:59:12,794 --> 00:59:15,923
- What are you looking at, Popeye?
- Shut up, you little pot-licker.

1049
00:59:16,132 --> 00:59:17,463
I'll put you in a microwave.

1050
00:59:17,667 --> 00:59:19,225
Now, you show me the DNA test...

1051
00:59:19,435 --> 00:59:22,404
...and then maybe I'll say hello
to these swamp rats.

1052
00:59:22,605 --> 00:59:27,338
You people shut the hell up! I got
a wife in an oxygen tent trying to sleep.

1053
00:59:27,543 --> 00:59:30,707
You better shut up or I'll come
over there and rip a hole in that tent.

1054
00:59:30,914 --> 00:59:32,073
Yeah, shut up, Frank!

1055
00:59:32,281 --> 00:59:34,749
Go shave your balls,
you dusty old fart!

1056
00:59:34,951 --> 00:59:37,317
Okay, I guess they are my grandkids.

1057
00:59:39,523 --> 00:59:42,616
I know you, son. I know you well.

1058
00:59:42,825 --> 00:59:45,989
You're just like me. Talladega's
coming up in a couple of weeks...

1059
00:59:45,996 --> 00:59:48,692
...and I know you wanna win that thing.
- No, I don't.

1060
00:59:49,199 --> 00:59:50,961
Listen, Ricky.

1061
00:59:51,167 --> 00:59:55,104
I'm 55 years old
and all I got to my name is a car...

1062
00:59:55,305 --> 00:59:59,139
...and a duffle bag full of underwear,
and sweet, stinky weed.

1063
00:59:59,343 --> 01:00:01,470
How much you selling that weed for,
old man?

1064
01:00:01,678 --> 01:00:03,976
I know I screwed up
raising you as a boy...

1065
01:00:04,181 --> 01:00:06,240
...but just let me help you as a man.

1066
01:00:07,584 --> 01:00:10,985
- Do it, Dad. Get your balls back.
- Go fast again.

1067
01:00:12,322 --> 01:00:14,415
Fine. I'll do it.

1068
01:00:15,559 --> 01:00:18,687
- But I ain't calling you Daddy.
- Well, what you gonna call me?

1069
01:00:18,896 --> 01:00:21,626
All right, Professor Dickweed.
What's the plan?

1070
01:00:21,832 --> 01:00:24,893
Well, basically, what happened to you
is that you saw the fear.

1071
01:00:25,270 --> 01:00:28,295
So before you can even think
about any real driving...

1072
01:00:28,505 --> 01:00:32,339
...you gotta make friends with that fear.
So get in the car.

1073
01:00:39,249 --> 01:00:41,946
What the hell?!
There's a goddamn cougar in the car!

1074
01:00:42,153 --> 01:00:44,144
I know there's a cougar,
I put it in there.

1075
01:00:44,355 --> 01:00:47,289
You gotta learn to drive
with the fear.

1076
01:00:47,691 --> 01:00:51,389
Ain't nothing more damn frightening
than driving with a cougar in the car.

1077
01:00:51,596 --> 01:00:53,689
- God, where'd you get that thing?
- I trapped it.

1078
01:00:53,898 --> 01:00:56,799
Been keeping it in my bathroom
at the motel, feeding it old pizza.

1079
01:00:57,001 --> 01:01:00,198
- Now get back in that car, you hear me?
- No, I'm not getting in that car.

1080
01:01:00,405 --> 01:01:05,173
Hey, listen to me. If you're calm,
that wondrous big cat will be calm too.

1081
01:01:05,377 --> 01:01:06,866
But if you're scared...

1082
01:01:07,078 --> 01:01:10,514
...that beautiful death machine
will do what God made it to do...

1083
01:01:10,715 --> 01:01:13,583
...namely, eat you
with a smile on its face.

1084
01:01:13,786 --> 01:01:15,776
God, he's just following me
wherever I go.

1085
01:01:15,987 --> 01:01:17,352
Well, he's just looking at you.

1086
01:01:17,555 --> 01:01:20,184
You're saying if I just calm down,
the cougar will be okay?

1087
01:01:20,392 --> 01:01:23,555
- You got it.
- Damn it. Okay.

1088
01:01:23,762 --> 01:01:25,786
Come on, son.
You can do it. Come on.

1089
01:01:25,997 --> 01:01:27,464
Oh, come on.

1090
01:01:28,434 --> 01:01:29,731
That's it.

1091
01:01:30,702 --> 01:01:34,399
- And no sudden moves.
- Like, is this too fast? Oh, man. See?

1092
01:01:34,606 --> 01:01:36,574
- That's a little quick.
- You see what he did?

1093
01:01:36,775 --> 01:01:39,175
You gotta be a little more deliberate
in your movement.

1094
01:01:39,378 --> 01:01:42,040
I'm just gonna get in there.
I'm just gonna grab the handle.

1095
01:01:42,247 --> 01:01:44,807
I'm gonna get in and drive that car.
I'm gonna do it calm.

1096
01:01:45,017 --> 01:01:48,418
- Calm. Piece of cake.
- I was just trying to stay calm.

1097
01:01:50,722 --> 01:01:53,089
- Oh, man!
- Sometime today, son.

1098
01:01:53,293 --> 01:01:55,556
Okay, here we go. I'm getting in.

1099
01:01:55,794 --> 01:01:57,455
Oh, God, help me!

1100
01:01:58,497 --> 01:02:00,989
- Ricky! Control your heart rate.
- Oh, my God!

1101
01:02:03,202 --> 01:02:04,499
Hey, Mama.

1102
01:02:06,572 --> 01:02:09,098
Well, hey there, Ricky. How'd it go?

1103
01:02:09,309 --> 01:02:11,777
Well, I was mauled by a cougar...

1104
01:02:11,978 --> 01:02:15,141
...learned nothing about driving,
and my Crystal Gayle shirt was ruined.

1105
01:02:15,348 --> 01:02:17,111
But other than that, it went fine.

1106
01:02:17,317 --> 01:02:18,648
Where are the boys at?

1107
01:02:18,852 --> 01:02:22,151
I dropped them off at Sunday school
at my church about 10 minutes ago.

1108
01:02:22,354 --> 01:02:23,617
Anarchy!

1109
01:02:23,823 --> 01:02:26,951
- Anarchy! Anarchy!
- Anarchy!

1110
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:30,528
- There they are.
- What in tarnation?

1111
01:02:30,731 --> 01:02:33,893
- Anarchy!
- I don't even know what that means...

1112
01:02:34,100 --> 01:02:36,261
...but I love it!

1113
01:02:38,104 --> 01:02:40,266
- What in the hell?
- That is it!

1114
01:02:40,474 --> 01:02:43,203
That puts the lid right on the jar!

1115
01:02:43,910 --> 01:02:45,309
- Mama! Mama!
- No, Ricky, no.

1116
01:02:45,512 --> 01:02:48,949
I will not have my grandbabies
acting like shiftless, wild hobos.

1117
01:02:49,150 --> 01:02:52,050
All right, now, you boys listen up,
and you listen good.

1118
01:02:52,252 --> 01:02:55,552
Now, I am declaring Granny Law.

1119
01:02:55,756 --> 01:02:59,556
And if you do not obey Granny Law...

1120
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:02,285
...I will paint your back porch red.

1121
01:03:02,496 --> 01:03:04,726
Sorry, Granny,
but you're shit out of luck.

1122
01:03:04,932 --> 01:03:07,230
We make the rules, not you.

1123
01:03:08,702 --> 01:03:10,397
Hey!

1124
01:03:11,739 --> 01:03:14,333
You're gonna break us
like wild horses, ain't you?

1125
01:03:14,975 --> 01:03:17,740
It's the beginning of a new age.

1126
01:03:19,780 --> 01:03:21,577
Hey, Derek, it's Ricky.

1127
01:03:21,782 --> 01:03:24,216
Just wondering
if you can ditch school...

1128
01:03:24,418 --> 01:03:27,217
...and take over my shift
at the pizza place...

1129
01:03:27,422 --> 01:03:29,548
...because I got strep throat.

1130
01:03:29,757 --> 01:03:32,282
And it's bad. I don't wanna
give it to everyone else.

1131
01:03:32,493 --> 01:03:34,724
So call me back.
You know the number.

1132
01:03:36,131 --> 01:03:37,098
Hello.

1133
01:03:37,432 --> 01:03:40,366
Hey, man. How's it going?
You wanna come over and party?

1134
01:03:40,568 --> 01:03:42,036
Did you just say "party"?

1135
01:03:42,237 --> 01:03:44,797
You know what? No.
Because I still hate you, okay?

1136
01:03:45,006 --> 01:03:47,997
- What are you so mad about?
- What do you think I'm mad about?

1137
01:03:48,209 --> 01:03:50,644
Come on, man, that was last week.

1138
01:03:50,845 --> 01:03:53,313
What about the time you ran over
my leg with a car?

1139
01:03:53,515 --> 01:03:57,179
- I let that go that day,
- Yeah, I remember.

1140
01:03:57,552 --> 01:03:59,213
Wind is kicking up.

1141
01:04:00,121 --> 01:04:01,748
Are you in the hot tub?

1142
01:04:01,957 --> 01:04:04,893
Answer me this:
When you're in spa mode...

1143
01:04:05,695 --> 01:04:08,254
...how come the water level
drops in the spa?

1144
01:04:08,463 --> 01:04:12,024
Are you pressing the buttons
in the back panel or in the kitchen?

1145
01:04:12,234 --> 01:04:15,432
- I just started pressing stuff.
- Hey, don't press all those buttons.

1146
01:04:16,471 --> 01:04:19,167
I'm getting bored. You wanna
come over and play G.I. Joes?

1147
01:04:19,374 --> 01:04:21,002
I would love to. No!

1148
01:04:21,477 --> 01:04:24,173
Come on, You know what?
Screw you, man,

1149
01:04:24,380 --> 01:04:27,075
Ricky, man, you gotta
cross over the anger bridge.

1150
01:04:27,282 --> 01:04:29,217
Come back to the friendship shore.

1151
01:04:29,418 --> 01:04:33,013
- "Cross over the anger bridge"?
- Yeah, that's where you're at.

1152
01:04:33,222 --> 01:04:34,985
You're stuck on an anger bridge.

1153
01:04:35,191 --> 01:04:37,921
Can you not see why
I'm stuck on the anger bridge?

1154
01:04:38,327 --> 01:04:41,524
Look, I don't know why I'm talking
to you, okay? What is it?

1155
01:04:41,731 --> 01:04:45,189
They got bottomless nachos
at Bennigan's.

1156
01:04:45,835 --> 01:04:48,133
God, a whole mess of nachos
sounds good right now.

1157
01:04:48,337 --> 01:04:50,771
I don't have a car no more,
Can you come get me?

1158
01:04:50,973 --> 01:04:54,704
I'll get you. Which one of your cars do
you miss the most? I'll bring that one.

1159
01:04:54,910 --> 01:04:56,901
- I miss the Hummer.
- I'm coming in the Hummer.

1160
01:04:57,113 --> 01:04:58,705
- Are you ready?
- Yeah, No, wait,

1161
01:04:58,914 --> 01:05:01,281
Okay. Our friendship is done.
All right?

1162
01:05:01,485 --> 01:05:03,476
- You hear?
- You wanna hang out in your house.

1163
01:05:03,687 --> 01:05:05,813
- Come on.
- Screw you, dude. I'm hanging up.

1164
01:05:06,022 --> 01:05:07,820
Okay, that's it. Bye.

1165
01:05:08,425 --> 01:05:12,259
Oh, man, this is absolutely crazy.
I mean, this is borderline reckless.

1166
01:05:12,462 --> 01:05:16,091
Don't you get it? You don't drive with
your eyes, you drive with your heart.

1167
01:05:16,333 --> 01:05:18,198
This is just dumb.
I can't see a thing.

1168
01:05:18,402 --> 01:05:22,304
You gotta feel the road.
You gotta let it live inside you.

1169
01:05:22,506 --> 01:05:25,066
- Are you feeling anything now?
- I'm feeling a little bit.

1170
01:05:25,275 --> 01:05:27,243
What do you feel?
Tell me what you're feeling.

1171
01:05:27,444 --> 01:05:30,413
I'm feeling the worn wood
of the steering wheel.

1172
01:05:30,614 --> 01:05:32,548
- Yeah. What else?
- A little bit of heat.

1173
01:05:32,749 --> 01:05:35,081
That's you and the car
melded together.

1174
01:05:35,285 --> 01:05:38,812
Yeah, now I'm really feeling it.
I feel like the car could drive itself.

1175
01:05:39,023 --> 01:05:40,854
I bet it could. Start her up.

1176
01:05:41,059 --> 01:05:43,049
I'm gonna start this car up.

1177
01:05:43,260 --> 01:05:45,421
Attaboy. All right, son.

1178
01:05:45,629 --> 01:05:47,393
Drive.

1179
01:06:05,049 --> 01:06:07,347
I'm embarrassed.
I really thought I could feel it.

1180
01:06:07,552 --> 01:06:10,817
You know what? We better hightail it
out of here. Frank's gonna be pissed.

1181
01:06:11,022 --> 01:06:12,512
All right.

1182
01:06:12,724 --> 01:06:15,215
No, no, Ricky. No blindfold.

1183
01:06:17,195 --> 01:06:19,721
Get this highway clean, come on.

1184
01:06:19,931 --> 01:06:22,525
I gotta tell you, Granny, this blows.

1185
01:06:22,734 --> 01:06:25,168
- How much more of this?
- I don't know.

1186
01:06:25,370 --> 01:06:29,102
How many more times are you gonna
toss me the radio in the bathtub?

1187
01:06:38,851 --> 01:06:40,977
- Hello?
- Hey, man. You up?

1188
01:06:41,185 --> 01:06:43,654
- No.
- Wake up, I need to talk to you,

1189
01:06:43,856 --> 01:06:45,380
I think your house is haunted.

1190
01:06:45,591 --> 01:06:47,582
Hey, come on.
It's 2:30 in the morning.

1191
01:06:47,793 --> 01:06:51,388
I can't sleep in here, man.
I'm scared.

1192
01:06:51,630 --> 01:06:54,190
Look, there's nothing to be scared of.
It's a new house...

1193
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:56,766
...there's a lot of creaks and moans
and groans in it.

1194
01:06:56,969 --> 01:07:00,871
- Put on... You got your TV on?
- Well, yeah, I fell asleep with it on.

1195
01:07:01,340 --> 01:07:04,832
- Turn on channel 42.
- Forty-two?

1196
01:07:05,043 --> 01:07:08,274
- Look at them buns.
- Well, that is a set of buns.

1197
01:07:08,580 --> 01:07:10,275
And down, and down, and...

1198
01:07:10,482 --> 01:07:12,950
What's she doing exercising
at 2:30 in the morning?

1199
01:07:13,153 --> 01:07:15,018
Oh, yeah, that's a really good point.

1200
01:07:15,221 --> 01:07:18,553
I don't know why I'm talking to you.
Do you remember that I hate you?

1201
01:07:18,757 --> 01:07:21,283
Hey, man, you know what
I was thinking?

1202
01:07:21,761 --> 01:07:24,093
- You're lucky.
- I'm lucky?

1203
01:07:24,297 --> 01:07:26,197
- How so?
- Well, check it out,

1204
01:07:26,399 --> 01:07:31,029
I'm sitting here in this enormous
haunted mansion, can't sleep.

1205
01:07:31,237 --> 01:07:33,398
You're hanging out at your mom's.
That's awesome.

1206
01:07:33,606 --> 01:07:37,565
- That's, like, the opposite of awesome.
- Well, this is like a hotel room...

1207
01:07:37,777 --> 01:07:39,335
...with someone else's junk in it.

1208
01:07:39,546 --> 01:07:43,949
Okay, yeah, well, that someone else's
junk, that used to be my stuff.

1209
01:07:44,150 --> 01:07:47,586
I'm just having a hard time, man.
I'm just calling up for some support.

1210
01:07:47,787 --> 01:07:50,881
Do you...? Do you know
how crazy that sounds?

1211
01:07:51,090 --> 01:07:52,786
- Hey, one more thing.
- Yeah?

1212
01:07:52,993 --> 01:07:57,292
When you have the stereo on
at the same time as the TV...

1213
01:07:57,497 --> 01:07:59,624
...how do you control the volume
on the TV?

1214
01:07:59,833 --> 01:08:02,325
Why do you want to listen to the TV
with the stereo on?

1215
01:08:02,536 --> 01:08:04,367
Because I like to party.

1216
01:08:04,571 --> 01:08:06,436
Why am I still talking to you?

1217
01:08:06,639 --> 01:08:08,471
Come on,
We were doing good there, man,

1218
01:08:08,676 --> 01:08:10,871
I'm taking care of your house good.

1219
01:08:11,078 --> 01:08:14,308
I keep snapping back into it.
It's like a trick you're pulling on me.

1220
01:08:14,514 --> 01:08:18,781
- All right. I'll talk to you tomorrow.
- All right, man. Talk to you tomorrow.

1221
01:08:21,555 --> 01:08:23,681
Shit.

1222
01:08:23,891 --> 01:08:26,621
Get out,

1223
01:08:33,801 --> 01:08:35,393
Where did stock-car racing
come from?

1224
01:08:35,603 --> 01:08:36,797
What?

1225
01:08:37,771 --> 01:08:41,037
- Hey, stop doing that.
- How did stock-car racing get its start?

1226
01:08:41,243 --> 01:08:44,905
Bootleggers in Prohibition had to have
cars fast enough to outrun the Feds...

1227
01:08:45,112 --> 01:08:47,877
...then they started racing each other.
- That's right.

1228
01:08:48,083 --> 01:08:51,211
If I was right, why'd you throw
another bucket on me?

1229
01:08:51,419 --> 01:08:55,219
I filled up three. Now, there's nothing
like driving to avoid jail.

1230
01:08:55,423 --> 01:08:59,018
Nothing hones your mind
and your instincts like necessity.

1231
01:08:59,227 --> 01:09:02,593
So I taped a kilo of cocaine underneath
the car and called the boys in blue.

1232
01:09:02,796 --> 01:09:05,595
Now, the way I figure it,
you got about two minutes...

1233
01:09:05,800 --> 01:09:09,167
...before they show up
and you do five to 10.

1234
01:09:09,371 --> 01:09:13,205
So, what's it gonna be?
Fear or prison?

1235
01:09:13,408 --> 01:09:16,571
- What the hell are you talking about?
- Real simple, son.

1236
01:09:16,778 --> 01:09:18,006
Cops are coming.

1237
01:09:18,213 --> 01:09:23,310
There's a kilo of Colombian bam-bam
under the car. Time to be a man.

1238
01:09:23,518 --> 01:09:27,615
- You got hair on your peaches or what?
- You're not kidding, are you? Man.

1239
01:09:28,925 --> 01:09:30,949
You crazy creep!

1240
01:09:38,234 --> 01:09:40,201
Come on, son.
What's it gonna be?

1241
01:09:40,468 --> 01:09:42,129
Speed or jail?

1242
01:09:51,814 --> 01:09:54,214
Grandpa, would you like
to take us fishing...

1243
01:09:54,417 --> 01:09:57,818
...and tell us life lessons and stories
about your childhood?

1244
01:09:58,021 --> 01:09:59,282
I got a better idea.

1245
01:09:59,488 --> 01:10:02,321
Why don't you boys go dig a hole
and I'll get another beer?

1246
01:10:02,525 --> 01:10:06,553
Someone didn't love you enough
when you were little, did they?

1247
01:10:06,763 --> 01:10:09,526
Good call.
Here, that's worth a nickel.

1248
01:10:09,732 --> 01:10:10,960
Tragic.

1249
01:10:17,707 --> 01:10:19,971
Son of a bitch, son of a bitch,
son of a bitch.

1250
01:10:21,277 --> 01:10:23,246
Oh, man. Oh, man!

1251
01:10:26,149 --> 01:10:28,639
One-sixteen. One-sixteen!

1252
01:10:28,851 --> 01:10:31,184
I'm going fast again!

1253
01:10:51,008 --> 01:10:52,669
Pull over! Pull over!

1254
01:10:52,877 --> 01:10:56,710
Pull over?
I'll pull over for you. How about this?

1255
01:11:31,783 --> 01:11:33,581
Where are you?

1256
01:11:37,321 --> 01:11:39,152
Gotcha.

1257
01:11:49,635 --> 01:11:51,330
"Feels good going fast, doesn't it?

1258
01:11:51,537 --> 01:11:56,634
By the way, don't try and snort
these Lucky Charms. Reese."

1259
01:11:58,477 --> 01:12:00,069
Okay.

1260
01:12:01,180 --> 01:12:02,703
Okay.

1261
01:12:15,294 --> 01:12:16,522
There you go, little man.

1262
01:12:27,474 --> 01:12:28,907
Hey, Ricky!

1263
01:12:29,109 --> 01:12:30,633
How you doing?

1264
01:12:34,646 --> 01:12:38,447
- Oh, Nana, not my prison shank.
- In the can.

1265
01:12:47,460 --> 01:12:50,292
There's your
mother-flipping driving test.

1266
01:12:50,496 --> 01:12:53,364
Mr. Bobby, you are magnificent.

1267
01:12:55,268 --> 01:12:59,261
Down, Karen! Get down!
Get down, Karen!

1268
01:12:59,472 --> 01:13:01,167
It's all right. It's gonna be okay.

1269
01:13:10,016 --> 01:13:13,611
Well, son, you are looking good
behind that wheel.

1270
01:13:13,820 --> 01:13:17,655
Thanks, Daddy. I gotta tell you,
I feel good. Heck, you know what?

1271
01:13:17,858 --> 01:13:20,451
Let's go out tonight, you know,
the whole family.

1272
01:13:21,027 --> 01:13:23,997
I'm talking about sitting down,
enjoying a gourmet meal...

1273
01:13:24,198 --> 01:13:26,462
...at a place that's real special.

1274
01:13:26,667 --> 01:13:29,966
- Hi. Those plates are hot. Enjoy.
- You got your own skillet.

1275
01:13:30,171 --> 01:13:32,537
- Be back to check on you in a minute.
- Thank you.

1276
01:13:32,740 --> 01:13:35,004
Oh, gooder than grits.

1277
01:13:35,209 --> 01:13:36,540
Let us pray.

1278
01:13:38,445 --> 01:13:40,242
Dear Lord baby Jesus...

1279
01:13:40,447 --> 01:13:43,439
...lying there
in your little ghost manger...

1280
01:13:43,651 --> 01:13:47,052
...just looking at your Baby Einstein
developmental videos...

1281
01:13:47,254 --> 01:13:49,313
...learning about shapes
and colors and...

1282
01:13:49,523 --> 01:13:51,923
We just have so much
to be thankful for.

1283
01:13:52,126 --> 01:13:54,425
First off, my sons no longer act...

1284
01:13:54,629 --> 01:13:56,858
...like retarded gangbangers.
- Amen.

1285
01:13:57,064 --> 01:13:59,498
Also, I got my balls back
behind the wheel of a car.

1286
01:13:59,700 --> 01:14:01,862
And most importantly,
we thank you...

1287
01:14:02,070 --> 01:14:06,005
...for bringing back our nasty,
delinquent, pot-dealing daddy to us.

1288
01:14:06,207 --> 01:14:09,200
For he was lost,
but now he is found. Amen.

1289
01:14:09,411 --> 01:14:11,709
- Amen.
- Amen.

1290
01:14:11,913 --> 01:14:13,312
Son, that was lovely.

1291
01:14:13,515 --> 01:14:15,312
- What a lovely meal.
- It sure is.

1292
01:14:15,516 --> 01:14:17,712
It certainly does look delicious.

1293
01:14:17,919 --> 01:14:20,979
I gotta tell you, this is about
a damn perfect evening right now.

1294
01:14:21,189 --> 01:14:23,817
It is, isn't it?

1295
01:14:24,025 --> 01:14:25,959
You know what we should do?

1296
01:14:26,161 --> 01:14:29,153
Every week, we should come back
to this Applebee's...

1297
01:14:29,364 --> 01:14:32,527
...and sit at this table,
and have a family meal.

1298
01:14:32,735 --> 01:14:35,134
- That's a great idea, Mama.
- And order the same stuff.

1299
01:14:35,337 --> 01:14:38,238
- That would be great.
- And I would be delighted, Reese...

1300
01:14:38,440 --> 01:14:42,502
...if you would accompany me to
ballroom dancing on Tuesday nights.

1301
01:14:42,945 --> 01:14:44,502
- Tuesday night?
- It's a lot of fun.

1302
01:14:44,713 --> 01:14:47,375
- I think you'd have a good time.
- How's everybody doing here?

1303
01:14:47,582 --> 01:14:50,552
- Dolly, it's so good.
- Oh, it's really, really good.

1304
01:14:50,753 --> 01:14:55,189
You know, I just...
I hate to be a pain, darling...

1305
01:14:58,060 --> 01:15:00,790
...but I asked for no onions
on my Bourbon Steak.

1306
01:15:01,130 --> 01:15:03,222
I am so sorry.
I thought you asked for onions...

1307
01:15:03,431 --> 01:15:05,263
Okay, okay,
maybe don't interrupt me.

1308
01:15:05,468 --> 01:15:08,528
- I'm sorry, I didn't mean to.
- Yeah, well, I think you did mean to...

1309
01:15:08,738 --> 01:15:12,970
...and I also think that you meant
to put the damn onions on my steak.

1310
01:15:13,175 --> 01:15:14,904
- Okay, Reese.
- Grandfather...

1311
01:15:15,111 --> 01:15:18,137
...can't we resolve
this conflict without anger?

1312
01:15:19,548 --> 01:15:22,779
- I'm a veteran and a diabetic!
- Dad!

1313
01:15:23,319 --> 01:15:26,914
- Dad! Why are you doing this?
- Applebee's has rats!

1314
01:15:27,123 --> 01:15:29,319
I found a whole rat
in my Cobb salad!

1315
01:15:29,526 --> 01:15:30,857
Dad, where are you going?

1316
01:15:31,061 --> 01:15:33,255
Come on, frat boy, you wanna go?

1317
01:15:33,462 --> 01:15:36,899
- What's going on, man?
- Ricky, let him go!

1318
01:15:37,100 --> 01:15:40,627
- Things were going good, weren't they?
- That's exactly why I had to blow it up.

1319
01:15:40,837 --> 01:15:42,701
I don't know what organ or bone
people have...

1320
01:15:42,905 --> 01:15:45,739
...that makes them act right,
but I was born without it. I'm no good.

1321
01:15:45,943 --> 01:15:50,380
All those races I won,
that was for you, you know that?

1322
01:15:50,579 --> 01:15:55,313
I did just like you told me:
"If you ain't first, you're last."

1323
01:15:55,519 --> 01:15:57,180
What the hell are you talking about?

1324
01:15:57,387 --> 01:16:00,015
What you told me
that day at school for career day.

1325
01:16:01,925 --> 01:16:05,656
You came in and you said,
"If you ain't first, you're last."

1326
01:16:07,265 --> 01:16:10,290
Oh, hell, Ricky,
I was high when I said that.

1327
01:16:10,500 --> 01:16:12,195
That doesn't make any sense at all.

1328
01:16:12,402 --> 01:16:16,339
"You're first or last." You can
be second, you can be third, fourth.

1329
01:16:16,541 --> 01:16:18,338
Hell, you can even be fifth.

1330
01:16:18,543 --> 01:16:23,105
What are you talking about?
I lived my whole life based on that.

1331
01:16:23,548 --> 01:16:25,607
Well, now what the hell
am I supposed to do?

1332
01:16:27,485 --> 01:16:30,852
Well, that's the million-dollar question,
isn't it?

1333
01:16:34,459 --> 01:16:36,484
Good luck to you, son.

1334
01:16:37,428 --> 01:16:39,055
Hey, Dad!

1335
01:16:40,431 --> 01:16:41,864
Where are you going?

1336
01:16:42,867 --> 01:16:44,767
Does it matter?

1337
01:17:15,901 --> 01:17:17,193
Here we go.

1338
01:17:19,171 --> 01:17:20,661
Hey, don't bump me.

1339
01:17:21,874 --> 01:17:24,104
Oh, man, I'm flying.

1340
01:17:28,814 --> 01:17:31,544
Game over. Come on, reset.

1341
01:17:31,750 --> 01:17:34,413
Boy, you are a terrible driver, no?

1342
01:17:34,621 --> 01:17:36,349
How'd you get on a video game
so fast?

1343
01:17:36,555 --> 01:17:40,252
Is your name, by chance,
Ricky Bobby?

1344
01:17:40,459 --> 01:17:43,725
Hey, screw you, man!
I got nothing because of you!

1345
01:17:46,465 --> 01:17:48,934
- I hate you!
- Hey, Ricky.

1346
01:17:49,135 --> 01:17:52,161
I am on fire, I am on fire,

1347
01:17:52,906 --> 01:17:54,099
Susan?

1348
01:17:54,306 --> 01:17:57,208
And so then I got a marketing
job with NASCAR.

1349
01:17:57,410 --> 01:18:00,379
- Really?
- Yeah, it's great. It's great.

1350
01:18:00,580 --> 01:18:04,208
Well, gosh, you look fantastic.

1351
01:18:04,416 --> 01:18:07,853
- Thank you.
- I mean, you've always looked good.

1352
01:18:08,922 --> 01:18:12,552
I mean, I'm just... I'm happy for you.

1353
01:18:13,493 --> 01:18:14,892
Thank you.

1354
01:18:16,096 --> 01:18:17,586
But what about you?

1355
01:18:17,797 --> 01:18:19,924
How have you been?
What have you been doing?

1356
01:18:20,133 --> 01:18:23,864
Well, they want me to race at Talladega
next weekend, but I'm not gonna do it.

1357
01:18:24,070 --> 01:18:26,732
Because I'm done.
I'm done with the racing, with driving.

1358
01:18:26,940 --> 01:18:29,603
- Why would you do that?
- Because I've really moved on.

1359
01:18:29,844 --> 01:18:32,277
I've sent in my application to
The Real World...

1360
01:18:32,479 --> 01:18:33,969
...so I'm hoping to hear back.

1361
01:18:34,180 --> 01:18:37,582
I'm putting a lot of my eggs into
that basket, the MTV basket.

1362
01:18:37,785 --> 01:18:41,084
I'm also thinking about getting a gun
and dealing crack.

1363
01:18:41,288 --> 01:18:45,088
Being a crack dealer, but not like
a mean crack dealer, but like a...

1364
01:18:45,292 --> 01:18:47,385
You know, like a nice one.

1365
01:18:47,595 --> 01:18:49,586
Just kind of friendly, like, "Hey...

1366
01:18:49,797 --> 01:18:52,095
...what's up, guys?
You want some crack?"

1367
01:18:52,299 --> 01:18:55,564
I'm just waiting on those two things
to kind of flesh themselves out.

1368
01:18:55,803 --> 01:18:56,770
You know what, Ricky?

1369
01:18:56,971 --> 01:19:00,930
I have kept my mouth shut
for a really, really long time.

1370
01:19:01,142 --> 01:19:03,542
And I just don't think that I can
keep it shut anymore.

1371
01:19:03,744 --> 01:19:06,679
I just have to tell you that I think
you are making a big mistake.

1372
01:19:06,881 --> 01:19:08,509
- Really?
- Yes.

1373
01:19:08,717 --> 01:19:12,174
Why is it that you always fall
for people who leave you?

1374
01:19:12,620 --> 01:19:14,281
Have you noticed that?

1375
01:19:14,488 --> 01:19:19,552
Like Carley and your dad
and your sponsors.

1376
01:19:19,960 --> 01:19:23,397
And you always have
to prove yourself. Wh...?

1377
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:27,594
Well, you gotta listen
to me here, okay?

1378
01:19:27,802 --> 01:19:32,000
You gotta win to get love.
Everyone knows that.

1379
01:19:32,207 --> 01:19:34,437
I mean, that's just life.

1380
01:19:37,379 --> 01:19:40,507
Look at Don Shula,
legendary coach.

1381
01:19:40,715 --> 01:19:44,116
Look at that Asian guy
who holds the world record...

1382
01:19:44,319 --> 01:19:46,219
...for eating all those hot dogs
in a row.

1383
01:19:46,454 --> 01:19:50,117
Look at Rue McClanahan
from The Golden Girls.

1384
01:19:51,059 --> 01:19:54,290
All three people,
all great champions, all loved.

1385
01:19:54,530 --> 01:19:57,021
Do you wanna know why I think
that you should race again?

1386
01:19:58,099 --> 01:19:59,293
Sure. Why?

1387
01:19:59,501 --> 01:20:03,734
Okay. It's because
it's what you love, Ricky.

1388
01:20:04,173 --> 01:20:06,937
It is who you were born to be.

1389
01:20:07,142 --> 01:20:10,408
And here you sit, thinking.

1390
01:20:10,613 --> 01:20:15,676
Well, Ricky Bobby is not a thinker.
Ricky Bobby is a driver.

1391
01:20:15,885 --> 01:20:18,217
He is a doer.
And that's what you need to do.

1392
01:20:18,421 --> 01:20:20,252
You don't need to think,
you need to drive.

1393
01:20:20,456 --> 01:20:24,290
You need speed. You need to go out
there, and you need to rev your engine.

1394
01:20:24,493 --> 01:20:25,517
You need to fire it up.

1395
01:20:25,728 --> 01:20:28,424
You need to grab hold of the line
between speed and chaos...

1396
01:20:28,631 --> 01:20:31,395
...and you need to wrestle it
to the ground like a demon cobra.

1397
01:20:31,601 --> 01:20:34,400
And then, when that fear rises up
in your belly, you use it...

1398
01:20:34,605 --> 01:20:37,505
...and you know that fear is powerful
because it has been there...

1399
01:20:37,707 --> 01:20:41,735
...for billions of years! And it is good,
and you use it, and you ride it.

1400
01:20:41,945 --> 01:20:44,743
You ride it like a skeleton horse
through the gates of hell...

1401
01:20:44,948 --> 01:20:46,414
...and then you win! You win!

1402
01:20:46,616 --> 01:20:49,346
You don't win for anybody else,
you win for you. You know why?

1403
01:20:49,553 --> 01:20:51,783
Because a man takes what he wants,
he takes it all.

1404
01:20:51,989 --> 01:20:54,617
And you're a man, aren't you?
Aren't you?

1405
01:20:55,558 --> 01:20:57,652
Susan, I've never heard you
talk like that.

1406
01:21:01,064 --> 01:21:02,998
Are we about to get it on?

1407
01:21:03,200 --> 01:21:05,964
Because I'm as hard as a diamond
in an ice storm right now.

1408
01:21:09,773 --> 01:21:11,741
- This is awesome.
- Yes, it is.

1409
01:21:11,942 --> 01:21:14,877
- Are you climbing on the table now?
- Yes, sir.

1410
01:21:20,350 --> 01:21:22,785
I can't believe this.

1411
01:21:22,987 --> 01:21:28,789
This is like that Whitesnake video
where the girl crawls on...

1412
01:21:28,993 --> 01:21:31,860
Yeah. Just like that.
What's her name?

1413
01:21:32,063 --> 01:21:34,121
Tawny Kitaen. She's really good.

1414
01:21:34,331 --> 01:21:36,265
- She's great.
- She's fantastic.

1415
01:21:37,502 --> 01:21:39,026
Everyone, turn away.

1416
01:21:39,237 --> 01:21:43,263
Things are gonna get crazy.
We're gonna make animal noises.

1417
01:22:18,510 --> 01:22:20,807
- Looks good, damn good.
- Yeah. That's good, guys.

1418
01:22:21,012 --> 01:22:23,607
Yeah, Ricky, it's good to be back.

1419
01:22:23,816 --> 01:22:25,443
- Talladega.
- Talladega.

1420
01:22:25,784 --> 01:22:27,775
I missed you dudes.

1421
01:22:27,986 --> 01:22:29,180
Even you too, Glenn.

1422
01:22:30,988 --> 01:22:36,017
I didn't have a whole lot of money left,
but what I did I put into the car.

1423
01:22:36,228 --> 01:22:39,129
We got some lower-end sponsors,
so it's nothing to shout about...

1424
01:22:39,331 --> 01:22:41,492
...but at least we got
something to run in.

1425
01:22:41,800 --> 01:22:43,062
Let's see what we got, guys.

1426
01:22:44,536 --> 01:22:47,529
What are we looking at?
"Julio's thongs for men"?

1427
01:22:47,741 --> 01:22:49,867
Come on, what kind of dude
wears a thong?

1428
01:22:50,075 --> 01:22:52,066
Yeah, that's messed up.

1429
01:22:52,411 --> 01:22:53,708
Perverts, you know?

1430
01:22:55,248 --> 01:22:56,681
It's not the best car, but it'll move.

1431
01:22:58,051 --> 01:23:01,679
Hold on, now, baby. Let's just see
what this thing's got under the hood.

1432
01:23:03,690 --> 01:23:06,386
- There she is.
- Looks like the Pep Boys threw up.

1433
01:23:06,593 --> 01:23:08,389
- Damn.
- Like I said, work in progress.

1434
01:23:08,594 --> 01:23:12,224
All right, I tell you what we gotta do.
Since we got no corporate money...

1435
01:23:12,432 --> 01:23:14,263
...we have to build this
engine ourselves.

1436
01:23:14,467 --> 01:23:18,631
I want you to hit up every independent
driver out there for spare parts.

1437
01:23:18,838 --> 01:23:20,772
Yeah, Lucius, that's crazy.

1438
01:23:20,974 --> 01:23:24,239
Well, crazy is all we got
right now, okay? So do it.

1439
01:23:24,444 --> 01:23:25,502
Now, where you going?

1440
01:23:25,845 --> 01:23:28,109
I wanna tell Gerard Depardieu
we're coming for him.

1441
01:23:28,314 --> 01:23:30,976
There you go, baby. Give him hell.

1442
01:23:31,184 --> 01:23:34,643
Get this engine built. Get it built.

1443
01:23:40,960 --> 01:23:42,861
I have not finished.

1444
01:23:50,771 --> 01:23:54,468
Monsieur Girard,
Ricky Bobby is here to see you.

1445
01:23:54,675 --> 01:23:58,543
This is the one I was talking about,
Ricky Bobby.

1446
01:23:59,847 --> 01:24:02,281
Thank you, Bacco. Go.

1447
01:24:03,050 --> 01:24:05,347
You're a tough man to find.
You know that, buster?

1448
01:24:05,552 --> 01:24:08,147
I prefer solitude
the day before a race.

1449
01:24:08,355 --> 01:24:11,324
I am being so incredibly rude,
Monsieur Bobby.

1450
01:24:11,525 --> 01:24:13,960
Let me introduce you
to my lunch guests.

1451
01:24:14,162 --> 01:24:17,426
This is my dear old friend
Elvis Costello.

1452
01:24:17,631 --> 01:24:21,398
Delightful to meet you, Mr. Robert.
I thought you were dead.

1453
01:24:22,003 --> 01:24:28,168
And next to him is hip-hop artist,
poet and my brother-in-law, Mos Def.

1454
01:24:28,375 --> 01:24:31,072
I like your driving style.
I'm more of a Tony Stewart man...

1455
01:24:31,279 --> 01:24:32,803
...number 20 car, myself.

1456
01:24:33,014 --> 01:24:35,004
How he gets into
those straightaways.

1457
01:24:35,216 --> 01:24:36,740
Gets it in the paint. Get her done!

1458
01:24:36,951 --> 01:24:39,716
And across from Monsieur Def...

1459
01:24:40,589 --> 01:24:41,988
...is Breeze.

1460
01:24:42,190 --> 01:24:45,318
Hey. You're Breeze or you're Breeze?
Which one of you is Breeze?

1461
01:24:45,527 --> 01:24:47,995
Together we are Breeze.

1462
01:24:48,196 --> 01:24:51,962
They are like twins,
born from different wombs.

1463
01:24:52,466 --> 01:24:53,866
- Right.
- They are God's most...

1464
01:24:54,069 --> 01:24:56,299
...beautiful mistake.

1465
01:24:56,738 --> 01:25:00,174
They do everything together.
Everything.

1466
01:25:00,375 --> 01:25:02,741
They read the same books.

1467
01:25:02,944 --> 01:25:06,607
They do Pilates together.

1468
01:25:07,782 --> 01:25:10,115
They walk, talk, sleep...

1469
01:25:10,486 --> 01:25:12,248
...even go make toilet.

1470
01:25:12,454 --> 01:25:14,388
Okay, you're starting
to creep me out, man.

1471
01:25:14,589 --> 01:25:16,147
A single plop.

1472
01:25:16,359 --> 01:25:17,986
One single plop.

1473
01:25:19,862 --> 01:25:21,658
I don't need to hear about
doing a toilet.

1474
01:25:21,863 --> 01:25:23,296
You want more examples?

1475
01:25:23,498 --> 01:25:26,627
- No, you listed like 8000.
- Less than that.

1476
01:25:26,836 --> 01:25:28,701
- It's none of my business.
- More like...

1477
01:25:28,905 --> 01:25:30,531
...I don't know, between five and 10.

1478
01:25:30,739 --> 01:25:32,833
Look, I need to talk to you.

1479
01:25:33,175 --> 01:25:34,733
Walk with me, Ricky Bobby.

1480
01:25:34,944 --> 01:25:37,139
- You have a good lunch.
- Take care, man.

1481
01:25:37,847 --> 01:25:39,974
- Goodbye, Ricky.
- Goodbye.

1482
01:25:40,182 --> 01:25:43,015
Holding hands with a man
makes me terribly uncomfortable.

1483
01:25:43,219 --> 01:25:46,313
It is a sign of friendship
in many countries.

1484
01:25:46,522 --> 01:25:48,218
Well, not in ours.

1485
01:25:48,425 --> 01:25:51,052
There's nothing sexual about it.

1486
01:25:51,260 --> 01:25:53,660
Please don't be worried at the fact
I have an erection.

1487
01:25:53,863 --> 01:25:56,662
- It has nothing to do with you.
- Hey, come on.

1488
01:25:56,867 --> 01:26:01,565
Look. Here's the deal.
I came here to tell you one thing.

1489
01:26:01,771 --> 01:26:04,502
All right?
Tomorrow, I'm coming for you.

1490
01:26:04,708 --> 01:26:07,734
Do you know why I came to America,
Ricky Bobby?

1491
01:26:08,378 --> 01:26:11,472
Public schools, health-care system,
giant water parks.

1492
01:26:11,682 --> 01:26:13,912
I mean, the same reason
anyone comes to America.

1493
01:26:15,218 --> 01:26:18,618
I came here for you to beat me.

1494
01:26:19,089 --> 01:26:22,115
- What the hell are you talking about?
- My husband, Gregory, and I...

1495
01:26:22,326 --> 01:26:26,126
...wish only for that
which every other couple wishes for:

1496
01:26:26,330 --> 01:26:30,266
To tame Komodo dragons
in Sri Lanka...

1497
01:26:30,467 --> 01:26:33,561
...and teach them
to perform Hamlet.

1498
01:26:33,770 --> 01:26:35,295
But before I can do that...

1499
01:26:35,506 --> 01:26:38,065
- That's dumb.
- It's not dumb.

1500
01:26:38,275 --> 01:26:40,106
- It is dumb.
- Why is it dumb?

1501
01:26:40,310 --> 01:26:42,244
- I don't know.
- But before I can do that...

1502
01:26:42,446 --> 01:26:46,780
...I must be beaten by a driver
who's truly better than me.

1503
01:26:47,017 --> 01:26:49,247
So you're gonna lose to me
on purpose?

1504
01:26:49,453 --> 01:26:51,149
- No.
- No?

1505
01:26:51,356 --> 01:26:52,653
No!

1506
01:26:53,758 --> 01:26:56,351
I will battle you with the entirety
of my heart.

1507
01:26:56,560 --> 01:26:58,392
And you will probably lose.

1508
01:26:59,063 --> 01:27:03,397
But maybe, just maybe...

1509
01:27:04,102 --> 01:27:06,400
...you might challenge me.

1510
01:27:06,604 --> 01:27:08,162
God needs the devil.

1511
01:27:08,373 --> 01:27:11,274
The Beatles needed
the Rolling Stones.

1512
01:27:11,476 --> 01:27:14,935
Even Diane Sawyer
needed Katie Couric.

1513
01:27:16,180 --> 01:27:18,944
Will you be my Katie Couric?

1514
01:27:21,352 --> 01:27:23,685
I feel like I'm in Highlander.

1515
01:27:26,824 --> 01:27:28,314
What's the Highlander?

1516
01:27:28,526 --> 01:27:29,720
It's a movie.

1517
01:27:29,928 --> 01:27:31,793
- Any good?
- Very good.

1518
01:27:31,997 --> 01:27:33,931
- It won the Academy Award.
- Oh, for what?

1519
01:27:34,132 --> 01:27:35,793
For best movie ever made.

1520
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:39,095
I just want you to know I came here
today to tell you one thing.

1521
01:27:39,304 --> 01:27:42,137
That come race time tomorrow,
I'm coming for you, all right?

1522
01:27:43,108 --> 01:27:45,234
- May God be with you.
- Yeah.

1523
01:27:45,444 --> 01:27:48,675
Because although
today I am friendly...

1524
01:27:49,682 --> 01:27:54,085
...tomorrow will be war!

1525
01:27:55,120 --> 01:27:56,178
All right.

1526
01:28:01,394 --> 01:28:05,022
Ladies and gentlemen, pull up a chair,
drop the kids off with their aunt

1527
01:28:05,230 --> 01:28:08,028
and take the phone off the hook
because it's race day here

1528
01:28:08,233 --> 01:28:10,361
at the Talladega Superspeedway,

1529
01:28:20,747 --> 01:28:22,543
Hey, guys.

1530
01:28:25,051 --> 01:28:26,985
- Why so down?
- Ricky...

1531
01:28:27,187 --> 01:28:29,712
...we were up all night
working on the car.

1532
01:28:29,923 --> 01:28:31,981
And then something happened.
There was a fire.

1533
01:28:32,191 --> 01:28:33,557
Did you say "fire"?

1534
01:28:33,760 --> 01:28:35,193
Glenn is dead, Ricky.

1535
01:28:36,296 --> 01:28:39,527
I mean,
he died last night in my arms...

1536
01:28:39,733 --> 01:28:41,257
...as I held him.
- Oh, man.

1537
01:28:41,468 --> 01:28:44,096
He was so scared,
because you know how little he is.

1538
01:28:44,304 --> 01:28:46,534
And death was coming for him,
and he stood there...

1539
01:28:46,740 --> 01:28:50,301
...and with a tear coming out his eyes,
he said, "Tell Ricky, win for me."

1540
01:28:50,510 --> 01:28:53,240
That's all that little bastard wanted,
was for you to win.

1541
01:28:53,446 --> 01:28:54,708
I wish you could've seen him.

1542
01:28:54,914 --> 01:28:57,475
I wish you could've felt
his little heart fluttering.

1543
01:28:57,685 --> 01:28:59,084
Sweet Jesus.

1544
01:28:59,652 --> 01:29:01,677
Poor Glenn.

1545
01:29:03,757 --> 01:29:06,784
Hey, what the hell, man.
Hey, Glenn. Glenn!

1546
01:29:09,029 --> 01:29:12,396
- I see you.
- Glenn, what did I say?

1547
01:29:12,600 --> 01:29:15,194
- I said, "Wait till after the race."
- Was he crying?

1548
01:29:15,402 --> 01:29:18,859
I'm sorry, Ricky. We were just trying to
give you a little extra motivation.

1549
01:29:19,072 --> 01:29:21,906
Well, that is just sick, guys.

1550
01:29:22,109 --> 01:29:25,078
It's okay, Susie.
I appreciate it, guys.

1551
01:29:25,279 --> 01:29:26,610
Just trying to help out...

1552
01:29:26,847 --> 01:29:29,577
...even though
it was weird and perverse.

1553
01:29:29,784 --> 01:29:32,150
They're just trying to help, Ricky.
We're a team here.

1554
01:29:32,353 --> 01:29:34,583
- I appreciate it.
- Let's see what's under the hood.

1555
01:29:34,789 --> 01:29:36,917
All right, let's have a look.

1556
01:29:42,696 --> 01:29:45,860
Hot dog. I mean, that's like looking up
Bridgette Wilson-Sampras' skirt.

1557
01:29:46,067 --> 01:29:49,365
We were up all night working on it.
Like I said, a lot of teams gave parts.

1558
01:29:49,570 --> 01:29:50,764
Nice work, guys.

1559
01:29:50,971 --> 01:29:54,533
And your sponsors weren't doing
very much, so...

1560
01:29:54,743 --> 01:29:56,710
...well, we repainted the car.

1561
01:29:56,911 --> 01:29:59,176
Well, take a look. Come on, guys.

1562
01:30:02,017 --> 01:30:05,248
Well, I like the cougar,
but what company is "M.E."?

1563
01:30:05,453 --> 01:30:07,717
"Me" is you...

1564
01:30:07,923 --> 01:30:09,584
...because it's just you out there.

1565
01:30:09,791 --> 01:30:12,589
We don't have
any corporate sponsors.

1566
01:30:12,794 --> 01:30:14,990
We don't have
any fancy team owners.

1567
01:30:15,198 --> 01:30:16,789
We have you...

1568
01:30:16,998 --> 01:30:19,899
...and this car, and this cougar...

1569
01:30:20,101 --> 01:30:22,935
...which symbolizes the fear
that you have overcome.

1570
01:30:23,139 --> 01:30:24,936
It's all there for you.

1571
01:30:25,407 --> 01:30:30,505
Ricky, this car is like your Excalibur,
the mighty sword King Arthur used...

1572
01:30:30,713 --> 01:30:33,113
...to bring together
the Knights of the Round Table...

1573
01:30:33,316 --> 01:30:38,082
...until Lancelot betrayed him by laying
with his queen, in the biblical sense.

1574
01:30:38,287 --> 01:30:39,914
Okay, Glenn.

1575
01:30:40,122 --> 01:30:43,091
Everything cool that Susan said,
you wrecked it.

1576
01:30:44,893 --> 01:30:47,021
Guys, let's go win ourselves
a race, all right?

1577
01:30:47,230 --> 01:30:49,289
- There you go. Yeah!
- Right?

1578
01:30:49,498 --> 01:30:51,892
Let's get out there and win a race.

1579
01:31:06,082 --> 01:31:07,515
From Provence, France

1580
01:31:07,717 --> 01:31:11,347
driver of the number 55
Perrier car

1581
01:31:11,555 --> 01:31:14,546
Jean Girard,

1582
01:31:22,032 --> 01:31:24,465
From West River, North Carolina

1583
01:31:24,700 --> 01:31:27,898
<i>driver of the number 47
Old Spice car</i>

1584
01:31:28,105 --> 01:31:31,302
Cal Naughton Jr,

1585
01:31:40,417 --> 01:31:42,214
Hey, Carley.

1586
01:31:42,419 --> 01:31:46,014
- Hey, Ricky.
- Carley! Hey, baby.

1587
01:31:47,925 --> 01:31:49,484
Baby.

1588
01:31:49,694 --> 01:31:51,661
Oh, hey, Ricky.

1589
01:31:51,862 --> 01:31:54,456
Hey, man.
We missed you at the wedding.

1590
01:31:54,665 --> 01:31:57,635
- You missed me at the wedding?
- Oh, man, it was so classy.

1591
01:31:57,835 --> 01:32:01,201
We had a Styx cover band
and a nacho fountain.

1592
01:32:01,405 --> 01:32:04,374
Check it, it was a nacho fountain
with six kinds of cheese on it.

1593
01:32:04,575 --> 01:32:07,806
- Liquid cheese? It cascaded down?
- Yeah.

1594
01:32:08,012 --> 01:32:10,104
- Are you serious?
- Amazing. Six different kinds.

1595
01:32:10,314 --> 01:32:11,838
Swiss, Havarti.
What was the other one?

1596
01:32:12,049 --> 01:32:13,108
- Gouda.
- Cheddar, Gouda.

1597
01:32:13,318 --> 01:32:15,252
That's the greatest thing
I ever heard of.

1598
01:32:15,453 --> 01:32:17,318
Bean buffet in front of it.
It was awesome.

1599
01:32:17,522 --> 01:32:20,787
Don't listen to him. And remember
one thing, he's the competition.

1600
01:32:20,992 --> 01:32:23,825
You're not very focused right now.
I need you to focus.

1601
01:32:24,028 --> 01:32:25,359
- Hey.
- What?

1602
01:32:25,563 --> 01:32:27,827
- I'm the Magic Man now. Okay?
- Yeah, I know.

1603
01:32:28,033 --> 01:32:31,001
So get ready for some tricks up
these sleeves, all right?

1604
01:32:31,202 --> 01:32:32,464
Watch your buns, pal.

1605
01:32:32,670 --> 01:32:35,434
Baby, that is real good talk.
Like we practiced last night.

1606
01:32:35,640 --> 01:32:38,041
I got something to tell you,
you mangy piece of trash.

1607
01:32:38,243 --> 01:32:40,870
- What?
- I'm sorry.

1608
01:32:43,047 --> 01:32:46,506
I took you for granted, Cal, and you
were a really good friend to me...

1609
01:32:46,785 --> 01:32:49,981
...and I never gave you your due.
It was my fault.

1610
01:32:51,155 --> 01:32:54,523
I'll tell you the truth.
I'm a little confused by your tactics.

1611
01:32:54,727 --> 01:32:57,524
- Tactics?
- Yeah. I'm gonna keep acting tough...

1612
01:32:57,729 --> 01:32:59,891
...until I figure it out. All right?

1613
01:33:00,699 --> 01:33:02,291
See you on the track.

1614
01:33:02,501 --> 01:33:04,867
- Come on, baby.
- I love you.

1615
01:33:05,070 --> 01:33:06,731
I love you too. Come on.

1616
01:33:06,938 --> 01:33:08,907
Abracadabra, homes.

1617
01:33:13,012 --> 01:33:15,743
Hi, Bill Weber, along with
Wally Dallenbach and Benny Parsons.

1618
01:33:15,949 --> 01:33:19,577
Thanks for having us. Today,
Talladega, NASCAR's biggest track...

1619
01:33:19,785 --> 01:33:21,582
where the big concern
is the big wreck,

1620
01:33:21,787 --> 01:33:23,881
And it's not if it happens,
it's where and when,

1621
01:33:24,090 --> 01:33:27,217
We have a guy in the race today
that'll probably cause it, Ricky Bobby,

1622
01:33:27,426 --> 01:33:29,519
<i>Starting in the rear of the field,
underfunded</i>

1623
01:33:29,728 --> 01:33:32,254
and the last time we saw him,
he caused a big crash,

1624
01:33:32,465 --> 01:33:35,900
A lot of big stories and some
big questions here at Talladega,

1625
01:33:48,581 --> 01:33:50,913
All right, go get them.

1626
01:34:04,931 --> 01:34:06,922
You must decide, Ricky Bobby.

1627
01:34:07,133 --> 01:34:10,763
Is it foolish pride,
or is it greatness for you?

1628
01:34:18,946 --> 01:34:21,744
- Hey, Jarvis!
- Go ahead, Cal,

1629
01:34:21,949 --> 01:34:25,042
If you slept with
your best friend's wife...

1630
01:34:25,251 --> 01:34:28,915
...why would he apologize to you?
- Yeah, I know. That's weird.

1631
01:34:29,123 --> 01:34:32,853
That's what I'm saying.
My head's all tied up like a pretzel.

1632
01:34:33,059 --> 01:34:34,652
I got a pretzel in my head.

1633
01:34:39,467 --> 01:34:40,900
- Ricky!
- Come on, Dad!

1634
01:35:07,829 --> 01:35:09,558
I've got some big investors
coming by.

1635
01:35:09,764 --> 01:35:11,594
These guys are
big-money power players.

1636
01:35:11,799 --> 01:35:15,133
If things go right, they could have us
owning half the cars in NASCAR.

1637
01:35:15,337 --> 01:35:17,100
So I want you...
No, I want you to behave.

1638
01:35:17,305 --> 01:35:18,533
- Oh, really?
- Quiet.

1639
01:35:18,740 --> 01:35:21,038
Should I not tell them
after 14 years of marriage...

1640
01:35:21,243 --> 01:35:23,268
...you're still afraid
to let me see you naked?

1641
01:35:23,478 --> 01:35:25,469
That's not a fear thing,
it's a trust thing.

1642
01:35:26,047 --> 01:35:29,017
Hey! I was wondering
where you guys got off to.

1643
01:35:29,218 --> 01:35:31,310
Baby, this is Ted Beamen
from Halliburton.

1644
01:35:31,520 --> 01:35:33,545
- Nice to meet you.
- Over here...

1645
01:35:33,755 --> 01:35:36,554
...is Dick Tangfield
from Dynacorp.

1646
01:35:36,759 --> 01:35:38,727
- Back there is...
- You have beautiful teeth.

1647
01:35:38,928 --> 01:35:40,622
Yes, he does.
Get yourselves down there.

1648
01:35:40,829 --> 01:35:42,490
- Adorable.
- Make yourselves at home...

1649
01:35:42,697 --> 01:35:46,099
...grab something to eat, over here...
- Sweetheart, sweetheart.

1650
01:35:46,302 --> 01:35:47,769
You're a sweetie pie.

1651
01:35:47,970 --> 01:35:50,733
She's very affectionate.
She suffered a recent loss...

1652
01:35:50,939 --> 01:35:52,237
You taste good too.

1653
01:35:52,441 --> 01:35:54,306
So she's a little emotional.

1654
01:35:54,510 --> 01:35:58,775
Okay, that's fine. Go ahead, find a seat.
Can we get these guys something?

1655
01:35:59,014 --> 01:36:02,246
Jean Girard started from the pole
and is out to a big lead,

1656
01:36:02,451 --> 01:36:04,783
As you know, Bill,
he's been doing that all year,

1657
01:36:07,256 --> 01:36:11,886
Where are you, Ricky Bobby?
Come face your destroyer!

1658
01:36:12,094 --> 01:36:14,562
"Come face your destroyer"?
Listen to how I sound.

1659
01:36:14,764 --> 01:36:16,630
I sound like a massive prick.

1660
01:36:18,768 --> 01:36:20,360
Come on, baby! Yeah, that's it.

1661
01:36:20,570 --> 01:36:23,368
All right, Lucius.
Time to let the cougar loose.

1662
01:36:25,842 --> 01:36:27,672
Here we go, boys.

1663
01:36:35,285 --> 01:36:37,809
<i>Ricky Bobby, in the 62 car,
on the move,</i>

1664
01:36:38,020 --> 01:36:40,182
He's gone from 26th to 18th place.

1665
01:36:40,390 --> 01:36:44,019
Now let's go to John Hannafin, in the
stands with a country-music legend.

1666
01:36:44,228 --> 01:36:47,425
Thank you, Sean. I'm here with one
of the greatest country-music stars...

1667
01:36:47,631 --> 01:36:49,326
...of all time, Kenny Rogers.

1668
01:36:49,533 --> 01:36:53,492
- What do you think of the race so far?
- It's good. They're going really fast.

1669
01:36:53,704 --> 01:36:55,763
John, that's not Kenny Rogers.

1670
01:36:55,973 --> 01:36:58,464
In the song "The Gambler,"
you sang:

1671
01:36:58,675 --> 01:37:01,803
"You gotta know when to walk away
and know when to run."

1672
01:37:02,012 --> 01:37:04,447
Should Ricky Bobby have
stayed away from racing?

1673
01:37:04,648 --> 01:37:09,813
Mr. Bobby's very competitive.
If he wants to race, he should race.

1674
01:37:10,187 --> 01:37:13,954
Well, this is John Hannafin with Kenny
Rogers. And now back to you, Bill.

1675
01:37:14,157 --> 01:37:16,091
Well, that, of course,
was not Kenny Rogers.

1676
01:37:16,293 --> 01:37:17,260
Not even close.

1677
01:37:18,295 --> 01:37:20,423
Ricky, you've got Brian Wavecrest...

1678
01:37:20,665 --> 01:37:23,031
the guy that replaced you
at Dennit, dead ahead,

1679
01:37:23,268 --> 01:37:25,963
Bobby working really hard to pass
the Wonder Bread car,

1680
01:37:26,169 --> 01:37:27,933
That's his old ride, of course,

1681
01:37:34,479 --> 01:37:36,913
We've passed the halfway mark
with Ricky Bobby

1682
01:37:37,115 --> 01:37:40,107
now three car lengths
behind the leader,

1683
01:37:40,351 --> 01:37:43,514
Maybe subconsciously
you slept with Ricky's wife...

1684
01:37:43,721 --> 01:37:45,416
as a way of getting back at him

1685
01:37:45,623 --> 01:37:48,387
for making you
come in second all those years,

1686
01:37:48,626 --> 01:37:52,790
I know one thing, Carley was definitely
unconscious every time we had sex.

1687
01:37:54,465 --> 01:37:56,626
Lucius, I got Cal Naughton
dead ahead of me.

1688
01:38:00,039 --> 01:38:02,802
Hey, Cal, you should pay attention,
I think he's passing you,

1689
01:38:03,007 --> 01:38:05,168
Is Ricky passing me
in my subconscious?

1690
01:38:05,376 --> 01:38:08,210
No, he's actually passing you,
That's happening right now,

1691
01:38:08,747 --> 01:38:10,977
Go, Ricky! Go!

1692
01:38:11,182 --> 01:38:12,740
Let's go back to our
John Hannafin

1693
01:38:12,950 --> 01:38:16,409
...who's in the stands
with an NBA legend, Larry Bird.

1694
01:38:16,622 --> 01:38:19,056
Folks, I'm here with one of the great
NBA superstars...

1695
01:38:19,258 --> 01:38:20,986
...a real legend, Larry Bird.

1696
01:38:21,192 --> 01:38:24,356
I almost didn't recognize you with
the sunglasses. What are you up to?

1697
01:38:24,563 --> 01:38:26,190
Come on, John, pay attention.

1698
01:38:26,398 --> 01:38:28,525
I'm concerned,
He might have had a stroke,

1699
01:38:28,734 --> 01:38:31,225
Didn't Ricky Bobby used to
drive for you?

1700
01:38:31,437 --> 01:38:33,371
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
- He's doing quite well.

1701
01:38:33,572 --> 01:38:36,564
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Richard!

1702
01:38:37,444 --> 01:38:39,877
Get Cal Naughton's crew chief
on the radio right away.

1703
01:38:41,714 --> 01:38:45,913
I believe you have some tickets waiting
for me. My name's Reese Bobby.

1704
01:38:46,119 --> 01:38:47,677
Reese Bobby.

1705
01:38:49,121 --> 01:38:52,557
Mister, these tickets have been waiting
for you for a long time.

1706
01:38:59,732 --> 01:39:02,031
Who needs two? I got tickets!

1707
01:39:02,235 --> 01:39:04,294
Tickets, right here, 60 bucks a pop.

1708
01:39:11,578 --> 01:39:15,912
All right, Girard, I found you.
Now let's see where this goes.

1709
01:39:16,116 --> 01:39:17,607
Bobby's gotten around Naughton

1710
01:39:17,817 --> 01:39:21,378
and now he's right behind Girard,
but Girard's gonna block the track,

1711
01:39:21,588 --> 01:39:23,613
Man, he's scary good,

1712
01:39:23,823 --> 01:39:25,951
Ah, Ricky Bobby.

1713
01:39:26,160 --> 01:39:30,721
Now we shall dance,
and yes, it will be a slow jam.

1714
01:39:36,970 --> 01:39:39,302
Damn it. Come on, man.

1715
01:39:42,209 --> 01:39:44,609
I was wrong about you, Ricky Bobby.

1716
01:39:44,812 --> 01:39:47,245
You are not the one to defeat me.

1717
01:39:51,085 --> 01:39:52,416
I can't get around him, man.

1718
01:39:56,690 --> 01:39:59,090
You tell Cal Naughton
to take Ricky Bobby out.

1719
01:39:59,293 --> 01:40:03,287
Hey, Cal, listen. I hate to add
to your tremendous moral confusion...

1720
01:40:03,498 --> 01:40:04,931
...but I just heard from Dennit.

1721
01:40:05,133 --> 01:40:08,192
He said to take Ricky Bobby
out of the race or you're fired, buddy.

1722
01:40:08,402 --> 01:40:09,767
What are you talking about?

1723
01:40:09,970 --> 01:40:13,668
Tell him if he doesn't do it, he's done.
That's right, he'll be driving a tour bus.

1724
01:40:13,875 --> 01:40:18,311
Well, you tell Mr. Dennit that
Ricky Bobby is my best friend.

1725
01:40:18,512 --> 01:40:21,311
- And it's Shake and Bake time.
- Cal, I don't like the way...

1726
01:40:21,516 --> 01:40:24,951
...you're talking out there.
- Damn the torpedoes!

1727
01:40:33,161 --> 01:40:37,325
Come on, man, slingshot it.
Slingshot, come on.

1728
01:40:37,532 --> 01:40:40,660
I can't believe it.
If it isn't Mike Honcho himself.

1729
01:40:40,869 --> 01:40:42,234
Shake and Bake, buddy!

1730
01:40:42,437 --> 01:40:44,337
Shake it before you bake it.

1731
01:40:45,240 --> 01:40:48,835
Here I come. Slingshot engaged.

1732
01:40:51,914 --> 01:40:53,505
Yeah!

1733
01:40:54,282 --> 01:40:55,840
I love you, Cal!

1734
01:40:56,051 --> 01:40:58,850
- What are you doing?
- Can't believe it, Now I've seen it all,

1735
01:40:59,055 --> 01:41:03,821
Cal Naughton from Dennit Racing just
helped a rival driver pass a teammate,

1736
01:41:05,861 --> 01:41:10,060
Darrell, you tell Brian Wavecrest
to take out Cal Naughton right now.

1737
01:41:10,266 --> 01:41:12,699
Right now, you do it. You do it!

1738
01:41:13,368 --> 01:41:14,666
Yes, sir.

1739
01:41:22,278 --> 01:41:25,338
<i>And the 26 car just ran Naughton
into the wall,</i>

1740
01:41:31,387 --> 01:41:32,911
Oh, man.

1741
01:41:38,795 --> 01:41:40,625
Damn you, Wavecrest!

1742
01:41:44,300 --> 01:41:48,533
The entire field was in that wreck,
and we've only got six laps to go,

1743
01:41:48,739 --> 01:41:51,571
Only Ricky Bobby and Jean Girard
got away clean,

1744
01:41:54,144 --> 01:41:56,578
It's just Jean and Ricky.

1745
01:42:01,018 --> 01:42:05,580
And now the matador shall dance
with the blind shoemaker.

1746
01:42:07,724 --> 01:42:10,852
Race officials have completed
an extensive cleanup of the track,

1747
01:42:11,061 --> 01:42:12,551
We're ready to get back to racing,

1748
01:42:12,763 --> 01:42:16,164
The 200,000 fans are on their feet,
and the green flag is in the air,

1749
01:42:25,476 --> 01:42:28,035
Bobby and Girard are
dueling each other for the lead,

1750
01:42:28,245 --> 01:42:30,509
No one seems to have the edge,

1751
01:42:30,714 --> 01:42:32,808
Go, go, go! Come on, come on, go!

1752
01:42:33,017 --> 01:42:35,611
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is the final lap,

1753
01:42:38,889 --> 01:42:42,758
By the way, Ricky,
I watched the Highlander movie.

1754
01:42:42,961 --> 01:42:44,326
It was shit.

1755
01:42:46,197 --> 01:42:48,688
Hang on, baby Jesus,
this is gonna get bumpy.

1756
01:43:15,393 --> 01:43:17,418
I've seen a lot of big crashes
at Talladega

1757
01:43:17,629 --> 01:43:19,655
but this is the longest one
I've ever seen,

1758
01:43:19,865 --> 01:43:22,527
Let's take a quick commercial break
and we'll be right back,

1759
01:43:22,735 --> 01:43:24,760
Hungry for both steak and shrimp?

1760
01:43:32,511 --> 01:43:36,345
Welcome back to Talladega,
where the long one continues,

1761
01:43:43,623 --> 01:43:47,752
No, no! Jean Girard and Ricky Bobby
have wrecked in the last lap...

1762
01:43:47,960 --> 01:43:49,723
on the straightaway,
What a shame,

1763
01:43:49,928 --> 01:43:51,556
Oh, God.

1764
01:43:52,799 --> 01:43:56,564
It looks like neither Girard or Bobby
will finish this race,

1765
01:43:56,769 --> 01:43:59,967
We'd like to thank you for joining us
for NBC's coverage of NAS CAR,

1766
01:44:00,173 --> 01:44:03,198
Coming up next,
it's Ice Dancing to the Hits of Motown,

1767
01:44:22,796 --> 01:44:25,697
Wait a minute, there's something
going on on the track down there.

1768
01:44:25,899 --> 01:44:28,094
Oh, my God,
they're racing each other on foot,

1769
01:44:28,301 --> 01:44:29,700
These men will not quit,

1770
01:44:29,903 --> 01:44:31,962
Go! Go!

1771
01:44:34,507 --> 01:44:37,237
Ricky, Ricky. He's going,
he's going, he's going. Look!

1772
01:45:14,782 --> 01:45:16,443
He did it!

1773
01:45:23,124 --> 01:45:25,252
Well, I'll be damned.

1774
01:45:26,595 --> 01:45:28,721
Good for you, Ricky Bobby.

1775
01:45:34,603 --> 01:45:36,798
Yeah! Yeah!

1776
01:45:37,005 --> 01:45:38,335
Ricky Bobby wins!

1777
01:45:38,539 --> 01:45:41,100
You'll never see anything like that
in a hundred lifetimes.

1778
01:45:41,309 --> 01:45:44,904
It was completely illegal and in no way
will count, but that was something.

1779
01:45:45,113 --> 01:45:47,512
It was, That was really good,

1780
01:45:50,051 --> 01:45:53,612
Monsieur Bobby,
by defeating me today...

1781
01:45:53,822 --> 01:45:56,290
...you have set me free.

1782
01:45:56,492 --> 01:45:58,959
And for that, I thank you.

1783
01:46:00,996 --> 01:46:04,694
I will never shake your hand, ever.

1784
01:46:06,469 --> 01:46:08,766
But I will give you this.

1785
01:46:29,959 --> 01:46:34,794
Sir, you taste of America.

1786
01:46:36,065 --> 01:46:37,965
Thank you.

1787
01:46:43,039 --> 01:46:46,065
No, once was good. Once was good.

1788
01:46:50,513 --> 01:46:53,381
Boy, that Halliburton.
Halliburton's taken off, haven't they?

1789
01:46:53,584 --> 01:46:54,982
Yeah, yeah, we're doing well.

1790
01:46:55,184 --> 01:46:57,914
Now there's some stock
I'd like to get my hands on.

1791
01:46:58,120 --> 01:47:00,112
Ladies and gentlemen,
NASCAR fans...

1792
01:47:00,324 --> 01:47:02,918
...your eyes on Talladega's
famed Victory Lane...

1793
01:47:03,126 --> 01:47:04,990
...as we get ready
for trophy time here...

1794
01:47:05,194 --> 01:47:08,323
...following an exciting running
of the Talladega 500.

1795
01:47:08,532 --> 01:47:10,796
First, a very brief explanation.

1796
01:47:11,001 --> 01:47:15,461
Because the drivers that finished
first and second got out of their cars...

1797
01:47:15,672 --> 01:47:18,163
...they have officially
been disqualified.

1798
01:47:18,375 --> 01:47:22,106
So now the winner, he was third,
he's now number one:

1799
01:47:22,778 --> 01:47:26,112
Cal Naughton Jr.!

1800
01:47:27,317 --> 01:47:28,978
Yeah, come on, guys!

1801
01:47:31,556 --> 01:47:34,547
- Give me that thing.
- Cal, you're number one!

1802
01:47:34,758 --> 01:47:37,283
I've been waiting a long time for you
to say my name, man.

1803
01:47:37,494 --> 01:47:40,658
I know it's a technicality,
but I tell you what...

1804
01:47:40,865 --> 01:47:44,095
...you try to take this away from me,
I'll sock you in the face.

1805
01:47:44,301 --> 01:47:46,098
Ricky.

1806
01:47:46,303 --> 01:47:47,965
Give me that thing.

1807
01:47:50,842 --> 01:47:54,038
I can't believe it. I can't believe it!

1808
01:47:54,679 --> 01:47:57,477
- Cal!
- Put me down.

1809
01:47:57,715 --> 01:47:59,307
I'm proud of you!

1810
01:47:59,517 --> 01:48:03,078
Get up here, man.
No, you come up here.

1811
01:48:03,288 --> 01:48:04,687
You come up here.

1812
01:48:07,892 --> 01:48:10,258
- Cal Naughton! Cal Naughton.
- Oh, my God.

1813
01:48:10,461 --> 01:48:13,362
For this to happen...
Am I dead, man?

1814
01:48:13,564 --> 01:48:15,862
You won the Talladega 500,
all right?

1815
01:48:17,335 --> 01:48:18,860
I owe you an apology.

1816
01:48:19,338 --> 01:48:21,771
- Come on.
- Man, I'm sorry about Carley.

1817
01:48:21,973 --> 01:48:24,874
She walked straight up to me
and grabbed me in the crotch.

1818
01:48:25,076 --> 01:48:28,513
- It's like a tractor beam of hotness.
- I know.

1819
01:48:29,881 --> 01:48:31,781
Shake and Bake?

1820
01:48:33,151 --> 01:48:36,280
No. Never again.

1821
01:48:38,290 --> 01:48:42,659
You're right.
I was a total dick, man.

1822
01:48:42,861 --> 01:48:44,920
From now on...

1823
01:48:46,198 --> 01:48:48,290
...it's Magic Man...

1824
01:48:48,499 --> 01:48:50,024
...and El Diablo.

1825
01:48:51,036 --> 01:48:52,731
What's "Diablo" mean?

1826
01:48:52,938 --> 01:48:54,132
It's like, you know...

1827
01:48:54,340 --> 01:48:56,535
It's like Spanish for,
like, a fighting chicken.

1828
01:48:56,742 --> 01:48:58,141
- That's awesome.
- I know.

1829
01:48:58,344 --> 01:49:01,404
- With the claws.
- With the claws and the beak.

1830
01:49:01,613 --> 01:49:03,012
Where did you think of that?

1831
01:49:03,215 --> 01:49:04,842
You just... Sometimes things click.

1832
01:49:05,452 --> 01:49:07,885
- I love you, bro.
- I love you too.

1833
01:49:09,455 --> 01:49:13,324
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God, I can't believe it!

1834
01:49:14,194 --> 01:49:17,560
Excuse me, guys. Nice job.

1835
01:49:17,763 --> 01:49:19,128
Hey, Ricky.

1836
01:49:19,631 --> 01:49:20,929
Hey, Carley.

1837
01:49:21,134 --> 01:49:24,831
I've decided I can love you again.
You're a winner.

1838
01:49:25,305 --> 01:49:27,602
- Yeah, I don't think so.
- Really?

1839
01:49:27,806 --> 01:49:32,801
Are you prepared to walk away
from these pearls...

1840
01:49:34,047 --> 01:49:35,309
...of delight?

1841
01:49:39,786 --> 01:49:43,415
Well... Yeah, this is tough.
How would it work?

1842
01:49:43,623 --> 01:49:45,352
- Would Cal move out?
- Yep, gone.

1843
01:49:45,558 --> 01:49:47,651
Kids move back in?

1844
01:49:47,861 --> 01:49:50,955
- Can I just have a little refresher?
- Of course, baby.

1845
01:49:52,533 --> 01:49:54,501
This is why you fell in love,
don't forget.

1846
01:49:54,702 --> 01:49:56,965
Yeah, I'm in.
I'm moving in right now.

1847
01:49:57,170 --> 01:49:59,070
I'll drive 100 miles an hour
to your house.

1848
01:49:59,272 --> 01:50:01,002
- Our house. Our house.
- Our house, yeah.

1849
01:50:01,208 --> 01:50:03,472
No, I'm not. Come on.
It's gonna be awkward.

1850
01:50:03,677 --> 01:50:05,234
- Hey, baby.
- Hey.

1851
01:50:07,414 --> 01:50:09,144
Wait a minute.

1852
01:50:09,417 --> 01:50:12,580
You are ready to walk away...

1853
01:50:12,787 --> 01:50:16,416
...from FHM magazine's
number seven hottest ass...

1854
01:50:16,624 --> 01:50:20,424
...for the girl who forgets
to get your dry cleaning?

1855
01:50:20,628 --> 01:50:22,061
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

1856
01:50:22,396 --> 01:50:25,024
- Yeah.
- Good luck, weirdoes.

1857
01:50:25,232 --> 01:50:26,995
- Carley, come back here.
- Yes, Susie Q?

1858
01:50:27,201 --> 01:50:30,170
There's something I've wanted
to tell you for a really long time.

1859
01:50:31,440 --> 01:50:34,602
Thank you. Maybe one together?

1860
01:50:35,709 --> 01:50:38,678
- Susie Q, are those real?
- Yeah.

1861
01:50:38,879 --> 01:50:41,747
Well, girl, you got some game.

1862
01:50:43,517 --> 01:50:45,451
- We'll see you on down the road.
- Yeah.

1863
01:50:45,653 --> 01:50:47,485
- You seen Cal?
- He's somewhere around here.

1864
01:50:47,689 --> 01:50:50,715
Hey, Cal! Baby, I'm coming.
Thanks, baby.

1865
01:50:51,726 --> 01:50:54,319
- Maybe one more?
- Oh, boys.

1866
01:50:54,528 --> 01:50:56,019
- She's crazy.
- Oh, thank you.

1867
01:50:56,364 --> 01:50:57,854
- You did good.
- Thanks, Mama.

1868
01:50:58,066 --> 01:50:59,499
He's amazing.

1869
01:50:59,701 --> 01:51:01,759
That was one heck of a day,
I gotta say.

1870
01:51:01,969 --> 01:51:04,768
That's some nice driving there,
cowboy.

1871
01:51:04,973 --> 01:51:07,737
- Hey, Daddy.
- Well, hello, Reese.

1872
01:51:07,943 --> 01:51:12,471
Well, if it isn't our old
mangy, transient grandfather.

1873
01:51:12,914 --> 01:51:15,610
Well said, grandson.
Take that as a compliment.

1874
01:51:15,817 --> 01:51:18,946
Hey, Ricky,
let me ask you a question.

1875
01:51:21,923 --> 01:51:23,550
Who did you win that race for?

1876
01:51:23,792 --> 01:51:25,919
Well, I sure as hell didn't
win it for you.

1877
01:51:26,462 --> 01:51:27,986
I like hearing that.

1878
01:51:29,065 --> 01:51:31,555
I guess if I really gotta think about it...

1879
01:51:32,100 --> 01:51:34,763
...I just went out there and drove.

1880
01:51:34,971 --> 01:51:37,132
And knew that no matter
what happened...

1881
01:51:37,807 --> 01:51:43,302
...my boys, my mama,
and my lady would love me.

1882
01:51:44,614 --> 01:51:47,583
Hi, I'm his lady, I'm Susan.

1883
01:51:47,783 --> 01:51:50,513
I painted the car, I...
We had sex.

1884
01:51:50,720 --> 01:51:52,654
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

1885
01:51:52,855 --> 01:51:54,823
Well, I wish I could've
been there for that.

1886
01:51:55,024 --> 01:51:57,458
Son, I'm proud of you.

1887
01:51:58,961 --> 01:52:03,398
Yep. Yeah, I think...
I guess things are...

1888
01:52:04,534 --> 01:52:06,662
...just pretty much perfect right now.

1889
01:52:08,604 --> 01:52:10,572
It's making me a little itchy.

1890
01:52:12,441 --> 01:52:15,707
Well, what do you say
we get thrown out of an Applebee's?

1891
01:52:15,913 --> 01:52:18,278
- That sound like a good idea?
- You read my mind, son.

1892
01:52:18,481 --> 01:52:20,972
- You can cuss at Applebee's.
- Everybody pile in.

1893
01:52:21,185 --> 01:52:22,982
How does one get thrown out
of Applebee's?

1894
01:52:23,187 --> 01:52:25,712
- You're about to find out.
- Okay.

1895
01:52:25,923 --> 01:52:27,856
Watch, the doors actually open.

1896
01:52:59,189 --> 01:53:01,715
- Hey, I'm Ricky Bobby.
- And I'm Cal Naughton Jr.

1897
01:53:01,926 --> 01:53:05,190
We just want to take a moment to talk
to you about snow blindness in cats.

1898
01:53:05,395 --> 01:53:07,659
It's affecting more and more cats
every year.

1899
01:53:07,864 --> 01:53:10,425
And it scares the living shit out of us.

1900
01:53:11,736 --> 01:53:14,499
Ninety-eight percent of us will die
at some point in our lives.

1901
01:53:14,705 --> 01:53:17,573
The darkness is creeping towards you,
whether you know it or not.

1902
01:53:17,775 --> 01:53:19,367
A little planning can go a long way.

1903
01:53:19,577 --> 01:53:21,545
Listen, leaving
your big old corpse behind...

1904
01:53:21,746 --> 01:53:23,805
...for your loved ones to deal with
ain't cool.

1905
01:53:24,015 --> 01:53:26,415
That's why you should call
McCreedy Funeral Service.

1906
01:53:26,751 --> 01:53:30,414
McCreedy's.
They'll find the hole and build the box.

1907
01:53:30,622 --> 01:53:34,023
Bodies that look so good,
you're gonna wanna talk to it.

1908
01:53:37,562 --> 01:53:39,827
We like to have a lot of laughs
on the racetrack...

1909
01:53:40,032 --> 01:53:42,296
...but today we wanna talk
about something serious:

1910
01:53:42,501 --> 01:53:46,664
Packs of stray dogs that control
most of the major cities.

1911
01:53:48,641 --> 01:53:52,633
That's packs of wild, vicious dogs
that are controlling most of...

1912
01:53:52,844 --> 01:53:53,811
Sorry.

1913
01:53:54,345 --> 01:53:57,338
I like to picture Jesus
like a mischievous badger.

1914
01:53:57,616 --> 01:53:59,607
Like a muscular trapeze artist.

1915
01:53:59,885 --> 01:54:03,218
Like a shapeshifter or a changeling,
like that guy.

1916
01:54:03,422 --> 01:54:05,083
You ever hear of
that TV show Manimal?

1917
01:54:05,324 --> 01:54:08,350
I like to think of Jesus
as a figure skater...

1918
01:54:08,560 --> 01:54:10,221
...who wears, like, a white outfit...

1919
01:54:10,429 --> 01:54:13,887
...and he does interpretive ice dances
of my life's journey.

1920
01:54:14,133 --> 01:54:16,067
Like a dirty old bum.

1921
01:54:16,268 --> 01:54:19,534
He comes up to me, I'm about to sock
him one because he's a dirty old bum.

1922
01:54:19,739 --> 01:54:22,172
Then I said, "Wait a minute,
I better not sock this guy.

1923
01:54:22,374 --> 01:54:23,636
Something special about him."

1924
01:54:23,876 --> 01:54:26,140
- Yeah, and it turns out it's Jesus.
- Yeah.

1925
01:54:26,578 --> 01:54:28,706
One, two... Oh, God.

1926
01:54:28,915 --> 01:54:32,281
- Not again! No go. No go!
- It's stuck. It's stuck.

1927
01:54:32,785 --> 01:54:34,377
We got two knives in my leg.

1928
01:54:34,587 --> 01:54:37,886
I know, but one is a safety knife.
One is a safety.

1929
01:54:40,192 --> 01:54:41,625
It's coming out.
It's coming out.

1930
01:54:41,827 --> 01:54:43,261
I'm choking on my own spit.

1931
01:54:43,463 --> 01:54:46,023
It hurts so bad
I'm choking on my own spit.

1932
01:54:46,299 --> 01:54:48,665
Good night, guys.
I'm losing a lot of blood.

1933
01:54:48,868 --> 01:54:50,665
- Just relax, man.
- Good night.

1934
01:54:50,870 --> 01:54:53,395
Ricky! Wake...

1935
01:54:55,075 --> 01:55:00,103
Sometimes, when it's late at night,
I dress up like Donna Summers.

1936
01:55:00,313 --> 01:55:04,943
You know, I put on the skirt
and the four-inch heels, man.

1937
01:55:05,185 --> 01:55:06,517
I love it.

1938
01:55:16,230 --> 01:55:18,094
Sorry. Sorry.

1939
01:55:19,766 --> 01:55:22,964
I would be honored if you would
let me sign your cast.

1940
01:55:23,170 --> 01:55:25,695
And I would be honored
if you'd sign my balls.

1941
01:55:25,906 --> 01:55:28,373
- Oh, baby, that is a good one.
- Hey, what are you doing?

1942
02:00:45,800 --> 02:00:49,201
"Don't touch a one of them.
They're mine."

1943
02:00:51,806 --> 02:00:54,775
So, what do you think
that story was about?

1944
02:00:54,975 --> 02:00:57,773
Doesn't the bear symbolize
the old South...

1945
02:00:57,978 --> 02:01:02,074
...and the new dog, the encroaching
industrialization of the North?

1946
02:01:02,283 --> 02:01:07,187
Duh. But the question is, should
the reader feel relief or sadness...

1947
02:01:07,389 --> 02:01:08,981
...at the passing of the old South?

1948
02:01:09,191 --> 02:01:10,817
Well, how about both?

1949
02:01:11,025 --> 02:01:14,017
Oh, I get it. Moral ambiguity.

1950
02:01:14,228 --> 02:01:18,563
The hallmark of all early
20th-century American fiction.

1951
02:01:18,767 --> 02:01:21,633
- Great analysis, Walker.
- Thank you.
