1
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:51,716
Thank you, thank you

2
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:52,740
thank you

3
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:54,540
I'd like to begin.

4
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:57,210
I like to... thank you, thank you.

5
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:03,260
I'd like to begin by saying fuck Lance Armstrong.

6
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:09,766
Fuck him and his balls

7
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:11,726
and his bicycles and his steroids

8
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:12,980
and his yellow shirts

9
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,456
and the dumb empty expression on his face

10
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,250
I'm tired of that asshole

11
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:20,436
and while you're at it

12
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:22,520
fuck Tiger Woods too

13
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:29,480
there's another jackoff I can do without.

14
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,566
I'm tired of being told who to admire in this country

15
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:37,246
aren't you sick of being told who your heroes ought to be

16
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:38,356
you know.

17
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:41,076
Being told who you oughta be looking up to

18
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,686
I'll choose my own heroes thank you very much

19
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:46,280
and fuck Dr. Phil too.

20
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:59,256
Dr. Phil said I should express my emotions

21
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,280
so that's what I'm doing.

22
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,856
Now since the last time I rolled through these parts

23
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:08,236
and I do roll through with some frequency

24
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:09,526
I'm a little bit like herpes

25
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:11,300
I keep coming back

26
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:15,166
but since the last time I might have seen some of you folks

27
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:17,750
I have had my 70th birthday

28
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:21,460
thank you very much, thank you

29
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,390
thank you.

30
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,136
Yeah, I'm now 70 years old

31
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,496
and I like 70

32
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,950
not as much as I like 69.

33
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:34,600
Well, 69 was always my favorite number

34
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:38,700
not I figure I'm 69 with one finger up my ass

35
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:47,440
but now that I'm an old fuck

36
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:50,826
and that's what I consider myself to be

37
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:51,860
an old fuck

38
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,396
old fuck is a very special term

39
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:55,756
it's not like old man

40
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:57,316
old man is different.

41
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:00,856
Old man isn't really a time in your life or a period of years

42
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,036
it's an attitude

43
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:04,986
old man is a point of view, it's a way of looking at things

44
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:07,506
some guys are old men when they're in their 20s

45
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:08,596
you've met guys like that

46
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:10,596
they're just wired like old men

47
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:11,346
not me

48
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:12,247
not an old man

49
00:03:12,271 --> 00:03:13,436
and not an old fart

50
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:14,636
'cause an old fart is kinda

51
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:16,870
(grumbling like an old fart)

52
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:19,760
what I am is an old fuck

53
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:22,316
it's kind of like a fat fuck.

54
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:24,316
You know what I mean.

55
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:26,890
Fat fuck, tall fuck, skinny fuck, short fuck.

56
00:03:27,236 --> 00:03:28,236
Old fuck

57
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:29,166
who's the old fuck

58
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:29,947
that's Georgie.

59
00:03:29,971 --> 00:03:31,970
Georgie's the old fuck

60
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:33,886
in this respect

61
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:37,010
fuck is actually a synonym for the word "fellow"

62
00:03:39,906 --> 00:03:41,026
but now that I'm an old fuck

63
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:44,996
I'm beginning to notice there are some advantages to putting on a few extra years

64
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:46,540
the first one is

65
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:49,340
you never have to carry anything heavy ever again

66
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:52,840
everybody wants to help an old fuck

67
00:03:53,686 --> 00:03:55,606
if you got a big suitcase or something like that

68
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:57,436
you know you just kinda go like this a little bit

69
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:59,037
you say, "could you help me with this?"

70
00:03:59,061 --> 00:04:00,661
he says, "yeah, how far are you going?"

71
00:04:00,685 --> 00:04:01,954
"Indianapolis."

72
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:04,366
He wants to help?

73
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:06,390
Fuck him, put him to work

74
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,340
take advantage of people

75
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,186
now, thing I see about getting old is

76
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:13,560
you can leave any social event early

77
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:16,060
just by saying you're tired

78
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:20,156
works great with family members

79
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:21,976
just turn to the person next to you and say,

80
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,430
"Geez, I'm getting tired, you know?"

81
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,856
Oh, you're tired? Come on.

82
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,856
Grandpa's tired, grandpa's going to bed.

83
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:30,340
Someone else says, "but it's 7:30 in the morning"

84
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:34,790
there's always one asshole in the family

85
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:37,956
but the best thing about getting old is

86
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:41,280
you're not responsible for remembering things anymore

87
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:43,876
even important things.

88
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:46,350
"But it was your daughter's funeral."

89
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:51,610
"I forgot."

90
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,936
You can even make-believe you have Alzheimer's disease.

91
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,936
That's a lot of fun

92
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,826
you look around the dining room table

93
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:02,130
and you say, "who're you people and where's my horse?"

94
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:07,016
then you stare at your eldest son

95
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,980
and say, "Agnes, I haven't seen you since first communion"

96
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,550
fucks them up

97
00:05:13,417 --> 00:05:14,417
fucks them up

98
00:05:14,441 --> 00:05:15,990
they don't know how to handle it

99
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:18,120
takes them a week to get over that shit

100
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:22,620
and they start listening to you a lot more carefully from then on

101
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:24,576
so don't be afraid to get old

102
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,856
it's a great time of life

103
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,656
you get to take advantage of people

104
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,920
and you're not responsible for anything

105
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:33,020
you can even shit in your pants

106
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:41,700
they expect it.

107
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:44,756
I haven't tried that yet

108
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:46,780
but I don't rule it out.

109
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:49,656
I'm keeping my options open

110
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,290
everything is on the table

111
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:58,070
perhaps that's not the figure of speech I wanted right there

112
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:00,526
so you know what I've been doing

113
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:03,720
going through my address book and crossing out the dead people

114
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:06,876
you do that? That's a lot of fun, isn't it?

115
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,056
Gives you a good feeling

116
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,080
kind of gives you a feeling of power

117
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:14,080
the superiority to have outlasted another old friend

118
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,666
but you can't do it too soon you know?

119
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:18,406
You can't do it too soon

120
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:22,570
you can't come running out from the funeral and get the book out you know?

121
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:24,216
You can't do that

122
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,926
a little time has to pass

123
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:27,796
you have to let a little time go by

124
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:30,080
I have a rule of thumb: Six weeks

125
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:33,196
if you're a friend of mine and you're in my book and you die

126
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:35,766
I leave you along for an extra six weeks

127
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:38,940
six extra weeks in the book on the house it's on me

128
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:42,846
but after that, hey! Facts are facts, fuck you, you're dead

129
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:47,540
pfffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff

130
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:49,680
out you fucking go!

131
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,920
You gotta have standards you know?

132
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:58,256
Now these days a lot of people don't keep analog address books anymore

133
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:00,590
they don't want to be writing that stuff out longhand

134
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:02,076
they're in the computer age

135
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:05,116
and they have an application in the computer called outlook

136
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:07,896
contacts or address book something like that

137
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:10,536
so they keep all the information in the computer

138
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,236
and they sync it up with their phone every day or every other day

139
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:15,816
so now, instead of scratching out a name

140
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,840
you get to delete the fuck

141
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,720
and deleting someone is an even more powerful feeling

142
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,136
than simply scratching out a name

143
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,816
you know how to delete someone

144
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,606
you select the name

145
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:30,606
highlight the person

146
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:32,630
and then poufff

147
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:36,060
fwiishh straight into the trash

148
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:39,626
now if it's a really close friend of yours

149
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:42,620
you might not want to empty the trash for about six weeks

150
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:47,376
or or

151
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,836
if it's a little too harsh for you

152
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:52,556
a little too harsh to delete an old friend

153
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:55,460
you can always create a new folder

154
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,160
a special folder for dead people

155
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,700
you keep it on your desktop

156
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:05,900
it's kind of a digital purgatory

157
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:18,386
and, and the nice thing

158
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:21,171
is that every now and then you can open it up and you can look inside

159
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:23,176
you can see the people in purgatory

160
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,496
and you can move them all around

161
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:25,796
you know, move them around

162
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:27,046
put them in little groups

163
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:28,630
two people who didn't get along in life

164
00:08:28,654 --> 00:08:30,374
put them in the corner let them work it out

165
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:31,816
let them work it out in purgatory

166
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:32,560
or start a fight

167
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,436
have a big fight in purgatory

168
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:35,407
nobody's gonna get hurt

169
00:08:35,431 --> 00:08:36,980
they're all fucking dead anyway

170
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:41,980
then you put them in a big formation and have a parade

171
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:45,280
the purgatory parade of dead people

172
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:48,890
ah, there's a lot of fun you can have with a computer

173
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:52,250
so enjoy your digital selves

174
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:54,880
now speaking of dead people

175
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:57,626
there are things we say

176
00:08:57,650 --> 00:08:58,876
when someone dies

177
00:08:58,900 --> 00:08:59,856
most of us say

178
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:00,817
lot of us do

179
00:09:00,841 --> 00:09:03,316
things we say that no one ever questions

180
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:05,316
they just kind of go unexamined

181
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:06,740
give you a couple of examples

182
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,826
uh, after someone dies

183
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:11,706
the following conversation is bound to take place

184
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:13,706
probably more than once

185
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:15,336
two guys meet on the street

186
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,656
"hey did you hear?"

187
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,166
"Phil Davies died."

188
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:19,456
"Phil Davies?"

189
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,480
"I just saw him yesterday."

190
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:23,660
"Yeah?"

191
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:26,160
"Didn't help."

192
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:29,670
"He died anyways."

193
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:34,930
Apparently, the simple act of your seeing him did not slow his cancer down

194
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:38,270
in fact, it may have made it more aggressive

195
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:42,470
you know, you could be responsible for Phil's death

196
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:45,560
how do you live with yourself?

197
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:49,376
Here's another thing they say after a death

198
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,696
this is usually said

199
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,696
to the surviving spouse

200
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,536
listen, if there's anything I could do

201
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,296
anything at all

202
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:00,250
please don't hesitate to ask.

203
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,450
What are you gonna do, a resurrection?

204
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:06,610
This ain't the fucking New Testament you know

205
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:09,016
you know what you tell a guy like that who wants to help

206
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,800
well fine, why don't you come over this week

207
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:12,460
and you can paint the garage

208
00:10:13,797 --> 00:10:14,797
bring your plunger

209
00:10:14,821 --> 00:10:16,176
the upstairs toilet overflowed

210
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,960
and there's shit all over the floor up there

211
00:10:19,057 --> 00:10:20,057
you drive a tractor?

212
00:10:20,081 --> 00:10:21,161
Good, that'll come in handy

213
00:10:21,185 --> 00:10:23,075
the north 40 needs a lot of attention

214
00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:25,386
bring your chainsaw and your pickaxe

215
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:27,410
we're gonna put your ass to work

216
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:28,796
he wants to help?

217
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:30,820
Fuck him, call his bluff

218
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,516
call his bluff

219
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:34,096
don't hesitate to ask

220
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,120
the nerve of these pricks

221
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:42,176
here's another thing we say to the surviving spouse

222
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,600
I'm keeping him in my thoughts.

223
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:46,900
Where?

224
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:51,210
Where exactly in your thoughts does he fit

225
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:54,676
in between "my ass hurts in this chair" and "let's fuck the waitress"?

226
00:10:54,700 --> 00:11:02,700
What are your priorities?

227
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,106
We use a lot of euphemisms when we talk about death, you know?

228
00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:10,606
People say things like

229
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:12,630
"you know I lost my father"

230
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,050
ahh, he'll turn up

231
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:19,490
you got to stay optimistic with people like that

232
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,466
give them reason to hope.

233
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:23,490
"Have you checked the dumpster out back?"

234
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:26,700
"he used to like to take a nap in there"

235
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,816
keep it upbeat

236
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:29,940
now

237
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:33,256
there's something else that is said

238
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:35,280
after a death

239
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,436
but this one involves

240
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:39,960
belief

241
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:43,000
which is where I begin to have

242
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,220
big problems

243
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:48,896
this one happens after the funeral

244
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,806
or after the burial back at the house

245
00:11:50,830 --> 00:11:52,080
back at the house

246
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:57,080
where the family and friends and the loved ones of the deceased are having some food and drinks

247
00:11:57,340 --> 00:12:01,280
and they're enjoying some warm reminiscences of the person who passed away

248
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:04,160
sooner or later, someone is bound to say the following

249
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:06,740
especially after a few drinks

250
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:09,670
"you know."

251
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:12,490
"I think he's up there now"

252
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:14,930
"smiling down at us"

253
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:18,490
"and I think he's pleased"

254
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:25,820
now

255
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:28,210
first of all

256
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:30,186
there is no...

257
00:12:30,210 --> 00:12:31,760
up there!

258
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:40,336
For people to be smiling

259
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,820
down from

260
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:50,906
it's poetic

261
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:52,180
it's quaint

262
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:56,400
and I guess for superstitious people it provides a little comfort

263
00:12:57,170 --> 00:12:58,530
but it doesn't exist

264
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,046
but if it did, if it did

265
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:05,436
and if someone did survive death in a nonphysical form

266
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:09,820
I personally think he'd be far too busy with other celestial activities

267
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:12,496
then to be standing around paradise

268
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,240
smiling down

269
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:25,646
on live people

270
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:28,400
what kind of a fucking eternity is that?

271
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:32,056
And why is it no one ever says

272
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:34,080
"I think he's down there now"

273
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:37,540
"smiling up at us"

274
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:40,716
apparently it never occurs to people

275
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:42,740
that their loved ones might be in hell

276
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:46,276
your parents could be in hell right now

277
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:48,540
your parents and your father for sure

278
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:52,836
oh shit! Hell is full of dads

279
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:54,656
full of dads

280
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:57,020
even the ones who took you to the ball game

281
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:00,430
just for beating the shit out of you once too often

282
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:02,970
and fucking the neighbor lady

283
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:07,090
and fucking the neighbor dog

284
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:12,440
and who knows, maybe even fucking the UPS man

285
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:16,740
we'll never know what mischief dad was up to

286
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:19,600
parents in heaven

287
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,760
parents in hell, excuse me

288
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,730
kind of gives me a nice feeling, you know

289
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,150
grandparents in hell

290
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:29,150
picture that

291
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,480
picture your grandmother in hell

292
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,816
baking pies

293
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:34,910
without an oven

294
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,456
and if someone were in hell

295
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,456
I doubt very seriously

296
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,000
he'd be smiling.

297
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,616
"I think he's down there now"

298
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,300
"screaming up at us"

299
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:51,580
"and I think he's in severe pain"

300
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:54,990
people just refuse to be realistic

301
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,360
they don't like to be realistic

302
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:00,000
people would rather stroke themselves

303
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:03,146
you know, oh they like to stroke themselves don't they?

304
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:05,836
They stroke themselves, they stroke each other, they get stroked

305
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:07,596
they stroke the boss, the boss strokes them

306
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:08,527
eveybody strokes everybody

307
00:15:08,551 --> 00:15:10,526
it's nothing but a big stroke job in this country

308
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:12,470
the government strokes you everyday of your life

309
00:15:12,494 --> 00:15:14,206
religion never stops stroking you

310
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:15,670
big businesses give you a big stroke

311
00:15:15,694 --> 00:15:17,096
and it's one big transcontinental

312
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,450
cross-country, red, white, and blue stroke job

313
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:21,450
do you know

314
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:28,090
yeah

315
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:32,406
you know what the national emblem of this country ought to be

316
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:34,056
forget the bald eagle

317
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,976
the national emblem of this country

318
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,556
ought to be uncle Sam standing naked at attention saluting

319
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:41,580
and seated on a chair next to him

320
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:44,360
the Statue of Liberty jerking him off

321
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:54,590
that would be a good symbol for the United Strokes of America

322
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:58,116
it's all bullshit folks

323
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:00,570
it's all bullshit and it's bad for ya!

324
00:16:01,727 --> 00:16:02,727
Now

325
00:16:02,751 --> 00:16:04,750
speaking of dead people in heaven

326
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:09,560
there are some people

327
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:11,910
who not only believe

328
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:14,846
that their dead parents in heaven

329
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:16,260
can see them

330
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:17,840
okay

331
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:20,100
okay

332
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,696
they honestly believe

333
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,696
that their dead parents in heaven

334
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,180
can help them

335
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,860
you've heard these people, I'm sure

336
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:35,616
they honestly somehow believe that their dead parents in heaven can intercede with God on their behalf

337
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,180
to gain favors for the living.

338
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:39,206
I come from a Catholic home

339
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:40,770
I heard this shit

340
00:16:42,747 --> 00:16:44,787
they sit there in the chair with the fucking rosary

341
00:16:44,811 --> 00:16:46,687
and they look at you like this you know and they say

342
00:16:46,711 --> 00:16:48,426
"my dad, my dad was looking out for me"

343
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:51,056
"he was looking out I don't know how he got me out of that jam but he got me out"

344
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,027
"oh, my mom"

345
00:16:52,051 --> 00:16:55,816
"my mom was in surgery with me she was in - I could feel her presence in the-"

346
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,636
yea, yea, yea, yea, yea

347
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:59,660
fiiine

348
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:05,840
like the people who die having nothing better to do than to run the heavenly branch of the Make A Wish foundation

349
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:09,750
now

350
00:17:11,156 --> 00:17:12,916
if people want to believe this kind of stuff

351
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:13,656
it's fine with me

352
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:14,377
let them believe it

353
00:17:14,401 --> 00:17:18,120
I don't I don't I don't wanna disabuse anyone of their beliefs but!

354
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,120
I have a question about this

355
00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:22,120
a question that involves

356
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:23,720
logic

357
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,476
let's suppose it's true

358
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,866
let's allow the proposition that somehow

359
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:32,460
dead parents in heaven can help their living children

360
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:33,700
fine so

361
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,246
we got a family living on Earth

362
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:36,606
father and mother and 4 kids

363
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:37,527
it's a family of six

364
00:17:37,551 --> 00:17:38,836
good family, nice family

365
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:41,820
doing all the right things, having a good time, making all the right moves

366
00:17:41,844 --> 00:17:43,536
and the parents go away

367
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:46,306
on a weekend trip and get killed in an accident

368
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:47,956
and the children of course survive

369
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:49,636
so now, according to this theory

370
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:51,426
these two people go to heaven

371
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:53,876
and they start helping their four living children

372
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:55,340
helping them with whatever they need

373
00:17:55,364 --> 00:17:58,206
helping them with their science projects, with their SAT scores

374
00:17:58,230 --> 00:17:59,576
helping them get a good school

375
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,316
and get a nice job and get a promotion and a raise

376
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:03,980
and someone to marry and they all grow up

377
00:18:04,004 --> 00:18:07,096
these 4 kids now grow up and have children of their own

378
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,320
and let's say

379
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:10,746
that all 4 of these now grown children

380
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:12,770
also die at the same time

381
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:15,140
just for the sake of argument

382
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:19,340
let's say there's an explosion at Thanksgiving dinner

383
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:26,356
and these 4 die but their children survive

384
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:27,946
because they were seated

385
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:29,820
at the children's table

386
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:32,760
so.

387
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:36,936
So now according to the theory

388
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,976
these 4 go to heaven and start helping their living children

389
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,696
but what happens to the original two

390
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:44,496
what happens to the grandparents do they just go off-duty now?

391
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:45,337
What do they do?

392
00:18:45,361 --> 00:18:48,001
Are there some activities, is there a retirement program up there?

393
00:18:48,025 --> 00:18:49,705
Are there some activities for these people

394
00:18:49,729 --> 00:18:51,576
shuffleboard, pinball, online poker?

395
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,346
There must be something they can do

396
00:18:53,370 --> 00:18:56,000
or they have to remain on-duty indefinitely

397
00:18:56,050 --> 00:18:59,656
do they have to keep on helping their living descendants forever and ever and ever

398
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,906
is that what heaven is all about, helping the living?

399
00:19:01,930 --> 00:19:05,810
When do you get to just lie back on a cloud and take a fucking harp lesson, you know what I mean?

400
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:08,560
Because

401
00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:10,906
because people have been dying

402
00:19:10,930 --> 00:19:12,796
people have been dying for a long long time

403
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:15,180
there's been a lot of dead motherfuckers, do you know that?

404
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:17,836
Yes, you knew there are a lot of dead motherfuckers

405
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:20,126
we've had a hundred billion people live on this Earth

406
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:21,276
that's what the experts say

407
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:23,096
a hundred billion people have lived here

408
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,080
so let's say half of them died and went to heaven

409
00:19:25,104 --> 00:19:26,486
that's 50 billion people up there

410
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:27,806
that's a pretty crowded place

411
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:29,830
it must get pretty busy and pretty hectic up there

412
00:19:29,854 --> 00:19:31,806
and God must get pretty pissed off

413
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:32,816
with all these favors.

414
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:36,980
"Yeah, yeah, I know, spelling test, Tuesday, get the fuck out of here, would you please?"

415
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:46,446
you know

416
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:49,520
even God can go on sensory overload

417
00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:52,550
that's why he wanted one day off a week.

418
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:55,396
Christians gave him Sunday

419
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:57,396
Jews gave him Saturday.

420
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:59,420
Muslims gave him Friday.

421
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:01,960
God has a 3-day weekend

422
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:07,030
which is probably just what he needs

423
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:10,236
now, just a couple other questions about this whole theory

424
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:12,236
suppose you die

425
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:14,260
without having any children

426
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:16,260
who do you help?

427
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:18,260
Strangers

428
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,260
it would be nice

429
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:24,136
suppose you're an adopted child

430
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:26,160
who helps you?

431
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:28,420
Your biological mother?

432
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,700
She doesn't even know where the fuck you live

433
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:41,620
suppose you kill your parents

434
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,730
would they help you?

435
00:20:49,610 --> 00:20:54,240
I'll guarantee you Mr. and Mrs. Menendez are not helping those two boys

436
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:56,740
no, no

437
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:07,140
yeah, it's all bullshit folks and it's bad for ya!

438
00:21:07,217 --> 00:21:08,217
It's all bullshit

439
00:21:08,241 --> 00:21:10,466
that's what you have to remember as you go through life in this country

440
00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:11,726
it's all bullshit

441
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:13,750
and it's bad for ya

442
00:21:14,316 --> 00:21:15,316
now

443
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:17,420
speaking of parents and speaking of bullshit

444
00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:21,800
two ideas which aren't always mutually exclusive by the way.

445
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:24,666
I'd like to mention a special kind of bullshit

446
00:21:24,690 --> 00:21:26,496
that has taken hold in this country

447
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,716
in the last 30 to 40 years

448
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:30,366
it's a form of bullshit

449
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:32,166
that really only can be called

450
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:33,656
child worship

451
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,516
it's child worship

452
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:37,136
it's the excessive

453
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,336
devotion

454
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,716
to children

455
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:43,010
I'm talking about today's professional parents

456
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:45,336
these these obsessive

457
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,150
diaper sniffers

458
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:51,096
who are over-scheduling and over-managing their children

459
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,450
and robbing them of their childhoods

460
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:55,796
even the simple act of playing

461
00:21:55,820 --> 00:22:03,820
even the simple act of playing

462
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:08,096
has been taken away from children

463
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,816
and put on mommy schedule

464
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,816
in the form of play dates

465
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:14,726
something that should be spontaneous and free

466
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:17,280
is now being rigidly planned

467
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:21,580
when does a kid ever get to sit in the yard with a stick anymore?

468
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:25,840
You know, just sit there with a fucking stick

469
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:30,780
do today's kids even know what a stick is?

470
00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:32,890
You know?

471
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:37,910
You sit in the yard with a fucking stick

472
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:40,470
and you dig a fucking hole

473
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:43,350
you know

474
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:48,380
yeah

475
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,356
and you look at the hole

476
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:53,780
and you look at the stick

477
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:55,760
and you have a little fun

478
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:59,146
but kids don't have sticks anymore

479
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:01,170
I don't think there are any sticks left.

480
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:05,180
I think they've all been recalled because of lead paint

481
00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:12,320
who would've thought that one day the manufacturing of sticks would be outsourced to China?

482
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:14,396
But you know something,

483
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:17,076
the kid shouldn't be wasting his time with a stick anyway

484
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:19,156
if he's 4 years old he should be home

485
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:21,960
studying for his kindergarten entrance exams

486
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,656
you know about that shit? Oh, they have them now, yea, yea

487
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:29,056
there are places that have kindergarten entrance exams

488
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:30,450
the poor little fuck

489
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:34,840
the poor little fuck, he can barely locate his dick

490
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,496
you know, and

491
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:42,886
and already he's being pressured to succeed

492
00:23:42,910 --> 00:23:46,266
pressured to succeed for the sake of the parents

493
00:23:46,290 --> 00:23:50,240
isn't this really just the sophisticated form of child abuse

494
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:53,220
and speaking of that, speaking of child abuse

495
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,526
speaking of child abuse

496
00:24:00,550 --> 00:24:02,550
next stop... grade school

497
00:24:02,770 --> 00:24:07,480
grade school where he won't be allowed to play tag because it encourages victimization

498
00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:11,016
and he won't be allowed to play dodge ball

499
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:13,040
because it's exclusionary

500
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:14,876
and it promotes aggression

501
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:16,876
standing around is still okay

502
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:18,826
standing around is still permitted

503
00:24:18,850 --> 00:24:20,296
but it won't be for long

504
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:23,026
because sooner or later, some kid is gonna be standing around

505
00:24:23,050 --> 00:24:26,076
and his foot will fall asleep and his parents will sue the school

506
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:28,420
and it will be goodbye fucking standing around

507
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
yeah

508
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:40,476
now fortunately, all is not lost

509
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:43,496
all is not lost because at least we know

510
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,266
that when he does get to play

511
00:24:45,290 --> 00:24:47,266
whatever games he is allowed to play

512
00:24:47,290 --> 00:24:49,266
the child will never lose

513
00:24:49,290 --> 00:24:52,086
we know he'll never lose because in today's America

514
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:54,086
no child ever loses

515
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:55,916
there are no losers anymore

516
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:57,136
everyone's a winner

517
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:59,556
no matter what the game or sport or competition

518
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:00,706
everybody wins

519
00:25:00,730 --> 00:25:03,146
everybody wins, everybody gets a trophy

520
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:04,436
no one is a loser

521
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:09,166
no child these days ever gets to hear those all-important, character-building words.

522
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:11,670
"You lost, Bobbie."

523
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:14,520
"You lost, you're a loser, Bobbie"

524
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:17,150
they miss out on that

525
00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:20,466
you know what they tell a kid who lost these days?

526
00:25:20,490 --> 00:25:22,810
"You were the last winner"

527
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:31,420
a lot of these kids never get to hear the truths about themselves until they're in their 20s

528
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:33,526
when their boss calls them in and says.

529
00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:37,196
"Bobbie, clean the shit out of your desk and get the fuck out of here, you're a loser"

530
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:38,380
get the fuck out of here

531
00:25:39,770 --> 00:25:40,770
you know

532
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:51,416
of course, Bobbie's parents can't understand why he can't hold a job

533
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:54,016
in school, he was always on the honor roll

534
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,720
well, what they don't understand of course

535
00:25:55,744 --> 00:25:57,096
is that in today's schools

536
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,096
everyone is on the honor roll

537
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:03,056
everyone is on the honor roll because in order to be on the honor roll

538
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:08,440
all you really need to do is to maintain a body temperature somewhere roughly in the 90s

539
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:14,070
but we shouldn't be worrying about how he's doing in school because you something

540
00:26:14,094 --> 00:26:15,776
come summer time, he'll be off to camp

541
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,626
yes, he'll be off to camp

542
00:26:17,650 --> 00:26:20,996
but not to swim and hike and play softball, no no no no no no no

543
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:23,636
today's child will be sent away to lose weight

544
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:25,660
he'll be sent to fat camp

545
00:26:25,870 --> 00:26:27,156
or violin camp

546
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:28,396
or ceramics camp

547
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:29,466
or computer camp

548
00:26:29,490 --> 00:26:32,260
or leadership camp whatever the fuck that is

549
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:36,100
leadership camp, isn't that where Hitler went?

550
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:41,520
You know, oh

551
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:47,680
specialized, structured summer camps

552
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:49,960
got to keep the little fucker busy, don't they?

553
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:52,270
Got to keep the little fucker busy

554
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:55,976
wouldn't want him to sneak in a little unstructured time in the woods

555
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,460
that wouldn't be any good.

556
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:00,140
God knows he might start jacking off

557
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:07,200
now all of this stupid bullshit that children have been crippled by

558
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:12,040
has grown out of something called the self-esteem movement.

559
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:15,756
The self-esteem movement began in the 1970s

560
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:19,070
and I'm happy to say it has been a complete failure

561
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:20,860
because

562
00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:23,356
studies have repeatedly shown

563
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:26,610
that having high self-esteem does not improve grades

564
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,916
does not improve career achievment

565
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:31,286
it does not even lower the use of alcohol

566
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:35,140
and most certainly does not reduce the incidence of violence of any sort

567
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,656
because as it turns out

568
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:40,620
extremely aggressive violent people think extremely highly of themselves

569
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:47,520
imagine that, sociopaths have high self-esteem

570
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:50,700
who would've thought, huh?

571
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,680
I love when this kind of thing happens

572
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:57,784
I love when these politically correct ideas crash and burn and wind up in the shit-house

573
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:00,240
here's another one that bit the dust

574
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:04,890
this practice of playing Mozart during pregnancy

575
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:06,890
so the fetus can hear it

576
00:28:07,410 --> 00:28:09,676
it was supposed to increase intelligence

577
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:10,587
didn't work

578
00:28:10,611 --> 00:28:11,720
didn't work

579
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:14,076
all it did was sell a lot of CDs

580
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:16,460
and piss off a whole lot of fetuses

581
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:23,960
the self-esteem movement revolved around a single notion

582
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:26,676
the idea, the single idea

583
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:30,020
that every child is special

584
00:28:30,530 --> 00:28:33,436
boy, they said it over and over and over

585
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:35,460
as if to convince themselves

586
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:38,460
every child is special

587
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:39,856
and I kept saying

588
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:42,500
"fuuuuck you!"

589
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:48,596
every child is clearly

590
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:50,620
not special

591
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:52,780
did you ever look at one of them?

592
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:56,220
Did you ever take a good close look at one of these fucking kids?

593
00:28:57,220 --> 00:28:58,220
They're goofy

594
00:28:59,030 --> 00:29:01,150
they're fucking goofy looking

595
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:04,540
they're too small, they're way too fucking small

596
00:29:05,296 --> 00:29:07,656
they're mal-apportioned, their heads don't fit their bodies

597
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:08,726
their arms are too weird

598
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:11,550
remember, they can't walk across the room in a straight line

599
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:14,920
and when they talk, they talk like they've got a mouth full of shit

600
00:29:16,570 --> 00:29:18,160
they're incomplete

601
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:21,050
incomplete, unfinished work.

602
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:22,740
I never give credit

603
00:29:22,990 --> 00:29:24,440
for incomplete work

604
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:27,940
now, P.J.Barnum might think they're special

605
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:31,320
but not me, I have standards

606
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:35,306
but let's say it's true, let's grant this, I'm in a generous mood

607
00:29:35,330 --> 00:29:37,026
let's grant this proposition

608
00:29:37,050 --> 00:29:39,026
let's say it's true that somehow

609
00:29:39,050 --> 00:29:42,010
all, every child is special

610
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:44,010
what about every adult?

611
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:46,440
Isn't every adult special too?

612
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:48,040
And if not

613
00:29:48,470 --> 00:29:51,090
if not, then at what age do you go

614
00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:53,980
from being special

615
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,880
to being not so special?

616
00:29:58,340 --> 00:29:59,906
And if every adult is special

617
00:29:59,930 --> 00:30:01,250
then that means we're all special

618
00:30:01,274 --> 00:30:03,854
and the whole idea loses all its fucking meaning

619
00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:07,800
here's another platitude they jammed down your throat

620
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:10,180
children are our future

621
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:13,640
children are not our future

622
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:17,240
and I can prove it with my usual flawless logic

623
00:30:26,810 --> 00:30:29,236
children can't be our future

624
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:32,486
because by the time the future arrives

625
00:30:32,510 --> 00:30:35,190
they won't be children anymore so blow me!

626
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:40,756
As you may have noticed

627
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:43,660
I always like to present a carefully reasoned argument

628
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:47,780
raising a child is not difficult

629
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:50,456
they try to make it into this mysterious

630
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,916
difficult task

631
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:52,950
nothing to it

632
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:55,176
easiest thing in the world to raise a kid

633
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,200
if you follow the steps

634
00:30:57,580 --> 00:30:58,580
first step

635
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:01,480
you take the kid and you put him out on a street corner

636
00:31:02,390 --> 00:31:04,000
and you leave him there

637
00:31:04,810 --> 00:31:06,560
you come back a week later

638
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:08,786
if the kid is still there

639
00:31:08,810 --> 00:31:11,200
you got yourself a stupid fucking kid

640
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:21,990
then you just proceed from that point

641
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:24,606
it's all bullshit folks

642
00:31:24,630 --> 00:31:27,030
it's all bullshit and it's bad for ya!

643
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:28,780
Now

644
00:31:28,890 --> 00:31:30,200
you wouldn't know it

645
00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:33,600
for some of the things I said over the years

646
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,060
but I like people.

647
00:31:40,390 --> 00:31:41,780
I do.

648
00:31:42,397 --> 00:31:43,397
I like people

649
00:31:43,421 --> 00:31:46,170
but I like them in short bursts.

650
00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:50,380
I don't like people for extended periods of time.

651
00:31:51,090 --> 00:31:53,330
I'm alright with them for a little while

652
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:55,636
but once you get past around

653
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:57,660
minute, minute and a half.

654
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:01,230
I got to get the fuck out of there

655
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:03,556
and my reason for this

656
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:06,600
my reason is for one that you may share possibly.

657
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:10,900
I have a very low tolerance level for stupid bullshit

658
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,830
that's all, stupid bullshit

659
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,466
and everyone wants to tell you their stupid bullshit

660
00:32:24,490 --> 00:32:26,586
and a lot of them don't know when to stop talking

661
00:32:26,610 --> 00:32:27,856
you ever run into that guy?

662
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,336
Doesn't know when to stop talking

663
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:32,820
just continues running at the mouth like verbal diarrhea

664
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:35,346
don't know when the conversation is over

665
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:38,176
stupid, trivial shit you don't care anything about

666
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:40,830
things you're not even remotely interested in.

667
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:43,720
"Did I tell you about my mom and dad?"

668
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:48,470
"Well, my mom and dad went on vacation down in Mammoth Cave, Kentucky."

669
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:49,920
"This is about."

670
00:32:50,490 --> 00:32:51,870
"Six years ago, I think."

671
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:55,566
"Seems like it was six, about six, six years ago"

672
00:32:55,590 --> 00:32:58,040
"six or seven, possibly seven, could be"

673
00:32:58,510 --> 00:32:58,980
yeah.

674
00:32:59,330 --> 00:33:02,920
"Somewhere in there, six, seven, more than six, less than seven"

675
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,240
"let's call it six and a half."

676
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:10,276
"So my mom and dad went on vacation in Mammoth Cave, Kentucky"

677
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:12,276
"and my dad found a big rock"

678
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:13,996
"what he thought was a big rock"

679
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:16,460
"turns out it was a dinosaur turd."

680
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:20,640
"A petrified, dinosaur turd, 27 pounder"

681
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,540
"you know, now that I think of it"

682
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:27,320
"it might have been 8 years ago."

683
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:31,226
"That would have been close to Y2K, wouldn't it?"

684
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:33,106
"Remember Y2K?"

685
00:33:33,130 --> 00:33:34,460
"Whatever happened?"

686
00:33:35,070 --> 00:33:37,916
"Everybody's all worried about that, nothing ever happened."

687
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:40,086
"HAHAHAHA, big fuss."

688
00:33:40,110 --> 00:33:41,356
"Nothing ever happened"

689
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:44,780
"you know, God, that's strange, you know?"

690
00:33:45,570 --> 00:33:49,800
"so let's say, we'll say it's 8 years, 8 years, 8? It was either 8 or 5."

691
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:54,736
"So my dad gives my mom this big turd"

692
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:58,760
"and he says: Here mom, it's a big dinosaur turd, put it in your purse to take that home"

693
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:04,260
"my mom said: Dad, I don't think it's a dinosaur turd this thing's still warm."

694
00:34:05,930 --> 00:34:09,050
"Whoever dropped this thing is still walking around in here"

695
00:34:09,270 --> 00:34:11,610
"and we better get the fuck out of this cave."

696
00:34:16,470 --> 00:34:20,040
"Nine years ago, nine."

697
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:22,176
"I know it was nine"

698
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:27,350
"because my wife was pregnant with our first boy, Makhmoudi ben Al Said ben Salam"

699
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:30,040
"and he's ten now"

700
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:37,316
"or is he, he's 11, maybe he's 11"

701
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:39,340
"he's either 11 or 5"

702
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,836
and while all of this is going on

703
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:46,576
you're searching in your mind for something diplomatic and tactful and graceful that you can say

704
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:48,356
to help end the conversation

705
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:51,116
and all I can ever come up with is "blow it out your ass!"

706
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:53,116
"Blow it out your ass!"

707
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:54,696
"Blow it out your ass!"

708
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:56,436
"Blow it out your ass!"

709
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:58,460
"Blow it out your ass!"

710
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,040
you know

711
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,436
but you can't say that

712
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:08,636
you-good manners don't permit it

713
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:10,236
you have to find another way

714
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:11,496
and I go to

715
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:12,696
body language

716
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:16,356
I tried to use my body language to show that the conversation is over

717
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:19,820
I find myself leaning at a 45 degree angle

718
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:23,480
trying to indicate the direction I'd like to go

719
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:26,540
if this person would just shut the fuck up

720
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:30,780
and I might even give him a verbal cue "Surgery!"

721
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:33,420
"Surgery, I'm late for surgery!"

722
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:37,080
I'm having my ears sown shut

723
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:40,760
you know

724
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:42,760
yeah

725
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:45,556
same people on the phone

726
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:46,876
same people on the phone

727
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:49,696
don't know when to hang up, don't know when the conversation's over

728
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:51,196
dumb, trivial shit

729
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:52,796
dumb questions.

730
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:56,420
"So what are you guys gonna do five summers from now?"

731
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:58,616
"We haven't made any plans."

732
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:02,976
"Marge wants to go to the beach, the kids kind of like it at the lake, and I want to go to the mountains."

733
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,640
"Grandma wants to visit her sister in Frogballs, Arkansas."

734
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:09,576
"How about you, you made any plans?"

735
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,576
"It's never too early to make plans."

736
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:14,620
"We're going to Norway in 2025."

737
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:20,776
"Did you know that up to the 1950s, Norway's economy was based largely on fishing?"

738
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:25,456
"but now, thanks to the expansion of the world's economy and the increased improved drilling technique"

739
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:30,376
and once again, you're searching in your mind for the right thing to say to help end the conversation.

740
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,740
"Shut the fuck up" comes to mind

741
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:37,616
uh, or blow it out your-how about "shut your fucking pie hole" might be good

742
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:41,316
or if he prefers cake "shut your fucking cake hole"

743
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:43,036
but these things you don't wanna

744
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:47,096
you can't say those things and you can't use body language on the phone

745
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:50,160
well, you can always amuse yourself, you know

746
00:36:57,140 --> 00:36:58,296
or if it's your mother

747
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:01,400
you show your mother respect, you put her on speaker phone

748
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:13,276
but that doesn't move the conversation along

749
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:14,876
you have to find another trick

750
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:17,396
and I go to tone of voice

751
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:20,776
did you ever use your tone of voice to try to talk them into a soft landing?

752
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:23,096
You try to coax the person towards the end.

753
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:25,996
"Right, good, okay, good"

754
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:29,856
"alright then, good, great, okay, good, okay, thank you"

755
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:30,520
"yeah, alright"

756
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:33,700
oh fuck there he goes again.

757
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:39,616
"Remember my neighbor with the burns on 90% of her body?"

758
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:43,136
"Well, she burned the other 10% now"

759
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:46,180
"she was lighting a fart and her bush caught fire"

760
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:57,880
"listen, listen, Reverend?"

761
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:04,616
"Rev, Reverend, Reverend, I hate to be rude but"

762
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,980
"I just took a three and a half hour shit"

763
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:10,960
"and I'm bleeding from the asshole"

764
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:15,260
"well, I don't have any Mercurochrome."

765
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:19,100
"Yes, yeah, I'll put a Snoopie band-aid on it."

766
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:23,860
"Yeah, thank you, you do that for me, yeah, say a prayer for my asshole, thank you very much"

767
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:28,516
you have to resort to these tactics because many people do not understand

768
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:30,516
what a phone call should be

769
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:32,036
or what a phone call is

770
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:34,836
ideally, a phone call is

771
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:38,376
the brief exchange of a few vital pieces of information

772
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,316
this is a phone call.

773
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:43,120
"Hey Steve, what time does the circle jerk start tonight?"

774
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:48,600
"Ten o'clock, okay, listen, I'm gonna be a little bit late, you're gonna have to start without me."

775
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:53,816
"Oh, don't worry, I'll catch up, I'm meeting a whole bunch boys and watching a horny movie."

776
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:57,400
"Uh, it's called Tarzan Fucks a Zebra."

777
00:38:58,100 --> 00:38:59,800
"Russell Crowe."

778
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:07,420
"Well, it's kind of a fantasy, right now Renee Zelweiger is blowing off a unicorn"

779
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:10,140
that's a phone call

780
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:17,160
it should not be a two and a half hour harangue of your third cousin describing her mailman's liposuction.

781
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:20,200
God, people are fucking boring

782
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:23,656
people are just fucking boring

783
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:26,316
you know what would be great for a guy like me?

784
00:39:26,340 --> 00:39:28,340
Just to be in a coma

785
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:31,836
wouldn't that be great?

786
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:32,896
Nothing to do all day

787
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:35,640
you just crap out and breathe through a fucking tube

788
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:38,836
they feed you through a tube there's nothing to do

789
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:41,840
boy, you talking about being a couch potato that's it man!

790
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:44,276
No phone calls coming in

791
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:46,896
nobody dropping by unexpectedly

792
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:50,020
and if they do drop by, you're completely unaware of it!

793
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:52,496
'cause you're in a fucking coma

794
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:54,856
and you're practically clinically dead

795
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:57,616
and you don't have to listen to their stupid shit

796
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:59,616
their stupid shit like about

797
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:01,836
their new ride around lawn mower

798
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:06,240
with a two toned horn and a GPS in case they get lost on the lawn

799
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:14,616
and their boss and their job and their car and their kids

800
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:17,400
Jesus fucking Christ

801
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:19,776
their kids

802
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:22,376
folks, folks, nothing worse

803
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:24,376
nothing worse

804
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:28,496
than to be stuck somewhere with some married asshole

805
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:31,540
and have to listen to him tell you about his fucking kids

806
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:34,320
let me tell you something folks

807
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:39,016
nobody cares about your children, okay?

808
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:41,040
You're welcome, you're welcome

809
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:49,560
nobody cares about your children, I speak for everyone

810
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:55,216
I've been appointed by the rest of the group to inform you we don't care about your children

811
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:58,680
that's why they're your children

812
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:01,940
so you can care about them and we don't have to bother

813
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:03,816
but they tell you anyway

814
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:06,996
Todd is in the seventh grade now

815
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:09,020
he's in the cheese club.

816
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:13,116
Giselle is five

817
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:16,060
and already she's had nine periods.

818
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:20,976
Yohan is eleven

819
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:25,420
and he pretty much sits around the house hallucinating all the time

820
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:29,196
then they want to show you the pictures

821
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:31,196
here's another ordeal

822
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:32,316
the pictures

823
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:34,340
of these little gargoyles

824
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,476
that they have loosed

825
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:39,500
from their loins.

826
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:44,116
A lot of these professional mommies

827
00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:47,196
boy, they think there's nothing better than having a baby

828
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:49,220
oh, they think it's the biggest thing in the world

829
00:41:49,244 --> 00:41:52,036
like it's a big event, having a baby

830
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:54,480
I call it pumping out a unit

831
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:58,136
that's that's all they're doing

832
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:01,420
that's all their doing, pumping out a fucking unit

833
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:08,240
some of them like assembly lines, like a factory

834
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:11,736
every fucking year

835
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:13,760
hey Jeff, want a kid?

836
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:17,800
How about twins?

837
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:20,420
Polluting the Earth

838
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:24,620
polluting the Earth with these creatures

839
00:42:25,860 --> 00:42:27,640
who have no future

840
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:30,096
they have no future

841
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:34,456
have you pictured what this planet is gonna be like in 40 to 50 years?

842
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:37,720
It's gonna be a big smoking ball of shit

843
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:44,780
a big, smoking, flaming, stinking ball of gaseous shit

844
00:42:45,380 --> 00:42:47,376
that's what's gonna happen

845
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:49,400
that's what's gonna happen

846
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:52,436
it's irresponsible to have more than one child

847
00:42:52,460 --> 00:42:53,337
have one

848
00:42:53,361 --> 00:42:56,616
have one child, replacement value for yourself that's all

849
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:59,020
don't even replace your husband

850
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:01,680
don't replace your husband

851
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:07,760
he's done enough fucking damage as it is

852
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:11,576
but they want to show you the pictures

853
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:14,396
sometimes they warn you, you know, that's good, they say

854
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:16,880
"hey, want to see some pictures of my kids?", "No!"

855
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:20,400
just describe them to me

856
00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:22,796
but they show you and, uh,

857
00:43:22,820 --> 00:43:24,356
there are two ways you can handle them

858
00:43:24,380 --> 00:43:27,236
I have found two ways to handle the pictures

859
00:43:27,260 --> 00:43:29,236
the first is the easy way

860
00:43:29,260 --> 00:43:31,176
you just kind of take it all in stride

861
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:33,376
matter-of-factly, go along with the game.

862
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:35,400
"Uh-huh, boy, hmm."

863
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:37,616
"Girl, yeah."

864
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:39,616
"Older boy."

865
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:42,056
"Older girl, good, four."

866
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:45,400
"Listen, I have to go wash my crotch, I'll see you later"

867
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:48,880
and you get the fuck out of there

868
00:43:49,620 --> 00:43:51,776
or you can do what I do

869
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:53,800
you can do what I do

870
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:57,700
be a little honest about what you see

871
00:43:59,260 --> 00:44:00,640
take your chance

872
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:03,300
tell the truth

873
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:12,900
look at the fucking head on that kid.

874
00:44:15,460 --> 00:44:18,776
Jesus, where did he get a fucking head like that, holy shit

875
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:20,800
that thing is huge!

876
00:44:21,140 --> 00:44:23,160
Have you put him on YouTube yet?

877
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:27,380
Boy, you'll get a lot of hits with a head like that

878
00:44:27,820 --> 00:44:30,400
or put him on eBay, you might make a little money, you know.

879
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:35,536
I'm sure some European circus would snap his ass up in a fucking minute, boy.

880
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:38,900
Goddamn, that thing is unusual

881
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:42,400
listen, maybe he'll grow into it, you never know with kids

882
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:44,696
hey, let me ask you a practical question

883
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:47,560
where do you find hats for a kid like that?

884
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:51,800
Tell the truth, don't be bullshitting people

885
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:55,220
don't be bullshitting, there's enough bullshitting as it is, folks

886
00:44:55,660 --> 00:44:56,996
there's plenty of bullshit

887
00:44:57,020 --> 00:44:59,660
then they want to show you the pictures of the little girl

888
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:02,760
whose second teeth are coming in

889
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:05,136
and they think it's cute

890
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:06,600
it's not

891
00:45:07,660 --> 00:45:10,300
it's fucking horrifying

892
00:45:12,020 --> 00:45:14,936
did you ever take-did you ever look at the teeth on some of these kids

893
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:17,400
did you ever take a good, close look in the mouth

894
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:19,600
did you ever look in there, see what's going on

895
00:45:19,624 --> 00:45:22,144
sometimes several rows of fucking teeth coming in

896
00:45:22,580 --> 00:45:25,036
coming in at all funny angles

897
00:45:25,060 --> 00:45:27,260
there's one under the tooth, that's one under the tooth

898
00:45:27,284 --> 00:45:29,036
tongue, that's an unusual place for a tooth

899
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:31,720
a sublingual tooth, my God! Look at that

900
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:34,980
once again, tell the truth

901
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:38,300
you better start saving your money right now, pal

902
00:45:38,980 --> 00:45:41,860
this is gonna cost you a fucking fortune to fix that

903
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:47,480
you're gonna need an international team of orthodontists around the clock

904
00:45:47,820 --> 00:45:52,560
just to make it better you might want to call FEMA that looks like a real fucking problem

905
00:45:53,420 --> 00:45:56,776
you have the number of the National Guard, give them a ring

906
00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:00,820
listen, why don't you just have them all pulled and let her start over again, you know?

907
00:46:01,780 --> 00:46:04,040
Or take a picture of her with her mouth closed

908
00:46:04,420 --> 00:46:06,736
that would save you a lot of heartache in the long run

909
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:09,256
listen, you're not Catholic by any chance, are you?

910
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:13,540
Well, the reason I ask you is that you might want to take her to Lourdes and pray for a miracle over there

911
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:17,420
tell the truth, don't be bullshitting people

912
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:21,220
like I said, there's enough bullshit as it is

913
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:23,616
there's enough bullshit as it is

914
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:26,440
in fact, there's just enough, did you know that?

915
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:28,756
There's just enough bullshit

916
00:46:28,780 --> 00:46:31,560
to hold things together in this country

917
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:33,940
bullshit is the glue

918
00:46:34,340 --> 00:46:36,796
that binds us as a nation

919
00:46:36,820 --> 00:46:38,936
where would we be

920
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:40,316
without our safe

921
00:46:40,340 --> 00:46:41,317
familiar

922
00:46:41,341 --> 00:46:43,340
American bullshit

923
00:46:43,740 --> 00:46:46,756
land of the free, home of the brave, the American dream

924
00:46:46,780 --> 00:46:50,276
all men are equal, justice is blind, the press is free

925
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:52,300
your vote counts

926
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:57,036
business is honest, the good guy wins

927
00:46:57,060 --> 00:46:59,820
the police are on your side.

928
00:47:00,220 --> 00:47:02,256
God is watching you

929
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:05,680
your standard of living will never decline

930
00:47:06,380 --> 00:47:09,356
and everything is gonna be just fine

931
00:47:09,380 --> 00:47:12,116
the official, national bullshit story

932
00:47:12,140 --> 00:47:14,636
I call it the American okey-doke.

933
00:47:14,660 --> 00:47:19,356
Every one of those items is provably untrue at one level or another

934
00:47:19,380 --> 00:47:22,976
but we believe them because they're pounded into our heads from the time we're children

935
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,436
that's what they do with that kind of stuff

936
00:47:24,460 --> 00:47:26,776
they put it in the heads of kids, they pound it in there

937
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:28,676
because kids, they know kids are too young

938
00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:32,216
to be able to mount a sophisticated argument against these kinds of ideas

939
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:35,096
and so, kids, and up to a certain age, by the way

940
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:37,856
kids are gonna believe everything a grownup tells them, everything

941
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:40,236
so kids never learn to question things

942
00:47:40,260 --> 00:47:42,256
nobody questions things in this country anymore

943
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:44,016
nobody questions things

944
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:46,016
why? People are too fat and happy

945
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:48,396
people are way too fucking prosperous for their own good

946
00:47:48,420 --> 00:47:52,200
everyone's got a cellphone that'll make pancakes and rub their balls now, you know

947
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:54,296
so,

948
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:55,257
nobody wants

949
00:47:55,281 --> 00:47:57,256
nobody wants to rock the boat

950
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:59,316
and people, people just

951
00:47:59,340 --> 00:48:01,776
gizmos, Americans have been silenced

952
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:04,476
bought off and silenced by gizmos and toys

953
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:06,781
and as a result, no one's ever learned to question things

954
00:48:06,805 --> 00:48:10,525
no one questions things in this country anymore, no one questions things

955
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:16,776
you remember Barbara Bush

956
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:19,740
I call her the silver douche bag, remember her?

957
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:25,836
Barbara Bush, she is the mother of governor George Bush

958
00:48:25,860 --> 00:48:31,820
I call him governor Bush because that's the only elected office he held legally in our country, okay?

959
00:48:39,780 --> 00:48:42,096
I don't care where they hang his portrait

960
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:44,096
I don't care how big his library is

961
00:48:44,120 --> 00:48:46,096
he'll always be Governor Bush

962
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:51,016
I don't even capitalize his name when I type it anymore

963
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:53,416
so she's the mother of governor George Bush

964
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:56,576
she's also the wife of his father George H. W Bush

965
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:59,736
who did become president in the normal, legal, traditional manner

966
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:03,536
and when he did she came along for the ride as first lady

967
00:49:03,560 --> 00:49:05,536
and that's been the tradition up till now

968
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:09,816
a man has been elected and the woman comes along for the ride as first lady

969
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:12,576
and usually as in American life in general

970
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:14,656
the woman is condescended to

971
00:49:14,680 --> 00:49:18,136
patronized, given something to do to keep her busy

972
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:21,296
a lot of times you give her a charity or a cause, something she can champion

973
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:25,036
Betty Ford was told to drink, remember that?

974
00:49:25,060 --> 00:49:28,596
Yeah, yeah, that was, that was Betty Ford's assignment

975
00:49:28,620 --> 00:49:33,016
Betty, you get drunk, you get totally fall-down, fucked up, shit-faced drunk, okay?

976
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:35,396
You just get fucked up drunk

977
00:49:35,420 --> 00:49:38,236
I will hose you down baby, we'll hose you down

978
00:49:38,260 --> 00:49:40,376
we'll put you in the facility, you get sober

979
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:42,160
and then we'll put your name on the facility

980
00:49:42,184 --> 00:49:45,144
Lisa Minelli can get sober and everything's gonna be okay, right?

981
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:47,020
That was her assignment

982
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:49,680
Barbra Bush's assignment was

983
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:52,016
getting children to read

984
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:54,716
remember that? Getting children to read

985
00:49:54,740 --> 00:49:58,800
they figured that she had so much success with George

986
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:14,536
that she would be a natural to get children to read

987
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:16,396
which misses the point completely

988
00:50:16,420 --> 00:50:18,196
not important to get children to read

989
00:50:18,220 --> 00:50:19,797
children who want to read are gonna read

990
00:50:19,821 --> 00:50:22,021
kids that want to learn to read are gonna learn to read

991
00:50:22,045 --> 00:50:24,616
much more important to teach children to question what they read

992
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:27,056
children should be taught to question everything

993
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:30,656
question everything they read, everything they hear

994
00:50:30,680 --> 00:50:33,356
children should be taught to question authority

995
00:50:33,380 --> 00:50:36,856
parents never teach their children to question authority because

996
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:41,476
parents are authority figures themselves and they don't want to undermine their own bullshit inside the household

997
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:43,796
so they stroke the kid and the kid strokes them

998
00:50:43,820 --> 00:50:44,737
and they all stroke each other

999
00:50:44,761 --> 00:50:47,540
and they all grow up all fucked up and they come to shows like this

1000
00:50:56,580 --> 00:51:00,636
kids have to be warned that there's bullshit coming down the road

1001
00:51:00,660 --> 00:51:02,460
that's the biggest thing you can do for a kid

1002
00:51:02,484 --> 00:51:04,416
tell him what life in this country is about

1003
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:05,800
it's about a whole lot of bullshit

1004
00:51:05,824 --> 00:51:08,004
that needs to be detected and avoided

1005
00:51:08,236 --> 00:51:09,516
that's the best thing you can do

1006
00:51:09,540 --> 00:51:10,397
no one ever told me

1007
00:51:10,421 --> 00:51:12,056
no one told me a thing like that

1008
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:15,116
I was never warned about any of this, had to find all that out for myself

1009
00:51:15,140 --> 00:51:17,236
and there are still, as with you probably

1010
00:51:17,260 --> 00:51:21,436
a lot of things that you're expected to believe and accept in America

1011
00:51:21,460 --> 00:51:24,476
that I personally have a problem with

1012
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:25,636
and I question a lot of these things

1013
00:51:25,660 --> 00:51:26,637
to give you an example

1014
00:51:26,661 --> 00:51:28,616
I saw a slogan on a guy's car that said.

1015
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:30,236
Proud to be an American

1016
00:51:30,260 --> 00:51:32,300
and I thought, "well what the fuck does that mean?"

1017
00:51:32,860 --> 00:51:34,776
Proud to be an American, you see

1018
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:36,576
I've never understood national pride

1019
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:38,576
I've never understood ethnic pride

1020
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:43,736
because I'm Irish and all four of my grandparents were born in Ireland so I'm fully Irish

1021
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:46,436
and when I was a kid, I would go to the Saint Patrick's day parade

1022
00:51:46,460 --> 00:51:48,436
and I noticed that they sold a button that said.

1023
00:51:48,460 --> 00:51:49,936
Proud to be Irish

1024
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:52,276
and I could never understand that because I knew

1025
00:51:52,300 --> 00:51:54,776
that on Columbus day, they sold a different button

1026
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:56,536
that said Proud to be Italian

1027
00:51:56,560 --> 00:51:58,736
then came Black pride and Puerto Rican pride

1028
00:51:58,760 --> 00:52:01,756
and I could never understand ethnic or national pride

1029
00:52:01,780 --> 00:52:02,856
because to me

1030
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:05,536
pride should be reserved for something you achieved

1031
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:07,796
or attained on your own

1032
00:52:07,820 --> 00:52:10,416
not something that happens by accident of birth

1033
00:52:10,440 --> 00:52:12,440
being Irish

1034
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:20,600
being Irish isn't a skill

1035
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:24,100
it's a fucking genetic accident

1036
00:52:24,780 --> 00:52:27,536
you wouldn't say I'm proud to be 5/11

1037
00:52:27,560 --> 00:52:31,180
I'm proud to have a predisposition for colon cancer

1038
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:34,456
then why the fuck would you be proud to be Irish.

1039
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:36,360
Proud to be Italian, or American, or anything

1040
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:38,280
hey, if you're happy with it, then that's fine

1041
00:52:38,304 --> 00:52:39,536
do that, put that on your car

1042
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:40,996
happy to be an American

1043
00:52:41,020 --> 00:52:42,496
be happy, don't be proud

1044
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:43,776
too much pride as it is

1045
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:45,776
pride goeth before a fall

1046
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:47,776
never forget proverbs, okay?

1047
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:49,800
Now, here's another slogan

1048
00:52:50,260 --> 00:52:52,600
here's another slogan you're running to all the time.

1049
00:52:52,660 --> 00:52:54,096
God bless America

1050
00:52:54,120 --> 00:52:57,860
once again, respectfully, I say to myself, "what the fuck does that mean?"

1051
00:52:58,740 --> 00:53:01,696
God bless America? Is that a request?

1052
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:04,876
Is that a demand? Is that a suggestion?

1053
00:53:04,900 --> 00:53:07,356
Politicians say it at the end of every speech

1054
00:53:07,380 --> 00:53:09,216
as if it were some sort of verbal tick

1055
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:11,240
that they can't get rid of.

1056
00:53:11,580 --> 00:53:15,056
God bless you and God bless America, God bless you and God bless America

1057
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:16,720
I guess they figured if they leave it out

1058
00:53:16,744 --> 00:53:19,236
someone's gonna think they're bad Americans

1059
00:53:19,260 --> 00:53:21,496
let me tell you a little secret about God, folks.

1060
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:26,036
God does not give a flying fuck about America, okay? He doesn't care

1061
00:53:26,060 --> 00:53:27,736
he never cared about this country

1062
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:29,596
he never has, he never will

1063
00:53:29,620 --> 00:53:31,256
he doesn't care about this country

1064
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:33,936
anymore than he cares about Mongolia.

1065
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:37,596
Transylvania, Pittsburgh, the Suez Canal, or the North Pole

1066
00:53:37,620 --> 00:53:41,256
he simply doesn't care, okay? He doesn't care.

1067
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:43,456
Listen, hey

1068
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:45,596
there are 200 countries in the world now

1069
00:53:45,620 --> 00:53:49,200
do these people honestly think that God is sitting around picking out his favorites?

1070
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:50,916
Why would he do that?

1071
00:53:50,940 --> 00:53:53,136
Why would God have a favorite country?

1072
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:56,056
And why would it be America, out of all the countries?

1073
00:53:56,080 --> 00:53:58,056
Because we have the most money?

1074
00:53:58,080 --> 00:54:00,056
Because he likes our national anthem?

1075
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:02,156
Maybe it's because he heard we have

1076
00:54:02,180 --> 00:54:06,000
eighteen delicious flavors of classic rice-a-ronni

1077
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:10,656
it's delusional thinking, it's delusional thinking

1078
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:13,536
and Americans are not alone with these sort of delusions

1079
00:54:13,560 --> 00:54:17,056
military cemetaries around the world are packed

1080
00:54:17,080 --> 00:54:22,896
with brainwashed, dead soldiers who were convinced God was on their side.

1081
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:24,936
America prays for God to destroy our enemies

1082
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:26,736
our enemies pray for God to destroy us

1083
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:28,500
somebody's gonna be disappointed

1084
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:32,196
somebody's wasting their fucking time

1085
00:54:32,220 --> 00:54:34,220
could it be... everyone?

1086
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:38,780
Now, now

1087
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:49,760
if people want to say God loves America, that's their business, I don't care, but here's what I don't understand

1088
00:54:49,784 --> 00:54:51,436
if they say God bless America presumably

1089
00:54:51,460 --> 00:54:52,636
they believe in God

1090
00:54:52,660 --> 00:54:55,616
and if they do, they must have heard God loves everyone

1091
00:54:55,640 --> 00:54:58,176
that's what he said, he loves everyone and loves them equally

1092
00:54:58,200 --> 00:55:02,276
so why would these people ask God to do something that went against his own teachings?

1093
00:55:02,300 --> 00:55:04,396
You know what God bless America people ought to do

1094
00:55:04,420 --> 00:55:07,636
they ought to check with that Jesus fellow they're so crazy about

1095
00:55:07,660 --> 00:55:10,736
they're always talking about what would Jesus do, what would Jesus do

1096
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:12,320
they don't wanna know so they can do it

1097
00:55:12,344 --> 00:55:14,784
they just want to know so they can tell other people to do it

1098
00:55:14,808 --> 00:55:18,344
well, I'll tell you what Jesus would have done.

1099
00:55:21,140 --> 00:55:22,896
I'll tell you what Jesus would have done

1100
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:28,476
he would have got up to the top of the Empire States Building and said God bless everyone around the world for ever and ever until the end of time

1101
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:29,820
that's what Jesus would have done

1102
00:55:29,844 --> 00:55:31,417
and that's what these people should do

1103
00:55:31,441 --> 00:55:34,836
or else they should admit that God Bless America is really just

1104
00:55:34,860 --> 00:55:36,976
some sort of an empty slogan

1105
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,496
with no real meaning

1106
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:41,140
except for something vague like good luck

1107
00:55:42,220 --> 00:55:44,480
good luck America, you're on your own

1108
00:55:45,100 --> 00:55:47,456
which is a little bit closer to the truth

1109
00:55:47,480 --> 00:55:50,936
here's a civic custom that I don't understand

1110
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:52,016
maybe you can help me

1111
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:54,756
taking off your hat when a flag passes by

1112
00:55:54,780 --> 00:55:58,316
or when some jackoff at the ballpark starts singing the national anthem

1113
00:55:58,340 --> 00:56:00,196
they tell you to take off your hat

1114
00:56:00,220 --> 00:56:03,040
what the fuck does a hat have to do with being patriotic

1115
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:07,776
what possible relationship exists between the uncovered head

1116
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:09,800
and a feeling that ought to live in your heart

1117
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:12,220
suppose you have a red, white, and blue hat

1118
00:56:12,420 --> 00:56:14,636
suppose you have a hat made out of a flag

1119
00:56:14,660 --> 00:56:16,776
why would you take it off to honor the flag

1120
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:18,776
wouldn't you leave it on?

1121
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:20,800
And point it towards the flag

1122
00:56:26,860 --> 00:56:29,656
and what's so bad about hats that you have to take them off

1123
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:31,680
why not take off your pants

1124
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:34,096
or your shoes

1125
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:35,440
they tell you that at the airport

1126
00:56:35,464 --> 00:56:37,236
they say, "take off your shoes"

1127
00:56:37,260 --> 00:56:41,900
they tell you it's for national security so taking off your shoes could be patriotic too

1128
00:56:42,120 --> 00:56:45,756
I started to question all this stupid hat shit when I was a kid

1129
00:56:45,780 --> 00:56:47,756
when I was a kid, I was a Catholic

1130
00:56:47,780 --> 00:56:50,996
at least until I reached the age of reason, okay?

1131
00:56:51,020 --> 00:56:53,516
So, I was a Catholic

1132
00:56:53,540 --> 00:56:55,476
I was a Catholic for about

1133
00:56:55,500 --> 00:56:57,500
two, two and a half years, something like that

1134
00:56:58,840 --> 00:57:02,296
and during that time, one of the things they told us was

1135
00:57:02,320 --> 00:57:04,716
that if a boy or a man went into a church

1136
00:57:04,740 --> 00:57:06,196
he had to remove his hat

1137
00:57:06,220 --> 00:57:08,376
in order to honor the presence of God

1138
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:10,536
but, they'd already told me that.

1139
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:11,976
God was everywhere

1140
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,436
so I just wonder

1141
00:57:13,460 --> 00:57:15,036
well if God was everywhere

1142
00:57:15,060 --> 00:57:16,680
why would you even own a hat?

1143
00:57:17,740 --> 00:57:21,340
Why not show your respect? Don't even buy a fucking hat

1144
00:57:22,320 --> 00:57:24,536
and just to confuse things further

1145
00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:27,200
they told the women exactly the opposite.

1146
00:57:27,700 --> 00:57:30,516
Catholic women and girls had to cover their heads

1147
00:57:30,540 --> 00:57:31,796
when they went into church

1148
00:57:31,820 --> 00:57:33,516
same as in certain temples

1149
00:57:33,540 --> 00:57:36,276
Jewish men have to cover their heads in those temples

1150
00:57:36,300 --> 00:57:39,276
in those same temples Jewish women are not allowed to cover their heads

1151
00:57:39,300 --> 00:57:41,300
so try to figure this shit out.

1152
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:44,960
Catholic men and Jewish women, no hats.

1153
00:57:45,740 --> 00:57:49,456
Catholic, catholic women and Jewish men, hats

1154
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:53,400
somebody's got the whole thing totally fucking backwards, don't you think?

1155
00:57:55,380 --> 00:57:59,956
And what is this religious fascination with headgear?

1156
00:57:59,980 --> 00:58:02,616
Every religion has got a different fucking hat

1157
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:03,796
did you ever notice that?

1158
00:58:03,820 --> 00:58:04,976
The Hindus have a turban

1159
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:06,756
the Sikhs have a tall, white turban

1160
00:58:06,780 --> 00:58:08,296
Jews have a Yamaka.

1161
00:58:08,320 --> 00:58:10,296
Muslims have the kafiya

1162
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:13,196
bishop has a pointy hat on one day and a round hat on another day

1163
00:58:13,220 --> 00:58:15,116
cardinal has a red hat, pope has a white

1164
00:58:15,140 --> 00:58:17,116
everybody's got a fucking hat

1165
00:58:17,140 --> 00:58:19,300
one group takes them off, the other group puts them on

1166
00:58:19,460 --> 00:58:21,976
personally, I would never want to be a member of any group

1167
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,976
where you either have to wear a hat or you can't wear a hat

1168
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
I think.

1169
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:40,516
I think all religions should have one rule and one rule only

1170
00:58:40,540 --> 00:58:42,540
hats optional

1171
00:58:43,380 --> 00:58:46,416
that's all you need to run a really good religion

1172
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:49,176
here's another one of these civic customs

1173
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:51,176
swearing on the Bible

1174
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:53,176
you understand that shit?

1175
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:56,296
They tell you to raise your right hand, place your left hand on the Bible

1176
00:58:56,320 --> 00:58:58,696
does this stuff really matter, which hand?

1177
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:02,056
Does God really give a fuck about details like this

1178
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:05,000
suppose you put your right hand on the Bible and you raise your left hand

1179
00:59:05,024 --> 00:59:06,344
would that count?

1180
00:59:06,940 --> 00:59:10,736
Or would God say, "Sorry, wrong hand, try again"

1181
00:59:10,760 --> 00:59:12,736
and why

1182
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:15,640
why does one hand have to be raised?

1183
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:18,876
What is the magic in this gesture?

1184
00:59:18,900 --> 00:59:23,500
This seems like some sort of a primitive, voodoo mojo shtick

1185
00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:27,696
why not put your left hand on the Bible and let your right hand hang down by your side?

1186
00:59:27,720 --> 00:59:30,216
It's more natural or put it in your pocket

1187
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:33,320
remember what your mother used to say, " don't put your hands in your pocket"

1188
00:59:33,344 --> 00:59:35,576
does she know something we don't know?

1189
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:38,376
Is this hand shit really important?

1190
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:43,080
Now, let's get back to the Bible, America's favorite national theatrical prop

1191
00:59:44,420 --> 00:59:48,636
suppose the Bible they hand you to swear on is upside down

1192
00:59:48,660 --> 00:59:50,116
or backward

1193
00:59:50,140 --> 00:59:51,236
or both

1194
00:59:51,260 --> 00:59:54,420
do you swear to tell the truth on an upside down, backward bible?

1195
00:59:55,320 --> 00:59:56,976
Would that count?

1196
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:58,756
Suppose

1197
00:59:58,780 --> 01:00:02,676
the Bible they hand you is an old Bible and half the pages are missing

1198
01:00:02,700 --> 01:00:05,656
suppose all they have is a Chinese Bible

1199
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:07,656
in an American court

1200
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:10,816
or Braille Bible and you're not blind

1201
01:00:10,840 --> 01:00:12,316
suppose

1202
01:00:12,340 --> 01:00:17,200
they hand you an upside down, backward, Chinese, Braille Bible with half the pages missing

1203
01:00:24,260 --> 01:00:31,076
at what point does all this stuff just break down and become just a lot of stupid shit that somebody made up

1204
01:00:31,100 --> 01:00:34,176
they fucking made it up folks, it's make-believe

1205
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:35,436
it's make-believe

1206
01:00:35,460 --> 01:00:39,740
now, alright, okay

1207
01:00:43,260 --> 01:00:47,596
let's leave the Bible aside, we'll get back to the science fiction reading later

1208
01:00:47,620 --> 01:00:50,860
the more important question is

1209
01:00:51,560 --> 01:00:55,516
what is the big deal about swearing to God in the first place

1210
01:00:55,540 --> 01:00:57,196
why does swearing to God

1211
01:00:57,220 --> 01:00:59,196
mean you're gonna tell the truth?

1212
01:00:59,220 --> 01:01:00,480
Wouldn't affect me

1213
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:05,841
if they said to me, "Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?"

1214
01:01:05,865 --> 01:01:07,345
I'd say, "Yeah"

1215
01:01:08,300 --> 01:01:12,520
I'll tell you about as much truth as the people who wrote that Bible, how's that?

1216
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:23,376
Swearing on the Bible doesn't mean anything

1217
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:25,096
kids, swearing to God is kids' stuff

1218
01:01:25,120 --> 01:01:26,776
remember when you were a kid?

1219
01:01:26,800 --> 01:01:31,076
If you told another kid something he didn't quite believe, he'd say, "Do you swear to God?"

1220
01:01:31,100 --> 01:01:33,856
I would always say, " Yeah, I swear to God"

1221
01:01:33,880 --> 01:01:35,160
even if I was lying

1222
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:38,576
why not? What's gonna happen if I lie?

1223
01:01:38,600 --> 01:01:39,820
Nothing

1224
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:42,336
nothing happens if you lie

1225
01:01:42,360 --> 01:01:44,800
unless you get caught and that's a whole different story

1226
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:50,196
sometimes a kid would think he was being slick with me and he would say.

1227
01:01:50,220 --> 01:01:52,476
"You swear on your mother's grave?"

1228
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:54,736
I'd say, "Yeah, why not"

1229
01:01:54,760 --> 01:01:57,456
first of all, my mother was alive, she didn't even have a grave

1230
01:01:57,480 --> 01:02:00,276
second of all, even if she was dead

1231
01:02:00,300 --> 01:02:03,496
what's she gonna do? Rise from the grave and come haunt me?

1232
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:05,496
Come and haunt me?

1233
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:07,776
All because I told a lie to an 8 year old?

1234
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:10,420
Get fucking real, will ya?

1235
01:02:17,260 --> 01:02:20,960
Sometimes I would say, "I swear on my mother's tits"

1236
01:02:21,980 --> 01:02:24,756
kids are impressed with things like that

1237
01:02:24,780 --> 01:02:26,976
I mean, I didn't care about my mother's tits either

1238
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
I didn't care if they fell off, fuck her

1239
01:02:29,517 --> 01:02:30,517
not my problem

1240
01:02:30,541 --> 01:02:32,540
they're your tits, ma, you keep an eye on them

1241
01:02:33,860 --> 01:02:35,576
swearing to God doesn't mean anything

1242
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:37,320
swearing on the Bible doesn't mean anything

1243
01:02:37,344 --> 01:02:39,616
you know why? Because Bible or no Bible.

1244
01:02:39,640 --> 01:02:40,996
God or no God

1245
01:02:41,020 --> 01:02:42,996
if it suits their purposes

1246
01:02:43,020 --> 01:02:44,996
people are gonna lie in court

1247
01:02:45,020 --> 01:02:47,656
the police do it all the time

1248
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:49,680
all the time

1249
01:02:50,660 --> 01:02:51,896
yes they do

1250
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:55,296
it's part of their job, to protect, to serve

1251
01:02:55,320 --> 01:02:58,700
and to commit perjury whenever it supports the state's case

1252
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:04,036
swearing on the Bible is just one more way of controlling people and keeping them in line

1253
01:03:04,060 --> 01:03:07,576
and it's one more thing that holds us back as a species

1254
01:03:07,600 --> 01:03:08,936
here's one more item for you

1255
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:10,616
the last in our civics book

1256
01:03:10,640 --> 01:03:11,237
rights

1257
01:03:11,261 --> 01:03:14,476
boy, everyone in this country is always running around yammering about their fucking rights

1258
01:03:14,500 --> 01:03:17,500
I have a right, you have no right, we have a right, they don't have a right

1259
01:03:17,524 --> 01:03:19,296
folks, I hate to spoil your fun but,

1260
01:03:19,320 --> 01:03:21,296
there's no such thing as rights, okay?

1261
01:03:21,320 --> 01:03:22,456
They are imaginary

1262
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:23,357
we made them up

1263
01:03:23,381 --> 01:03:24,880
like the boogeyman.

1264
01:03:25,740 --> 01:03:28,636
The Three Little Pigs, Pinocchio, Mother Goose, shit like that

1265
01:03:28,660 --> 01:03:31,096
rights are an idea, they're just imaginary

1266
01:03:31,120 --> 01:03:32,196
they're cute ideas

1267
01:03:32,220 --> 01:03:34,836
cute, but that's all, cute and fictional

1268
01:03:34,860 --> 01:03:36,636
but if you think you do have rights

1269
01:03:36,660 --> 01:03:37,776
let me ask you this

1270
01:03:37,800 --> 01:03:38,836
where do they come from?

1271
01:03:38,860 --> 01:03:41,476
People say, "well, they come from God, they're God given rights"

1272
01:03:41,500 --> 01:03:43,476
oh, fuck, here we go again

1273
01:03:43,500 --> 01:03:45,500
here we go again

1274
01:03:46,040 --> 01:03:50,756
the God excuse, the last refuge of a man with no answers and no arguments

1275
01:03:50,780 --> 01:03:52,196
they came from God

1276
01:03:52,220 --> 01:03:53,436
anything we can't describe

1277
01:03:53,460 --> 01:03:54,776
must have come from God

1278
01:03:54,800 --> 01:03:56,516
personally folks, I believe

1279
01:03:56,540 --> 01:03:58,236
that if your rights came from God

1280
01:03:58,260 --> 01:04:00,676
he would've given you the right to some food everyday

1281
01:04:00,700 --> 01:04:03,140
and he would've given you the right to a roof over your head.

1282
01:04:03,164 --> 01:04:05,080
God would have been looking out for ya!

1283
01:04:05,180 --> 01:04:07,416
God would have been looking out for ya

1284
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:09,440
you know that

1285
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:17,340
he would have been worried about making sure you have a gun so that you get drunk on Sunday night and kill your girlfriend's parents

1286
01:04:17,940 --> 01:04:21,196
but let's say it's true, let's say God gave us these rights

1287
01:04:21,220 --> 01:04:24,056
why would he give us a certain number of rights?

1288
01:04:24,080 --> 01:04:27,676
The Bill of Rights in this country has 10 stipulations, okay?

1289
01:04:27,700 --> 01:04:29,076
Ten rights

1290
01:04:29,100 --> 01:04:32,496
and apparently, God was doing sloppy work that week because

1291
01:04:32,520 --> 01:04:36,276
we've had to amend the Bill of Rights an additional 17 times

1292
01:04:36,300 --> 01:04:39,156
so God forgot a couple of things like

1293
01:04:39,180 --> 01:04:40,540
slavery

1294
01:04:41,380 --> 01:04:43,740
just fucking slipped his mind

1295
01:04:45,160 --> 01:04:46,656
but let's say

1296
01:04:46,680 --> 01:04:48,936
let's say God gave us the original ten

1297
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:50,936
he gave the British 13

1298
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:53,696
the British Bill of Rights has 13 stipulations

1299
01:04:53,720 --> 01:04:55,696
the Germans have 29

1300
01:04:55,720 --> 01:04:57,636
the Belgians have 25

1301
01:04:57,660 --> 01:04:59,296
the Swedish have only 6

1302
01:04:59,320 --> 01:05:01,956
and some people in the world have no rights at all

1303
01:05:01,980 --> 01:05:05,596
what kind of a fucking goddamn God given deal is that?

1304
01:05:05,620 --> 01:05:07,976
No rights at all?

1305
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:13,696
Why would God give different people in different countries different numbers of different rights?

1306
01:05:13,720 --> 01:05:14,597
Boredom?

1307
01:05:14,621 --> 01:05:16,596
Amusement?

1308
01:05:16,620 --> 01:05:18,596
Bad arithmetic?

1309
01:05:18,620 --> 01:05:24,240
Do we find out at long last after all that time that God is weak in math skills?

1310
01:05:24,900 --> 01:05:27,816
Doesn't sound like divine planning to me

1311
01:05:27,840 --> 01:05:30,316
sounds more like human planning

1312
01:05:30,340 --> 01:05:33,536
sounds more like one group trying to control another group

1313
01:05:33,560 --> 01:05:35,316
in other words, business as usual

1314
01:05:35,340 --> 01:05:36,396
in America

1315
01:05:36,420 --> 01:05:37,257
now

1316
01:05:37,281 --> 01:05:40,316
if you think you do have rights, one last assignment for ya

1317
01:05:40,340 --> 01:05:41,836
next time you're at the computer

1318
01:05:41,860 --> 01:05:43,096
get on the internet

1319
01:05:43,120 --> 01:05:44,516
go to Wikipedia

1320
01:05:44,540 --> 01:05:45,576
when you get to Wikipedia

1321
01:05:45,600 --> 01:05:47,196
in the search field for Wikipedia

1322
01:05:47,220 --> 01:05:48,376
I want you to type in

1323
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:51,416
Japanese Americans 1942

1324
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:54,880
and you'll find out all about your precious fucking rights, okay?

1325
01:05:55,160 --> 01:05:56,516
Alright

1326
01:05:56,540 --> 01:05:58,516
you know about it

1327
01:05:58,540 --> 01:06:00,540
you know about it

1328
01:06:02,340 --> 01:06:06,696
in 1942, there were a hundred and ten thousand

1329
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:11,476
Japanese American citizens in good standing, law abiding people

1330
01:06:11,500 --> 01:06:14,216
who were thrown into internment camps

1331
01:06:14,240 --> 01:06:16,396
simply because their parents were born

1332
01:06:16,420 --> 01:06:17,836
in the wrong country

1333
01:06:17,860 --> 01:06:20,316
that's all they did wrong, they had no right to a lawyer

1334
01:06:20,340 --> 01:06:21,856
no right to a fair trial

1335
01:06:21,880 --> 01:06:23,476
no right to a jury of their peers

1336
01:06:23,500 --> 01:06:26,036
no right to do process of any kind

1337
01:06:26,060 --> 01:06:27,436
the only right they had

1338
01:06:27,460 --> 01:06:29,460
right this way!

1339
01:06:29,800 --> 01:06:31,736
Into the internment camps

1340
01:06:31,760 --> 01:06:34,096
just when these American citizens

1341
01:06:34,120 --> 01:06:36,096
needed their rights the most

1342
01:06:36,120 --> 01:06:37,436
their government

1343
01:06:37,460 --> 01:06:38,556
took them away

1344
01:06:38,580 --> 01:06:42,256
and rights aren't rights if someone can take them away

1345
01:06:42,280 --> 01:06:43,456
they're privileges

1346
01:06:43,480 --> 01:06:47,120
that's all we ever had in this country is a Bill of temporary

1347
01:06:47,260 --> 01:06:50,396
privileges that if you read the news even badly

1348
01:06:50,420 --> 01:06:51,676
you'd know that every year

1349
01:06:51,700 --> 01:06:54,716
the list gets shorter and shorter and shorter

1350
01:06:54,740 --> 01:06:56,740
you see how slimmer it is?

1351
01:07:02,220 --> 01:07:03,256
Yeah

1352
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:08,416
sooner or later, the people in this country are gonna realize the government does not give a fuck about them

1353
01:07:08,440 --> 01:07:13,256
the government does not care about you or your children or your rights or your welfare or your safety

1354
01:07:13,280 --> 01:07:15,496
it simply doesn't give a fuck about you

1355
01:07:15,520 --> 01:07:18,276
it's interested in its own power, that's the only thing

1356
01:07:18,300 --> 01:07:20,736
keeping it and expanding it whenever possible

1357
01:07:20,760 --> 01:07:22,396
personally, when it comes to rights

1358
01:07:22,420 --> 01:07:24,456
I think one of two things is true

1359
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:27,136
I think either we have unlimited rights

1360
01:07:27,160 --> 01:07:29,136
or we have no rights at all

1361
01:07:29,160 --> 01:07:32,156
personally, I lean towards unlimited rights

1362
01:07:32,180 --> 01:07:35,916
I feel, for instance, I have the right to do anything I please

1363
01:07:35,940 --> 01:07:38,716
but, if I do something you don't like

1364
01:07:38,740 --> 01:07:40,920
I think you have the right to kill me

1365
01:07:41,840 --> 01:07:45,560
so where are you gonna find a fairer fucking deal than that?

1366
01:07:45,880 --> 01:07:49,716
So the next time some asshole says to you, " I have a right to my opinion"

1367
01:07:49,740 --> 01:07:54,536
you say, "oh yeah? Well, I have a right to my opinion and my opinion is that you have no right to your opinion"

1368
01:07:54,560 --> 01:07:57,936
then shoot the fuck and walk away

1369
01:07:57,960 --> 01:07:59,960
thank you
