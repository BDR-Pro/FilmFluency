[muffled indistinct chatter]

8
00:01:15,311 --> 00:01:16,312
[man] ...push.

9
00:01:30,158 --> 00:01:32,035
[high-pitched ringing]

10
00:01:33,245 --> 00:01:34,996
- [woman] He hit his head.
- [man] He did not.

11
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:37,290
- [woman] Did he hit his head?
- [man] I caught him in time.

12
00:01:37,374 --> 00:01:39,126
[woman] But he hit the floor. I saw him.

13
00:01:39,209 --> 00:01:41,044
- Dropped him.
- [man] I promise you, he's fine.

14
00:01:41,128 --> 00:01:42,921
- [woman] Why isn't he crying?
- [snipping]

15
00:01:43,004 --> 00:01:45,674
- He should be crying, right?
- [man] He will be crying in no time.

16
00:01:45,757 --> 00:01:48,008
[woman] Where are you taking him?
Where are you taking him?

17
00:01:48,926 --> 00:01:53,347
What is...? What is wrong?
Why isn't he breathing?

18
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:57,059
- Did you kill him?! Did you kill my baby?!
- [man] No!

19
00:01:57,893 --> 00:01:59,603
- [woman] Did you drop him?
- [man] No!

20
00:01:59,687 --> 00:02:02,189
- [woman] You made me have him.
- [man] Nurse, are you getting him?

21
00:02:02,273 --> 00:02:03,983
[nurse] Yes, we are. We vacuumed him.

22
00:02:04,066 --> 00:02:06,068
[woman screaming indistinctly]

23
00:02:09,822 --> 00:02:11,407
[woman] Why are you flinging him?

24
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:13,159
[repeated slapping]

[inhales, then exhales]

28
00:03:06,501 --> 00:03:09,004
I accidentally drank mouthwash
Friday night.

29
00:03:12,174 --> 00:03:13,800
You can't get stomach cancer that way.

30
00:03:14,843 --> 00:03:16,469
Not from one time.

31
00:03:17,553 --> 00:03:20,223
I drank a mouthful a couple weeks ago too.

32
00:03:21,474 --> 00:03:22,892
I'm sure it's fine.

33
00:03:23,976 --> 00:03:26,312
[cell phone ringing and buzzing]

34
00:03:36,197 --> 00:03:38,199
[ringing and buzzing continues]

35
00:03:47,374 --> 00:03:49,376
I'm visiting my mother tomorrow.

36
00:03:49,459 --> 00:03:53,338
I know you are. Your father's anniversary.

37
00:03:54,714 --> 00:03:55,840
The day he died.

38
00:03:58,093 --> 00:03:59,719
How you feeling about that?

39
00:04:02,806 --> 00:04:05,183
You know. I never met him.

40
00:04:06,476 --> 00:04:09,854
I meant, how you feeling about going home?

41
00:04:10,605 --> 00:04:11,606
[cell phone chimes]

42
00:04:17,278 --> 00:04:18,737
I had the dream again.

43
00:04:20,781 --> 00:04:22,449
[Friel] <i>Let's stay on track.</i>

44
00:04:23,325 --> 00:04:26,120
How are you feeling about the trip?

45
00:04:29,164 --> 00:04:30,499
It's good I'm going back.

46
00:04:32,251 --> 00:04:33,377
It's been a long time.

47
00:04:35,504 --> 00:04:36,547
Has it?

48
00:04:38,632 --> 00:04:40,301
Several months.

49
00:04:41,885 --> 00:04:44,137
Are you feeling guilty about that?

50
00:04:56,232 --> 00:04:57,317
And, um...

51
00:04:58,901 --> 00:05:00,528
when you're out there,

52
00:05:01,195 --> 00:05:03,990
are you going with any sense of a plan?

53
00:05:04,782 --> 00:05:06,492
Hoping for a certain outcome?

54
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:09,912
Like what?

55
00:05:11,873 --> 00:05:15,250
Do you feel like you're going
with realistic expectations?

56
00:05:22,132 --> 00:05:23,967
If the last time you were thirsty,

57
00:05:24,051 --> 00:05:26,678
you went to a well
and the water made you sick,

58
00:05:26,762 --> 00:05:29,014
are you gonna go back
to that specific well,

59
00:05:29,097 --> 00:05:30,891
expecting it to be safe?

60
00:05:39,274 --> 00:05:40,233
Mm.

61
00:05:50,701 --> 00:05:53,120
Do you ever wish that she was dead?

62
00:05:53,204 --> 00:05:55,706
What? Of course not.

63
00:05:56,916 --> 00:05:59,752
But it wouldn't be so crazy if you did.

64
00:05:59,835 --> 00:06:03,214
We can sort of want these things
and also not want them at all.

65
00:06:03,798 --> 00:06:06,050
Those feelings can coexist.

66
00:06:06,675 --> 00:06:10,429
We're here so we can air
those kinds of thoughts.

67
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:13,181
Okay.

68
00:06:17,268 --> 00:06:20,146
How's the Hydrotipnol?
Still making the eyes itchy?

69
00:06:21,147 --> 00:06:23,233
Only if I don't keep blinking.

70
00:06:23,316 --> 00:06:24,776
Is it helping the anxiety?

71
00:06:27,153 --> 00:06:28,363
Um...

72
00:06:29,531 --> 00:06:30,740
Tell you what.

73
00:06:30,824 --> 00:06:35,745
I'm gonna write you a scrip
for a very cool new drug,

74
00:06:36,663 --> 00:06:43,043
which, I think,
should be smoother on all fronts.

75
00:06:46,422 --> 00:06:47,923
Always with water.

76
00:06:48,716 --> 00:06:53,595
Always. And if your breathing changes
or you feel warm, call me immediately.

77
00:06:53,679 --> 00:06:55,389
That's serious.

78
00:06:55,472 --> 00:06:56,557
Break a leg.

- That one?
- [man yells] You think I won't?

88
00:07:32,467 --> 00:07:34,385
Do you fucking want me to do it?

89
00:07:36,262 --> 00:07:37,263
Oh, yeah?

Excuse me!

92
00:07:41,975 --> 00:07:44,102
[Beau] Excuse me. What is that man doing?

93
00:07:44,811 --> 00:07:47,147
We're trying to get him to jump. [laughs]

Get away from me!

You get away from me!

Get away!

103
00:08:23,974 --> 00:08:26,352
You look like a minestrone man.

104
00:08:26,435 --> 00:08:27,311
[man 2] Stay away!

105
00:08:27,394 --> 00:08:30,397

- [Grace gasps] Oh, Beau.

705
00:58:57,860 --> 00:58:59,987
[Roger] You aren't healed, my dude.

706
00:59:00,571 --> 00:59:01,905
Not to mention...

707
00:59:03,574 --> 00:59:04,950
Maybe there's a way.

708
00:59:05,951 --> 00:59:09,329
Since you're busy, maybe I can...
I can fly.

709
00:59:09,413 --> 00:59:11,914
I fly and I can pay you back
when I get my credit card.

710
00:59:11,998 --> 00:59:15,251
It isn't about the money, Beau.
You can't fly with your wounds.

711
00:59:15,334 --> 00:59:17,837
The air pressure will rip you wide open.

712
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:20,506
Maybe I can take a bus.
I can take a bus. Can I take a bus?

713
00:59:20,590 --> 00:59:22,884
I could take a train. Or a cab?

714
00:59:22,967 --> 00:59:24,886
Beau, we're responsible for you.

715
00:59:24,969 --> 00:59:28,139
Driving you home
is the absolute least we can do.

716
00:59:28,222 --> 00:59:31,434
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

717
00:59:31,517 --> 00:59:34,645
I'm sorry, but I have to go today.
I have to go today.

718
00:59:34,729 --> 00:59:36,022
I don't wanna impose.

719
00:59:36,105 --> 00:59:39,066
Going tomorrow won't be an imposition.

720
00:59:39,150 --> 00:59:41,318
It'll be my pleasure.

721
00:59:41,401 --> 00:59:42,652
Okay?

722
00:59:49,659 --> 00:59:50,911
Okay.

723
00:59:53,330 --> 00:59:54,331
Is it, Beau?

724
00:59:56,333 --> 00:59:57,667
Don't just say that.

725
01:00:00,086 --> 01:00:01,588
This is your decision.

Thanks, pal. You're a trouper.
Sorry for the curveball, Beau.

728
01:00:18,145 --> 01:00:20,689
Wait, don't you need to stitch me up?

729
01:00:20,773 --> 01:00:21,774
Ah, it's fine.

730
01:00:21,857 --> 01:00:24,693
Just cut back on the jumping jacks,
you know what I mean?

731
01:00:24,777 --> 01:00:27,613
In the meantime, my man,
this is your home.

732
01:00:28,239 --> 01:00:30,074
I need to run too, sweetie.

733
01:00:30,741 --> 01:00:31,867
- There's...
- [Roger] Oh!

734
01:00:32,743 --> 01:00:34,245
And I'm giving Jeeves his medicine,

735
01:00:34,328 --> 01:00:36,580
so if you hear him screaming,
he's just asleep.

736
01:00:38,541 --> 01:00:40,834
- Don't forget to hydrate.
- What?

737
01:00:42,252 --> 01:00:43,711
[Grace] Drink lots of water.

738
01:00:43,795 --> 01:00:45,964
[Roger] We're taking you back tomorrow!

739
01:00:46,047 --> 01:00:47,173
[Grace] Goodbye, sweetie.

740
01:00:48,341 --> 01:00:49,342
[Roger] Tomorrow.

741
01:00:54,556 --> 01:00:55,557
What?

742
01:00:56,808 --> 01:00:58,226
What does this mean?

743
01:00:59,936 --> 01:01:01,855
Wait! What does that mean?

744
01:01:01,938 --> 01:01:03,189
[Roger] Shake a leg.

Aren't you a little old

Please. I really can't do this.

- You can't even pay for it.

873
01:09:01,275 --> 01:09:03,277
[shower running]

874
01:09:04,403 --> 01:09:06,238
[girl] There's a dead man in the pool!

875
01:09:07,865 --> 01:09:09,742
There's a dead man in the pool!

876
01:09:12,453 --> 01:09:13,746
[pounding on door]

877
01:09:13,829 --> 01:09:15,706
There's a dead man in the pool!

878
01:09:17,207 --> 01:09:19,043
There's a dead man in the pool!

879
01:09:21,003 --> 01:09:22,838
There's a dead man in the pool!

880
01:09:27,383 --> 01:09:29,886
[pounding on door]

881
01:09:29,969 --> 01:09:31,637
There's a dead man in the pool!

882
01:09:31,721 --> 01:09:33,097
So, you're just here with your mom?

883
01:09:33,181 --> 01:09:36,768
[Young Beau] Only sometimes.
Right now I'm by myself.

884
01:09:37,894 --> 01:09:39,062
I'm Elaine.

885
01:09:39,145 --> 01:09:40,229
I'm Beau.

886
01:09:40,313 --> 01:09:41,314
I'm Elaine.

887
01:09:42,023 --> 01:09:44,442
[Young Beau]
Are you here with your mother?

888
01:09:44,525 --> 01:09:45,360
[Elaine] Yeah.

889
01:09:45,985 --> 01:09:48,863
She got me, and my dad
got our rich whore neighbor,

890
01:09:48,946 --> 01:09:52,617
who he's probably fucking right now
on a pile of her slut money in Aruba.

891
01:09:53,450 --> 01:09:56,244
Here, take a picture of me and Gene.

892
01:10:02,834 --> 01:10:05,253
[camera clicks, then whirs]

893
01:10:06,046 --> 01:10:08,256
[Mona] <i>Is that the type of girl
you're attracted to?</i>

894
01:10:09,800 --> 01:10:10,801
[Young Beau] <i>No.</i>

895
01:10:13,095 --> 01:10:16,264
[Mona] <i>Because I've noticed you
noticing certain types.</i>

896
01:10:19,851 --> 01:10:21,103
It's okay if you are.

897
01:10:22,728 --> 01:10:24,397
You don't have to feel embarrassed.

898
01:10:25,773 --> 01:10:26,774
I'm not.

899
01:10:34,615 --> 01:10:35,866
[Mona] She's very pretty.

900
01:10:37,159 --> 01:10:38,285
Very natural.

901
01:10:40,704 --> 01:10:42,331
You could ask my advice, you know.

902
01:10:44,875 --> 01:10:46,460
Only women know women.

903
01:10:48,045 --> 01:10:49,296
That's the truth.

904
01:10:50,673 --> 01:10:52,048
Men are blind.

905
01:10:53,466 --> 01:10:55,969
That's not a criticism.
That's their charm.

906
01:10:57,637 --> 01:10:59,097
Don't be defensive.

907
01:11:01,599 --> 01:11:03,685
I'm proud of the man you are.

908
01:11:05,687 --> 01:11:06,688
Hey.

909
01:11:11,860 --> 01:11:13,862
I'm proud of the man you are.

910
01:11:25,038 --> 01:11:26,415
A girl like that...

911
01:11:27,749 --> 01:11:30,669
Confident, self-possessed.

912
01:11:35,632 --> 01:11:37,551
A man would have to match her.

913
01:11:41,305 --> 01:11:42,389
But you could.

914
01:11:44,975 --> 01:11:46,518
She should be so lucky.

915
01:11:49,771 --> 01:11:51,564
Any woman would be so lucky.

916
01:11:55,610 --> 01:11:58,070
You just have to commit completely.

917
01:12:02,158 --> 01:12:06,787
<i>Nothing in life is more important
than choosing the right companion.</i>

918
01:12:11,167 --> 01:12:13,961
Hey, my dude. Long time no see.

919
01:12:14,045 --> 01:12:15,963
- How was your day?
- [Grace] How are you feeling?

920
01:12:16,047 --> 01:12:21,510
Oh, good, you're already in your PJs.
Well, we're hot on your tail. [chuckles]

921
01:12:21,593 --> 01:12:23,345
[Mona] <i>I think I might go to bed early.</i>

922
01:12:24,930 --> 01:12:25,931
[Young Beau] Okay.

923
01:12:27,516 --> 01:12:28,975
[Mona] I haven't decided yet.

924
01:12:33,230 --> 01:12:36,149
Unless you'd rather I stay up.

925
01:12:37,943 --> 01:12:40,987
We could stroll around the deck.

926
01:12:42,572 --> 01:12:43,865
Go stargazing.

927
01:12:48,036 --> 01:12:49,119
I'll go to bed.

928
01:12:58,629 --> 01:12:59,755
What about éclairs?

929
01:13:00,422 --> 01:13:02,341
People hide razors in them.

930
01:13:04,134 --> 01:13:05,594
What about rainbow cake?

931
01:13:06,220 --> 01:13:08,138
The colors make cancer.

932
01:13:09,223 --> 01:13:11,725
What about liquid shit?

933
01:13:12,935 --> 01:13:15,563
[tense music playing]

934
01:13:15,646 --> 01:13:17,064
Do you think your mom's a cunt?

935
01:13:18,439 --> 01:13:19,440
What do you mean?

936
01:13:19,524 --> 01:13:22,610
Well, it's okay. My mom's a complete cunt.

937
01:13:24,320 --> 01:13:25,154
Are you a virgin?

938
01:13:27,907 --> 01:13:31,536
Well, it doesn't matter.
I am too. I mean, who gives a shit?

939
01:13:33,871 --> 01:13:34,956
I have to.

940
01:13:35,832 --> 01:13:39,085
It's very dangerous for me. It's genetic.

941
01:13:40,211 --> 01:13:41,588
My father died.

942
01:13:44,382 --> 01:13:45,383
Here.

943
01:13:46,175 --> 01:13:47,426
- Suck this off.
- What?

944
01:13:51,972 --> 01:13:52,806
What?

945
01:13:55,183 --> 01:13:56,476
What?

946
01:14:00,022 --> 01:14:01,690
We're allowed to kiss.

947
01:14:04,026 --> 01:14:05,110
Who is?

948
01:14:05,193 --> 01:14:07,529
- But only for the next ten seconds.
- What do you mean?

949
01:14:07,613 --> 01:14:09,031
Ten. Nine.

950
01:14:09,114 --> 01:14:10,574
- Eight. Seven.
- What? Wait.

951
01:14:10,657 --> 01:14:12,284
- Six. Five.
- We're allowed to...?

952
01:14:12,367 --> 01:14:13,994
- Four. Three.
- Can you just explain?

953
01:14:14,077 --> 01:14:17,079
Two. One. One and a half.
One and three-quarters.

954
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:19,081
I'm sorry.

955
01:14:19,915 --> 01:14:21,167
Elaine!

956
01:14:22,710 --> 01:14:24,086
Shit. Fuck. I gotta go.

957
01:14:24,170 --> 01:14:26,130
Okay. I'm sorry.

958
01:14:26,213 --> 01:14:28,299
- Tomorrow?
- Now!

959
01:14:28,382 --> 01:14:30,635
- [gasps]
- [Toni] You should be in my bed!

960
01:14:32,470 --> 01:14:35,931
He's breaking your rules! Hypocrite!

961
01:14:36,015 --> 01:14:38,225
[Roger yells]
You wanna test me, young lady?

962
01:14:45,107 --> 01:14:46,399
Jeeves!

963
01:14:46,483 --> 01:14:47,776
He's inside!

964
01:14:48,777 --> 01:14:50,403
Beau's inside!

965
01:14:50,487 --> 01:14:52,155
[pounding on door]

966
01:14:52,238 --> 01:14:55,325
- Beau, Beau, Beau. They're taking me away.
- [screaming]

967
01:14:55,408 --> 01:14:58,203
Beau, wake up. She's taking me away.
She's taking me off the ship.

968
01:14:58,286 --> 01:15:00,246
- [Mona] What's happening?
- She's taking me away.

969
01:15:00,330 --> 01:15:02,165
- Will you wait for me?
- [Mona] What is going on?

970
01:15:02,248 --> 01:15:04,417
- Will you wait for me?
- [Young Beau] What's happening?

971
01:15:04,501 --> 01:15:05,502
I love you.

972
01:15:06,503 --> 01:15:07,754
[Mona] Oh, my God.

973
01:15:07,837 --> 01:15:09,130
Why are you doing this?

974
01:15:09,214 --> 01:15:10,340
What is this?

975
01:15:10,924 --> 01:15:12,550
- Will you wait for me?
- Yes.

976
01:15:12,634 --> 01:15:14,760
Promise? Do you promise? Promise me!

977
01:15:14,843 --> 01:15:16,095
- Okay?
- I promise.

978
01:15:16,178 --> 01:15:17,763
- Enough!
- Who is this bitch?

979
01:15:17,846 --> 01:15:19,139
- [woman] I'm sorry.
- What is this?

980
01:15:19,223 --> 01:15:22,226
No! No! No!

981
01:15:22,309 --> 01:15:23,686
Beau, I love you, okay?

982
01:15:23,769 --> 01:15:26,146
- Come here right now!
- Wait for me. Wait for me, okay?

983
01:15:26,230 --> 01:15:27,690
- Shut up!
- Oh, my God!

984
01:15:28,357 --> 01:15:30,025
- [Elaine] Wait for me!
- [Mona] My heart.

985
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:34,196
- My heart. My heart.
- [woman] What's wrong with you?

986
01:15:34,279 --> 01:15:35,948
[Mona] What did you promise her, Beau?

987
01:15:36,031 --> 01:15:37,282
[Mona gasping]

988
01:15:37,366 --> 01:15:38,283
Beau!

989
01:15:38,367 --> 01:15:41,120
Where is she going, Beau? Was she the one?

990
01:15:41,203 --> 01:15:42,705
[Roger] <i>No, no! Put that down!</i>

991
01:15:42,788 --> 01:15:45,832
- He's on the couch!
- [Jeeves] He's inside!

992
01:15:45,915 --> 01:15:47,333
[lamp shatters]

993
01:15:47,417 --> 01:15:48,751
[Grace] Okay, okay, okay.

994
01:15:48,835 --> 01:15:50,962
That's him! That's him!

995
01:15:51,045 --> 01:15:52,380
- [Jeeves yells]
- [Grace] Oh!

996
01:15:52,463 --> 01:15:54,841
- That's enough!
- [Roger] No need to get up, Beau!

997
01:15:54,924 --> 01:15:57,260
- Stay in bed! Stay in bed!
- [Grace] All right.

998
01:15:57,343 --> 01:15:59,429
[tense music playing]

999
01:15:59,512 --> 01:16:02,640
He's laughing! He's laughing!

1000
01:16:02,724 --> 01:16:05,518
- He's laughing!
- Don't worry, Beau. False alarm.

1001
01:16:05,601 --> 01:16:07,895
[Grace] It's okay, Beau.
He doesn't know what he's doing.

1002
01:16:07,979 --> 01:16:09,480
It's all under control.

1003
01:16:09,564 --> 01:16:11,065
- Okay.
- [Jeeves] He's laughing!

1004
01:16:11,149 --> 01:16:12,858
[Grace]
When they rescued him in the jungle,

1005
01:16:12,941 --> 01:16:15,610
they found him running around,
shooting at the bodies.

1006
01:16:15,694 --> 01:16:18,196
And not at...
Not the enemy, his own squad too.

1007
01:16:18,280 --> 01:16:19,656
[Roger] His own squad, Beau.

1008
01:16:19,740 --> 01:16:22,325
[Grace]
He was defending himself. He still is.

1009
01:16:22,409 --> 01:16:25,287
He's a hero and he came back to nothing.

1010
01:16:25,370 --> 01:16:27,205
We're the only ones who would take him in.

1011
01:16:27,289 --> 01:16:29,416
[Roger] He's gonna be so ashamed
in the morning, Beau.

1012
01:16:29,499 --> 01:16:31,168
Mark my words.

1013
01:16:31,251 --> 01:16:32,753
He loves you.

1014
01:16:32,836 --> 01:16:35,630
[fading] He told me he loves you.
He told me yesterday.

1015
01:16:35,714 --> 01:16:39,634
[unsettling music playing]

1016
01:16:39,718 --> 01:16:42,219
[Grace]
That's not part of the original contract.

1017
01:16:43,220 --> 01:16:45,014
I'm a mother myself, you know.

1018
01:16:45,598 --> 01:16:47,641
In that case, I might have to...

1019
01:16:47,725 --> 01:16:50,311
Look alive, pal! It's grill time.

1020
01:16:50,394 --> 01:16:52,688
I thought we'd have
a little goodbye barbecue

1021
01:16:52,772 --> 01:16:54,398
before we hit the road.

1022
01:16:54,482 --> 01:16:55,357
What?

1023
01:16:55,441 --> 01:16:57,026
You got the tri-tip.

1024
01:16:59,236 --> 01:17:01,781
Good morning, sweetheart.
How are you feeling?

1025
01:17:01,864 --> 01:17:04,116
- [Roger] You coming, Gracey?
- Right there.

1026
01:17:07,119 --> 01:17:08,204
Let's get you up.

1027
01:17:09,246 --> 01:17:11,998
- [groans]
- Oh! Oh, oh, oh. Shh. Shh. Shh.

1028
01:17:14,709 --> 01:17:15,710
Baby.

1029
01:17:16,294 --> 01:17:18,254
There you go. There we go.

1030
01:17:24,344 --> 01:17:27,430
As someone who sees you and loves you
and knows what you're going through,

1031
01:17:27,514 --> 01:17:30,725
even though I know I can never know,
I have to tell you...

1032
01:17:30,809 --> 01:17:31,810
[Roger] Babers?

1033
01:17:33,853 --> 01:17:37,148
You mind coming out here for a sec?
I need a hand.

1034
01:17:37,232 --> 01:17:38,316
Of course.

1035
01:17:40,359 --> 01:17:42,611
Why don't you find something to watch?

1036
01:17:43,779 --> 01:17:44,947
I'll be right back.

1037
01:17:47,074 --> 01:17:48,158
Channel 78.

1038
01:19:13,991 --> 01:19:15,075
[Toni screams] Now!

1039
01:19:16,577 --> 01:19:18,203
What? What is...?

1040
01:19:19,038 --> 01:19:19,872
What?

1041
01:19:21,332 --> 01:19:22,750
What? What?

1042
01:19:23,626 --> 01:19:25,794
We're gonna finally put some color
on these walls.

1043
01:19:26,712 --> 01:19:27,755
What?

1044
01:19:34,720 --> 01:19:36,347
Here. Take that wall.

1045

Yeah, how about this?

1048
01:19:51,277 --> 01:19:53,029
Please. What...?

1049
01:19:53,780 --> 01:19:56,366
What are you doing?
Why are you doing this?

1050
01:19:57,951 --> 01:20:02,205
- Hey, Grace is so careful about this room.
- It's my brother!

1051
01:20:05,917 --> 01:20:08,627
I know. So, why?

1052
01:20:12,881 --> 01:20:13,882
Okay.

[Toni] Yeah, you know what?

1055
01:20:18,428 --> 01:20:19,930
You'll just get fucked up with me.

1056
01:20:20,013 --> 01:20:22,849
- I'm supposed to be leaving.
- So, you'll leave fucked up.

1057
01:20:22,933 --> 01:20:24,810
No, I feel really bad right now, please!

1058
01:20:24,893 --> 01:20:27,938
So, what, you can come into my life
and sleep in my bed

1059
01:20:28,021 --> 01:20:31,942
and steal my fucking parents,
but you can't get fucked up with me?

1060
01:20:32,025 --> 01:20:34,528
No! I'm not trying
to steal anything, I swear!

1061
01:20:34,611 --> 01:20:38,155
No, you've already blown it!
You failed your stupid test!

1062
01:20:39,615 --> 01:20:40,741
What?

1063
01:20:40,825 --> 01:20:43,035
Everyone pretending
you're some sad, old orphan.

1064

- Wait. Wait. What do you mean?

1065

I'm sorry. Please...

1066
01:20:47,957 --> 01:20:50,376
I'll leave. I'll do whatever you want.
But what does that mean?

1067
01:20:50,459 --> 01:20:53,087
- What do you mean, a test?
- No one is asking you to leave.

1068
01:20:53,170 --> 01:20:56,382
I'm asking you to fucking drink
this fucking paint with me.

1069
01:20:56,465 --> 01:20:58,634
- Toni, please.
- Don't call me Toni!

1070
01:20:58,718 --> 01:21:00,219
I'm sorry, but it's your name.

1071
01:21:00,302 --> 01:21:02,972
It is my name. It's my name.

1072
01:21:03,055 --> 01:21:05,890
What did you mean
when you said that about the test?

1073
01:21:05,974 --> 01:21:08,977
- What does that mean?
- I don't care! You first.

1074
01:21:10,770 --> 01:21:12,313
Don't. Toni, please.

1075
01:21:12,397 --> 01:21:13,857
You listen to me.

1076
01:21:15,066 --> 01:21:18,778
I have videos of you. I'll post them.
I'll say what you did.

1077
01:21:18,862 --> 01:21:22,741
What? What did I do? What did I do?

1078
01:21:25,577 --> 01:21:29,039
- Fine, you fucking pussy, faggot.
- No, please, Toni, don't!

1079

Can I take it out?

01:47:09,191 --> 01:47:12,361
for one bowl of soup,
but before he could spend it,

1383
01:47:12,444 --> 01:47:14,780
he was invited to a special play.

1384
01:47:15,405 --> 01:47:18,909
It was already in progress,
but he felt compelled to go in,

1385
01:47:19,576 --> 01:47:21,702
and so he spent his last dollar.

1386
01:47:22,912 --> 01:47:27,667
Not long after sitting in,
he saw that the details of the plot

1387
01:47:27,750 --> 01:47:32,004
were impossibly similar
to those of his own life.

1388
01:47:32,838 --> 01:47:35,716
And there were three young men
on the stage

1389
01:47:35,800 --> 01:47:38,344
who looked remarkably like himself.

1390
01:47:38,427 --> 01:47:39,679
This is me!

1391
01:47:39,762 --> 01:47:44,433
And he rose up, at once exhilarated
and terrified that it might not be true,

1392
01:47:44,517 --> 01:47:47,603
- and he announced...
- This is my story!

1393
01:47:48,729 --> 01:47:53,441
And the three young men immediately
recognized the man as their father.

1394
01:47:53,525 --> 01:47:56,319
- Dad?
- No. It can't be.

1395
01:47:56,403 --> 01:47:58,071
[Beau] My sons.

1396
01:48:02,575 --> 01:48:03,576
[boy 1] Dad?

1397
01:48:04,828 --> 01:48:06,413
Dad. Dad...

1398
01:48:07,205 --> 01:48:08,999
- [Beau] Oh...
- [boy 1 sobbing]

1399
01:48:09,082 --> 01:48:10,292
Oh, my God.

1400
01:48:11,376 --> 01:48:12,419
Oh, my God.

1401
01:48:13,962 --> 01:48:16,423
- [boy 2] Oh, my God.
- You're my boys.

1402
01:48:16,506 --> 01:48:21,677
Oh, my beautiful, sweet boys.
Don't be afraid. Come here. Come here.

1403
01:48:22,386 --> 01:48:28,475
Come here. Oh, my... Oh, my God. Oh!

1404
01:48:29,518 --> 01:48:32,479
Where have you been?

1405
01:48:35,149 --> 01:48:37,943
You were ripped from me.

1406
01:48:38,027 --> 01:48:42,197
I've looked for you for so long.

1407
01:48:42,281 --> 01:48:43,907
[sobbing] So long...

1408
01:48:47,870 --> 01:48:50,330
- [boy 1] Where did you go?
- I know you.

1409
01:48:51,039 --> 01:48:54,959
I made you. Oh, my loves.

1410
01:48:55,043 --> 01:48:58,755
- Oh, my loves. Oh, my darlings.
- [boys sobbing]

1411
01:48:58,838 --> 01:49:01,632
- Oh, my darlings.
- [boy 2] I missed you so much.

1412
01:49:01,716 --> 01:49:04,218
Oh. Oh...

1413
01:49:04,302 --> 01:49:06,888
That's okay. It's okay.

1414
01:49:06,971 --> 01:49:09,307
I'm here. I'm here.

1415
01:49:09,932 --> 01:49:12,101
Oh, my loves.

1416
01:49:13,853 --> 01:49:15,021
It's okay.

1417
01:49:18,065 --> 01:49:20,442
What about our mother? Is she...?

1418
01:49:21,568 --> 01:49:23,028
- What?
- Is she...?

1419
01:49:23,945 --> 01:49:25,280
She's not with you?

1420
01:49:27,616 --> 01:49:28,909
She's not with you?

1421
01:49:28,992 --> 01:49:31,703
- Oh, God.
- [boy 3] We were raised as orphans.

1422
01:49:31,787 --> 01:49:33,705
Oh, no.

1423
01:49:33,789 --> 01:49:36,416
Oh, I'm so sorry.

1424
01:49:37,584 --> 01:49:41,046
- [boy 1] Where's Mom?
- [Beau] It's okay, my love. It's okay.

1425
01:49:43,673 --> 01:49:44,716
[boy 1] Mom...

1426
01:49:46,051 --> 01:49:47,093
[boy 2] Is there...?

1427
01:49:48,469 --> 01:49:51,931
Is there any other family?

1428
01:49:53,682 --> 01:49:54,934
Besides us?

1429
01:49:58,687 --> 01:50:00,147
You had a grandmother.

1430
01:50:01,190 --> 01:50:02,233
[boy 2] Where is she?

1431
01:50:06,612 --> 01:50:07,780
Her head...

1432
01:50:09,198 --> 01:50:10,491
And our grandfather?

1433
01:50:14,703 --> 01:50:15,870
[boy 2] How did he die?

1434
01:50:20,291 --> 01:50:23,128
[Mona] He died on our wedding night.

1435
01:50:25,130 --> 01:50:27,424
The same night you were conceived.

1436
01:50:29,342 --> 01:50:33,680
He died the very instant
you were conceived.

1437
01:50:34,806 --> 01:50:35,807
How?

1438
01:50:38,685 --> 01:50:39,853
By finishing.

1439
01:50:41,938 --> 01:50:42,939
Into me.

1440
01:50:45,566 --> 01:50:48,569
He had a heart murmur, just like you.

1441
01:50:50,446 --> 01:50:51,655
Did it hurt?

1442
01:50:53,699 --> 01:50:57,161
I'm sure it was excruciating.

1443
01:50:58,871 --> 01:51:00,956
It was the first time we made love.

1444
01:51:02,708 --> 01:51:07,296
The first time either of us made love,
with anyone.

1445
01:51:10,632 --> 01:51:15,887
Your grandpa and your great-grandpa
died the same way.

1446
01:51:18,639 --> 01:51:20,892
But he thought he might be different.

1447
01:51:22,560 --> 01:51:23,936
I'm just as guilty.

1448
01:51:25,938 --> 01:51:27,148
I urged him on.

1449
01:51:29,275 --> 01:51:31,110
I wanted a normal life.

1450
01:51:33,154 --> 01:51:34,780
I wanted a child.

1451
01:51:41,329 --> 01:51:44,623
He died on top of me.

1452
01:51:46,750 --> 01:51:48,043
Inside.

1453
01:51:50,712 --> 01:51:56,593
I think about it,
and I wanna rip my ears off.

1454
01:51:59,221 --> 01:52:00,222
But then...

1455
01:52:02,891 --> 01:52:05,560
But then, that same trauma...

1456
01:52:07,437 --> 01:52:10,690
which changed me so utterly...

1457
01:52:14,026 --> 01:52:19,031
also resulted
in the greatest gift of my life.

1458
01:52:22,034 --> 01:52:27,373
I am so sorry for what your daddy
passed down to you.

1459
01:52:29,750 --> 01:52:32,419
I can't tell you how sorry I am.

1460
01:52:37,883 --> 01:52:39,093
[boy 1] Is that a lie?

1461
01:52:41,387 --> 01:52:42,387
No.

1462
01:52:46,975 --> 01:52:48,851
[boy 2] Can that really happen?

1463
01:52:52,772 --> 01:52:53,856
Yes.

1464
01:52:56,985 --> 01:52:59,529
It's why I never...

1465
01:53:01,990 --> 01:53:03,157
with anyone.

1466
01:53:05,952 --> 01:53:06,953
[boy 1] Dad...

1467
01:53:08,454 --> 01:53:10,248
you've never been with anyone?

1468
01:53:16,378 --> 01:53:21,717
[boy 2] Then...? Then how did you have us?

1469
01:53:40,735 --> 01:53:44,030
What should I do?
Which limb shall I strike off?

1470
01:53:44,113 --> 01:53:48,117
You might act yesterday,
and it would be decades tardy.

1471
01:53:48,200 --> 01:53:50,161
[Hero] Have I not given all I have?

1472
01:53:50,244 --> 01:53:53,331
- All you have?
- You have given trifles.

1473
01:53:53,998 --> 01:53:56,751
[God] You have sacrificed nothing real.

1474
01:53:56,834 --> 01:53:59,420
[Hero] I have been pinned down
by my promises.

1475
01:54:00,504 --> 01:54:02,381
I am not the master of my life.

1476
01:54:03,758 --> 01:54:04,967
Are you okay?

1477
01:54:06,719 --> 01:54:09,012
- [Hero] I am a mouse in a maze!
- [God] A maze.

1478
01:54:09,888 --> 01:54:11,181
I feel sick.

1479
01:54:12,557 --> 01:54:13,558
I know.

1480
01:54:13,642 --> 01:54:15,644
[actors speaking indistinctly]

1481
01:54:19,189 --> 01:54:20,190
Try this.

1482
01:54:21,524 --> 01:54:22,776
It helps me.

1483
01:54:40,960 --> 01:54:43,253
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1484
01:55:20,748 --> 01:55:23,751
[pensive music playing]

1485
01:55:35,805 --> 01:55:36,805
Hello.

1486
01:55:38,724 --> 01:55:39,850
Can I help you?

1487
01:55:41,435 --> 01:55:42,811
Do you recognize me?

1488
01:55:46,606 --> 01:55:47,733
I don't know.

1489
01:55:49,401 --> 01:55:50,610
When you were little...

1490
01:55:51,820 --> 01:55:52,821
[Beau] What?

1491
01:55:54,072 --> 01:55:55,741
How did you come here?

1492
01:55:58,326 --> 01:55:59,995
I was chased.

1493
01:56:08,502 --> 01:56:10,296
Your father is alive.

1494
01:56:11,255 --> 01:56:12,089
What?

1495
01:56:12,173 --> 01:56:15,134
I knew him. After you were born.

1496
01:56:16,135 --> 01:56:18,554
I worked for your mom...

1497
01:56:18,637 --> 01:56:21,140
Not before I was born. He died before...

1498
01:56:21,223 --> 01:56:26,020
...serving your dad food,
cleaning up after him.

1499
01:56:29,106 --> 01:56:32,485
My parents were in debt to your mom.

1500
01:56:33,694 --> 01:56:34,779
What's that?

1501
01:56:36,321 --> 01:56:37,322
What?

1502
01:56:39,449 --> 01:56:42,827
- Who are you?
- It doesn't matter, I...

1503
01:56:42,911 --> 01:56:47,332
- It does. It does.
- No. It's just... Kidding. I...

1504
01:56:52,670 --> 01:56:54,464
I'm so happy to see you.

1505
01:56:59,052 --> 01:57:00,220
Are you him?

1506
01:57:00,970 --> 01:57:01,971
Wait.

1507
01:57:03,515 --> 01:57:04,723
Wait.

1508
01:57:04,807 --> 01:57:06,475
[pregnant woman] You okay, sweetheart?

1509
01:57:09,812 --> 01:57:11,605
[Hero] Do my eyes deceive me?

1510
01:57:11,688 --> 01:57:13,649
What is this phantom I see?

1511
01:57:13,732 --> 01:57:15,734
[tracker beeping]

1512
01:57:17,027 --> 01:57:18,695
Hello, fair stranger!

1513
01:57:19,363 --> 01:57:21,365
[beeping intensifies]

1514
01:57:23,242 --> 01:57:27,663
Ah, now you see, out of the shadows...

1515
01:57:27,746 --> 01:57:28,580
[grunts]

1516
01:57:30,499 --> 01:57:33,001
[actors screaming]

1517
01:57:33,085 --> 01:57:36,087
[man 1] Everybody hide now!
Get me down from here!

1518
01:57:36,170 --> 01:57:38,381
- Somebody help me!
- [man 2] Somebody!

1519
01:57:38,464 --> 01:57:40,466
[tense music playing]

1520
01:57:41,342 --> 01:57:43,970
- [woman] Oh, my God!
- [man 3] Somebody help me!

1521
01:57:44,053 --> 01:57:48,808
[man 1] Get me down from here!
Get me down! I can't, I'm tied up. Hurry!

1522
01:57:48,891 --> 01:57:50,518
Get me down! Help!

1523
01:57:50,601 --> 01:57:51,602
[Strange Man] Beau!

1524
01:57:53,062 --> 01:57:54,856
- Dad?
- Run! Now...

1525
01:57:55,982 --> 01:57:58,985
- [people screaming]
- [intense music playing]

1526
01:58:08,827 --> 01:58:10,829
[machine gun firing]

1527
01:58:14,040 --> 01:58:16,042
[Beau yelling]

1528
01:58:41,525 --> 01:58:42,985
[electricity crackling]

1529
01:59:11,804 --> 01:59:12,847
[Elaine] Am I hurting you?

1530
01:59:21,147 --> 01:59:23,066
Okay, let's go. Clothes off.

1531
01:59:25,902 --> 01:59:28,947
[Mona] Come on. Enough, now.

1532
01:59:30,405 --> 01:59:31,448
What did I say?

1533
01:59:31,531 --> 01:59:33,784
Didn't I say I wasn't gonna do this again
with you tonight?

1534
01:59:36,745 --> 01:59:39,998
I'm about to feel hurt.
You're about to really hurt me.

1535
01:59:41,875 --> 01:59:43,085
Where's Daddy?

1536
01:59:45,921 --> 01:59:46,922
Excuse me?

1537
01:59:51,468 --> 01:59:52,928
You know where Daddy is.

1538
01:59:54,137 --> 01:59:55,264
Daddy's dead.

1539
01:59:58,350 --> 01:59:59,892
Are you trying to hurt me?

1540
02:00:00,768 --> 02:00:02,561
I don't care! I want Daddy!

1541
02:00:06,691 --> 02:00:08,109
Do you want Daddy too?

1542
02:00:10,695 --> 02:00:13,406
Come on. You want it your way, let's go!

1543
02:00:25,584 --> 02:00:26,585
Up you go.

1544
02:00:27,128 --> 02:00:29,254
- I can't.
- Oh, but of course you can.

1545
02:00:29,337 --> 02:00:32,382
You're big enough to hurt Mommy,
you're big enough for this.

1546
02:00:33,717 --> 02:00:35,760
- Nobody's allowed up there.
- Up!

1547
02:00:37,971 --> 02:00:39,889
- Do you wanna go up too?
- [Young Beau] No.

1548
02:00:40,890 --> 02:00:43,601
What is that? Are you nodding?

1549
02:00:47,564 --> 02:00:48,648
This is it.

1550
02:00:50,942 --> 02:00:53,069
We don't talk about you anymore!

1551
02:00:54,612 --> 02:00:56,573
Get back in!

1552
02:01:08,542 --> 02:01:10,544
[bird singing]

1553
02:01:32,982 --> 02:01:35,985
[ominous music playing]

1554
02:02:12,187 --> 02:02:15,190
[music turns ethereal]

1555
02:02:53,144 --> 02:02:56,146

to stamp me out if I was on fire.

1896
02:31:45,022 --> 02:31:46,941
I wasn't worthy of her love.

1897
02:31:47,024 --> 02:31:49,235
I hadn't earned it. And I never earned it.

1898
02:31:49,318 --> 02:31:50,736
No matter what I did.

1899
02:31:50,820 --> 02:31:54,031
No matter how much
of my deepest, real self

1900
02:31:54,115 --> 02:31:58,828
I denied and buried and smothered
until it was dead.

1901
02:31:58,911 --> 02:32:00,121
None of it mattered.

1902
02:32:01,622 --> 02:32:04,208
She blamed me
for everything her mother did to her.

1903
02:32:06,543 --> 02:32:09,921
When I had you, I promised,
"I will never do that to him.

1904
02:32:11,714 --> 02:32:14,050
I will give him all the love I have."

1905
02:32:16,845 --> 02:32:20,223
You know what I tell people
when they ask me how my son is doing?

1906
02:32:22,183 --> 02:32:24,060
I say, "Your guess is as good as mine."

1907
02:32:29,232 --> 02:32:30,942
How I wish that were true.

1908
02:32:33,403 --> 02:32:35,904
[Friel on recording]
<i>Tell me more about that period.</i>

1909
02:32:40,450 --> 02:32:41,451
[Beau] <i>Well...</i>

1910
02:32:43,078 --> 02:32:46,081
<i>when I was just starting
to like my own stuff</i>

1911
02:32:46,165 --> 02:32:47,583
<i>and do my own things,</i>

1912
02:32:48,125 --> 02:32:50,460
<i>she'd take all those changes
very personally</i>

1913
02:32:50,544 --> 02:32:53,380
<i>and get very mad or sad,</i>

1914
02:32:53,463 --> 02:32:56,550
<i>and make me feel bad about it
until I stopped.</i>

1915
02:32:56,633 --> 02:32:59,052
[toilet flushes]

1916
02:33:00,179 --> 02:33:02,598
[Friel] <i>So, through the weaning process,</i>

1917
02:33:02,681 --> 02:33:06,434
<i>she took your displays of autonomy
as a betrayal.</i>

1918
02:33:07,518 --> 02:33:08,519
[Beau] <i>Exactly.</i>

1919
02:33:11,522 --> 02:33:12,732
<i>What do you mean?</i>

1920
02:33:14,984 --> 02:33:16,652
[Friel] <i>Can you give me an example?</i>

1921
02:33:17,361 --> 02:33:19,614
[Beau] <i>Well, like,
she would give me lots of love...</i>

1922
02:33:19,697 --> 02:33:22,033
Oh, I gave you lots of love. I'm sorry.

1923
02:33:22,116 --> 02:33:25,161
<i>...but if I didn't give it back to her
in the exact same way,</i>

1924
02:33:25,244 --> 02:33:29,707
<i>she saw it as me being not thankful
and, like, trying to hurt her.</i>

1925
02:33:30,583 --> 02:33:33,084
[Friel] <i>So, the love was conditional?</i>

1926
02:33:33,168 --> 02:33:34,169
[Beau] <i>Yes.</i>

1927
02:33:35,670 --> 02:33:37,672
[Friel] <i>This is very good for you, Beau.</i>

1928
02:33:38,548 --> 02:33:42,260
Over 300 sessions, and that was about
as flattering to me as they get.

1929
02:33:42,802 --> 02:33:44,763
Which one was my favorite, Jeremy?

1930
02:33:44,846 --> 02:33:47,724
October 3, 2018.

1931
02:33:47,807 --> 02:33:49,726
[Beau] How could you...?

1932
02:33:49,809 --> 02:33:51,353
How could you...?

1933
02:33:52,520 --> 02:33:54,606
How could you do this to me?

1934
02:33:56,816 --> 02:33:59,861
[Beau on recording]
<i>I've been having it since I was little,</i>

1935
02:34:00,737 --> 02:34:02,279
<i>where I'm a little boy,</i>

1936
02:34:02,863 --> 02:34:05,824
<i>probably the same age
as when I started having the dream,</i>

1937
02:34:06,784 --> 02:34:09,870
<i>and there's another me, who's identical...</i>

1938
02:34:10,996 --> 02:34:13,207
<i>but he's braver,</i>

1939
02:34:13,290 --> 02:34:17,378
<i>and he asks her about my father
because I'm too scared.</i>

1940
02:34:18,087 --> 02:34:18,963
<i>And then...</i>

1941
02:34:19,505 --> 02:34:22,007
<i>she sends him away and locks him up.</i>

1942
02:34:22,549 --> 02:34:23,968
<i>Upstairs.</i>

1943
02:34:24,051 --> 02:34:25,886
<i>And she never talks about him again.</i>

1944
02:34:28,055 --> 02:34:30,766
[Friel] <i>What is it you want to know
about your father?</i>

1945
02:34:30,849 --> 02:34:33,935
<i>If you weren't afraid,
if there were no consequences...</i>

1946
02:34:34,018 --> 02:34:36,312
- I want to know the truth.
<i>- ...what would you ask your mom?</i>

1947
02:34:37,605 --> 02:34:38,940
[Beau] <i>I'd ask her...</i>

1948
02:34:40,483 --> 02:34:42,068
- To tell me the truth.
<i>- I don't know.</i>

1949
02:34:42,902 --> 02:34:45,655
[Friel]
<i>Do you feel she didn't tell you the truth?</i>

1950
02:34:45,738 --> 02:34:46,781
- Yes.
- [Beau] <i>I...</i>

1951
02:34:47,490 --> 02:34:49,242
<i>- I don't know.</i>
- Yes.

1952
02:34:49,325 --> 02:34:51,661
- I know now.
<i>- But I think I'm too afraid to believe it.</i>

1953
02:34:51,744 --> 02:34:53,162
I know the truth. I...

1954
02:34:54,664 --> 02:34:55,790
I met my father.

1955
02:34:55,873 --> 02:34:58,584
I met the man in the woods, and I know.

1956
02:34:58,668 --> 02:35:00,335
Why did you lie to me?

1957
02:35:02,462 --> 02:35:04,172
Do you want the truth now?

1958
02:35:04,256 --> 02:35:05,257
Yes!

1959
02:35:14,057 --> 02:35:15,100
[Mona] Follow me.

1960
02:35:37,330 --> 02:35:39,206
- Up there?
- That's right.

1961
02:35:40,916 --> 02:35:42,043
Nobody's allowed up there.

1962
02:35:43,919 --> 02:35:45,838
Some things are for your protection, Beau,

1963
02:35:45,921 --> 02:35:48,132
and I want you to remember
that I kept this from you.

1964
02:35:52,386 --> 02:35:54,513
- I don't wanna go up there now.
- No.

1965
02:35:54,597 --> 02:35:56,682
You want the truth,
and I think you deserve it.

1966

Don't worry, sweetheart.

1967
02:36:00,143 --> 02:36:02,145
- I'll be right behind you.
- I don't want... Mom.

02:36:02,228 --> 02:36:04,230
I'll be right behind you. Don't worry.

Don't worry, sweetheart. Up you go.

Oh, sweetheart.

I didn't want you to know.

I'll be a good son. Please. I'm sorry.

- Please. I'm sorry.
- You selfish little boy!

What are you crying about?

2007
02:39:30,471 --> 02:39:32,181
Do you have any idea
what I had to go through

2008
02:39:32,265 --> 02:39:33,808
to bring you into this world?

2009
02:39:33,891 --> 02:39:35,017
Stand up.

2010
02:39:40,773 --> 02:39:41,899
You cry now?

2011
02:39:42,608 --> 02:39:44,110
You need a mother now?

2012
02:39:45,111 --> 02:39:46,988
Ever since you clawed your way out of me,

2013
02:39:47,071 --> 02:39:49,574
I've had to dig down deep
to my very bottom

2014
02:39:49,657 --> 02:39:53,410
and squeeze the love out of myself,
but still I gave it to you.

2015
02:39:54,411 --> 02:39:57,455
I've given you my whole fucking life.

2016
02:39:57,539 --> 02:39:59,124
Which you took, and you took,

2017
02:39:59,207 --> 02:40:03,211
and you took, and I squeezed myself empty.

2018
02:40:04,045 --> 02:40:05,839
I gave you everything.

2019
02:40:06,464 --> 02:40:08,967
And what do I get back? What do I have?

2020
02:40:09,593 --> 02:40:12,929
Insults. And empty promises.

2021
02:40:13,013 --> 02:40:17,058
You promised to never hurt me.
Do you even remember that one?

2022
02:40:17,142 --> 02:40:19,644
You promised it a hundred fucking times.

2023
02:40:19,728 --> 02:40:21,437
You swore on your own life.

2024
02:40:22,146 --> 02:40:24,481
But your promises are nothing but shit.

2025
02:40:26,358 --> 02:40:30,738
I've been ground down to nothing
by love and panic and worry.

2026
02:40:30,821 --> 02:40:33,365
Is my baby hungry? Is he healthy?

2027
02:40:33,449 --> 02:40:36,076
Is he scared enough of the world?

2028
02:40:37,119 --> 02:40:40,539
And the fruit of all this anguish
is grief.

2029
02:40:42,374 --> 02:40:43,459
And hatred.

2030
02:40:48,422 --> 02:40:51,090
Yes. Yes. Hatred.

2031
02:40:51,174 --> 02:40:53,176
I do. I do.

2032
02:40:54,010 --> 02:40:55,094

Can you breathe?

I'm sorry, I didn't mean to.

Born May 10th, 1975.

2048
02:45:49,503 --> 02:45:50,504
Proceed.

2049
02:45:52,214 --> 02:45:53,633
We are gathered now

2050
02:45:54,383 --> 02:45:56,260
to assess the extent...

2051
02:45:58,012 --> 02:45:59,680
of the subject's guilt.

2052
02:46:03,225 --> 02:46:08,272
To begin with,
a seemingly innocuous tradition.

2053
02:46:10,816 --> 02:46:13,443
Every Monday,
before his weekly appointment

2054
02:46:13,526 --> 02:46:15,278
to scapegoat his mother,

2055
02:46:15,362 --> 02:46:19,532
the subject would visit his local pond
to feed the ducks.

2056
02:46:19,616 --> 02:46:24,746
Just as he never missed an opportunity
to feed his therapist's fish.

2057
02:46:25,413 --> 02:46:26,539
Very nice.

2058
02:46:27,999 --> 02:46:29,000
Very nice.

2059
02:46:29,960 --> 02:46:31,419
But what happens...

2060
02:46:32,337 --> 02:46:37,133
when he meets a human beggar
that very night?

2061
02:46:40,095 --> 02:46:41,637
Now, one can see...

2062
02:46:42,471 --> 02:46:46,433
that the subject will go out of his way
to feed a bird or a fish,

2063
02:46:46,517 --> 02:46:51,772
but not to support a suffering member
of his own species.

were everywhere on the news

2065
02:46:55,651 --> 02:46:59,238
and everyone was advised
to avoid strangers!

2066
02:46:59,321 --> 02:47:01,115
This is nothing new!

2067
02:47:01,907 --> 02:47:04,827
The subject had thoughts every day

2068
02:47:04,910 --> 02:47:07,830
around relieving the suffering
of those less fortunate.

2069
02:47:07,913 --> 02:47:12,125
By all indications,
he has a healthy, functioning conscience.

2070
02:47:12,208 --> 02:47:14,585
He just chose to ignore it.

2071
02:47:15,670 --> 02:47:17,797
Consider the following episode.

2072
02:47:18,381 --> 02:47:20,341
Day 49 of his 9th year.

2073
02:47:20,425 --> 02:47:22,677
He goes shopping with his mother.

2074
02:47:23,594 --> 02:47:25,430
At one point, she lost him.

2075
02:47:26,305 --> 02:47:27,890
Or so she thought.

2076
02:47:28,891 --> 02:47:31,477
Fearing the worst, she panics.

2077
02:47:31,561 --> 02:47:33,021
She searches the building.

2078
02:47:33,104 --> 02:47:36,774
She cries out for the boy,
who was, in fact,

2079
02:47:36,858 --> 02:47:39,151
hiding behind a corner,

2080
02:47:39,234 --> 02:47:41,194
watching the whole thing.

2081
02:47:41,278 --> 02:47:43,655
[defense] My client was genuinely lost.

2082
02:47:43,739 --> 02:47:47,784
It was upon finding his mother,
seeing her frantic state,

2083
02:47:47,868 --> 02:47:50,579
that he hesitated, for fear of punishment.

2084
02:47:50,662 --> 02:47:54,833
[Cohen] It was in this frantic state
of mind that his mother tripped and fell,

2085
02:47:55,625 --> 02:47:58,962
tearing ligaments in her knee
and badly harming her ankle.

2086
02:48:00,464 --> 02:48:01,548
And still...

2087
02:48:02,382 --> 02:48:04,176
the subject did not intervene.

2088
02:48:04,259 --> 02:48:06,511
[defense] He was afraid!

2089
02:48:06,595 --> 02:48:12,058
[Cohen] Consider now the subject
at age 15, day 210,

2090
02:48:12,850 --> 02:48:16,353
finding himself in the rare company
of other boys.

2091
02:48:17,146 --> 02:48:18,355
The subject,

2092
02:48:19,023 --> 02:48:23,194
hoping to impress
his horrendous new friends,

2093
02:48:23,277 --> 02:48:25,196
invites them into his home

2094
02:48:25,279 --> 02:48:31,077
while his mother is out
buying him gifts for his birthday.

2095
02:48:31,702 --> 02:48:35,498
He lets them into her private bathroom,

2096
02:48:35,581 --> 02:48:39,292
and allows them
to rifle through her dirty laundry,

2097
02:48:39,375 --> 02:48:45,548
and inspect, and ultimately steal,
her undergarments.

2098
02:48:45,632 --> 02:48:46,925
[Beau] Oh, God.

2099
02:48:47,008 --> 02:48:49,344
Oh, God. They pressured me.

2100
02:48:49,427 --> 02:48:51,346
- They pressured me!
- [defense] They pressured him!

2101
02:48:51,429 --> 02:48:52,388
What are you doing?

2102
02:48:54,099 --> 02:48:55,600
No! No!

2103
02:48:55,683 --> 02:48:57,310
No!

2104
02:48:57,393 --> 02:48:59,104
Oh, God!

2105
02:48:59,187 --> 02:49:01,314
Oh, God! Oh, my God.

2106
02:49:01,397 --> 02:49:03,149
Oh, God.

2107
02:49:03,858 --> 02:49:09,530
Even his supposed acts of thoughtfulness
are emblematic of a greater hypocrisy.

2108
02:49:11,657 --> 02:49:13,158
Take this very week.

2109
02:49:13,242 --> 02:49:16,829
The subject asked Grace and Roger
to drive him home,

2110
02:49:16,912 --> 02:49:21,083
so that he might bury his mother
and commence proper mourning.

2111
02:49:21,166 --> 02:49:24,169
Roger offered the option...

2112
02:49:25,045 --> 02:49:26,922
of driving home tonight

2113
02:49:27,005 --> 02:49:30,884
if the offer of driving tomorrow
wasn't soon enough.

2114
02:49:30,968 --> 02:49:35,222
And Beau chose to drive home tomorrow,

2115
02:49:35,305 --> 02:49:37,014
further postponing a trip

2116
02:49:37,098 --> 02:49:40,393
that had already been
outrageously delayed.

2117
02:49:40,476 --> 02:49:43,688
And if one examines
the expression on his face

2118
02:49:43,771 --> 02:49:45,773
when Roger made this challenge...

2119
02:49:46,899 --> 02:49:48,860
one can only conclude

2120
02:49:48,943 --> 02:49:52,572
that the subject was panicked
at the idea of returning home.

2121
02:49:53,614 --> 02:49:55,324
I didn't wanna put him out.

2122
02:49:55,408 --> 02:49:58,244
I... He had surgeries.

2123
02:49:58,327 --> 02:50:01,414
[intense music playing]

2124
02:50:01,497 --> 02:50:04,834
I cried when I was beside the coffin.

2125
02:50:04,917 --> 02:50:07,127
When I was told the news,

2126
02:50:07,210 --> 02:50:10,589
I cried for hours!

2127
02:50:10,672 --> 02:50:12,674
Continuing to bear this in mind,

2128
02:50:13,842 --> 02:50:17,762
I ask you to consider yesterday.

2129
02:50:18,513 --> 02:50:22,350
Not three hours
after meeting a knocked-up dimwit

2130
02:50:22,434 --> 02:50:24,394
who made clumsy eyes at him,

2131
02:50:24,477 --> 02:50:28,148
did he gift her with a tributary gift

2132
02:50:28,231 --> 02:50:32,527
intended for no one less
than his recently deceased mother.

2133
02:50:33,612 --> 02:50:37,740
Now, when the pregnant slut offered
to return this special gift,

2134
02:50:38,490 --> 02:50:42,411
did he insist
that this total stranger keep...?

2135
02:50:49,627 --> 02:50:51,629
[trumpets sounding]

2136
02:50:59,720 --> 02:51:00,721
[yells]

2137
02:51:01,555 --> 02:51:03,265
No. No. Wait!

2138
02:51:03,348 --> 02:51:04,390
Wait! Mom!

2139
02:51:05,141 --> 02:51:06,476
Wait.

2140
02:51:06,559 --> 02:51:09,437
My legs! My legs are stuck.

2141
02:51:09,520 --> 02:51:10,855
What? Wait.

2142
02:51:12,023 --> 02:51:14,817
Wait, Mom. My legs. I can't move.

2143
02:51:21,449 --> 02:51:22,283
What?

2144
02:51:22,367 --> 02:51:25,453
Mommy, please.

2145
02:51:25,536 --> 02:51:27,455
Please help me! Please!

2146
02:51:29,123 --> 02:51:30,917
Please help me out! Please!

2147
02:51:31,000 --> 02:51:32,418
Please!

2148
02:51:32,501 --> 02:51:34,169
Please don't fault me!

2149
02:51:34,253 --> 02:51:36,922
Help! Help me!

2150
02:51:37,631 --> 02:51:39,508
Somebody help me, please!

2151
02:51:39,591 --> 02:51:41,009
Help!

2152
02:51:41,093 --> 02:51:42,344
Help!

2153
02:51:43,095 --> 02:51:44,846
Help me, please!

2154
02:51:44,930 --> 02:51:46,974
Help! Please!

2155
02:51:47,057 --> 02:51:49,351
Please. I don't want to...
I don't want to...

2156
02:51:54,398 --> 02:51:57,401
[dramatic music playing]

2157
02:53:15,601 --> 02:53:17,895
[Mona sobbing] My baby! No!

2158
02:53:19,813 --> 02:53:22,524
My baby. No.

2159
02:53:23,317 --> 02:53:25,277
My baby.

2160
02:53:35,912 --> 02:53:36,913
No.

2161
02:53:38,915 --> 02:53:42,293
My baby.

2162
02:53:44,087 --> 02:53:47,298
My baby.
