1
00:01:15,125 --> 00:01:16,542
(Children shouting)

2
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:24,958
(Birds chirruping)

3
00:02:02,125 --> 00:02:03,833
(Chairs creaking)

4
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:06,750
(Clock chiming)

5
00:02:09,708 --> 00:02:11,917
What sort of person does this?

6
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:15,667
- I think we know.
- We don't know for sure, Father.

7
00:02:16,917 --> 00:02:18,167
(Gasps)

8
00:02:18,833 --> 00:02:21,792
- How bad?
- As bad as the others.

9
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,458
But there are benefits to suffering,
don't forget.

10
00:02:26,417 --> 00:02:28,250
We worship a messiah who suffered,

11
00:02:28,375 --> 00:02:30,458
so, by my suffering,
do I not move closer to heaven?

12
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:32,083
(Father) No!

13
00:02:32,208 --> 00:02:33,667
Don't think so.

14
00:02:33,792 --> 00:02:35,417
Oh, Edith...

15
00:02:36,625 --> 00:02:40,750
Go and get the constable, please!
This'll be the death of me!

16
00:02:40,875 --> 00:02:44,708
Don't need to tell me when to go and get
the bozzler. I was going anyway.

17
00:02:44,833 --> 00:02:48,333
That woman will be off this street
as quick as a wink!

18
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:54,583
- You alright?
- I am. Are you?

19
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:57,833
(Woman next-door) Over my dead body
are you gonna be a cleaner.

20
00:02:57,958 --> 00:03:01,292
- (Crashing)
- (Woman) Fuck! The feckin' milk!

21
00:03:01,417 --> 00:03:05,250
Oh! Actuary!
Nance, I thought you could be an actuary!

22
00:03:05,375 --> 00:03:09,167
- What's an actuary?
- Well... Haven't a bloody clue.

23
00:03:09,292 --> 00:03:12,375
Rich is what it is.
Rich and clever.

24
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:15,500
And they probably give you a quill.
Now, we won't be back late, love...

25
00:03:15,625 --> 00:03:18,875
Actually, we might be back a wee bit late,
because Mammy's itching for a big one.

26
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,458
Oi! That's Bill's!
Nice girls don't play guitar.

27
00:03:22,583 --> 00:03:24,458
- I don't care.
- Right, no...

28
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,375
Do you know what I was doing
when I was your age?

29
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:28,958
Helping Grandpa steal?

30
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:32,792
Well... yes, I was helping him
burgle houses off old people.

31
00:03:33,417 --> 00:03:36,542
But I promise you now, Nancy Gooding,
you'll not be doing the same,

32
00:03:36,667 --> 00:03:40,167
because you... are a queen.

33
00:03:42,167 --> 00:03:46,167
And if you don't do your homework,
as sure as God made gooseberries,

34
00:03:46,292 --> 00:03:48,667
I'll slit you from ear to ear.

35
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,208
And not a peep out of that guitar!

36
00:03:59,292 --> 00:04:01,125
Get off that!

37
00:04:06,917 --> 00:04:08,375
Morning.

38
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:26,083
One of them, please.

39
00:04:26,208 --> 00:04:29,667
- I can take your complaint, sir.
- One of them.

40
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:33,792
Smart as ever, Mr Swan.

41
00:04:33,917 --> 00:04:37,292
Some values might survive the trenches,
Constable.

42
00:04:37,417 --> 00:04:39,875
- Another letter?
- It's wicked abuse, this!

43
00:04:41,375 --> 00:04:44,708
Edith's not sleeping.
She's grizzling all the night, bless her.

44
00:04:44,833 --> 00:04:46,333
In and out of bed.

45
00:04:46,458 --> 00:04:49,250
Now, I know my law.
This is a prison offence.

46
00:04:49,375 --> 00:04:52,583
So, you better do something about it
sharp-like,

47
00:04:52,708 --> 00:04:54,625
before there's a hurleyberloo.

48
00:05:06,792 --> 00:05:09,625
- This is all of them.
- Right.

49
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:22,000
"Dear Edith.
You foxy-ass old whore."

50
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:26,500
- Holy heavens!
- No. Carry on.

51
00:05:27,417 --> 00:05:29,667
Don't worry about me, Constable.
I rise above it.

52
00:05:31,625 --> 00:05:34,458
"You really are a tricksy old fucker.

53
00:05:34,583 --> 00:05:37,167
"You belong in hell probably,

54
00:05:37,292 --> 00:05:40,125
"and you're a sad, stinky bitch as well."

55
00:05:40,917 --> 00:05:43,042
In the end, I think it's just jealousy.

56
00:05:44,833 --> 00:05:48,375
- What are you gonna do about it?
- I'll note it. I'll surely note it.

57
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,208
- You'll what?
- Note it.

58
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:53,125
As in, write it down on some paper there,
on a form.

59
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:55,875
Which we have.
In the station yonder.

60
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
You'll write it down on a form?

61
00:05:59,042 --> 00:06:02,333
- A form?
- Yeah, alright...

62
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:07,875
Edith, do you feel certain-sure
Rose Gooding's guilty?

63
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,875
- Yes, hugely.
- Er, Edith?

64
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,625
Yes! I just said she does,
butter my wig!

65
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:16,375
It's not my place to judge anyone.
There's only one judge.

66
00:06:17,583 --> 00:06:21,833
- We all await judgement equally.
- Especially that old strumpet!

67
00:06:21,958 --> 00:06:25,875
- Well, no, that's not the point...
- Shh! Let the man speak.

68
00:06:28,583 --> 00:06:30,000
Thank you.

69
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:32,125
- Well, we at the station...
- Alright, carry on.

70
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,167
We at the station think
it's Miss Gooding, too.

71
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:41,583
But is there enough for a court summons?
She'll be away to jail for these.

72
00:06:41,708 --> 00:06:44,667
Easily enough!
She has it in for Edith.

73
00:06:44,792 --> 00:06:45,958
A misunderstanding.

74
00:06:46,083 --> 00:06:50,083
That woman curses like a fish.
She's got straggly hair all the time.

75
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:54,083
And she marches around on the Sabbath
with feet as bare as goose eggs!

76
00:06:54,208 --> 00:06:56,500
- But, even so...
- Right!

77
00:06:59,833 --> 00:07:03,583
"Her Majesty, Miss Swan,
sucks ten cocks a week minimum."

78
00:07:04,542 --> 00:07:08,583
"Edith Swan takes it up the Swanee,
and she loves it more than Christmas Day."

79
00:07:08,708 --> 00:07:10,292
- Edward!
- Only words, Mother.

80
00:07:10,417 --> 00:07:15,250
"You foxy-arse old fucking mare, you want
spiking in the nose, you big smelly bitch!"

81
00:07:15,375 --> 00:07:17,958
- (Constable) Alright...
- "You great big fucking onion!"

82
00:07:18,083 --> 00:07:19,750
Alright, man.

83
00:07:19,875 --> 00:07:24,583
Edith would need to come in and personally
make the claim in an interview with me.

84
00:07:24,708 --> 00:07:27,917
Which I know you'd struggle with, Edith,
cos of your moral misgivings in the area.

85
00:07:34,458 --> 00:07:36,625
I should not cast the first stone.

86
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:40,542
- If I were without sin...
- She'll do it!

87
00:07:41,458 --> 00:07:46,042
Edith, love, if you behave right,
as I know you will,

88
00:07:46,167 --> 00:07:48,542
you could be an example to people.

89
00:07:48,667 --> 00:07:52,542
You could be known in Littlehampton
for your virtue and your sacrifice.

90
00:07:53,125 --> 00:07:54,542
Perhaps.

91
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,792
Yes, if I could be of use to people...

92
00:07:59,542 --> 00:08:03,958
- But is it not prideful?
- It's not prideful. I hate her!

93
00:08:06,917 --> 00:08:09,917
God travels through the just.

94
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,875
Alright.

95
00:08:18,708 --> 00:08:22,833
We'll need a statement, then.
All the facts you have.

96
00:08:22,958 --> 00:08:26,375
- Where are you going now?
- To arrest Miss Gooding.

97
00:08:32,125 --> 00:08:34,292
Don't be nervous, Den.
I'll get you in the ball sack!

98
00:08:34,417 --> 00:08:36,250
(Raucous laughter)

99
00:08:36,375 --> 00:08:40,000
- Now, I have done this before!
- Have you actually?

100
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:42,542
Yes! It was different circumstances,
obviously.

101
00:08:42,667 --> 00:08:46,375
- Like how?
- Well, there wasn't a person underneath!

102
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:49,958
- Or a potato, nothing! Let's go!
- (Cheering)

103
00:08:50,083 --> 00:08:52,000
Miss Gooding?
Can you come with me, please?

104
00:08:52,125 --> 00:08:55,750
Can you give me five minutes?
I'm on the verge of making history here!

105
00:08:55,875 --> 00:08:57,083
(Whimpering)

106
00:08:57,208 --> 00:09:00,042
I don't know what you're doing, yoystering
in the pub at this hour, Miss Gooding,

107
00:09:00,167 --> 00:09:02,375
but that's a pint rather than a half.

108
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:05,833
And it's time you owned up
to these letters to Miss Swan!

109
00:09:08,542 --> 00:09:10,625
Are you fucking joking me?

110
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,375
(Cheering and laughing)

111
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:16,083
You're gonna feel like
a right daft old twat.

112
00:09:16,208 --> 00:09:17,958
- Why would I be doing that?
- So you know...

113
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:20,000
We knocked on your house
and woke up your girl,

114
00:09:20,125 --> 00:09:21,708
but Mabel Alford's in with her now.

115
00:09:21,833 --> 00:09:23,708
Nancy? Don't tell her what's happening,
Bill, please.

116
00:09:23,833 --> 00:09:26,542
- No, course I won't.
- Yeah, I had to tell her.

117
00:09:26,667 --> 00:09:28,708
- What did you say to her?
- Nothing bad.

118
00:09:28,833 --> 00:09:30,833
Just that I was arresting her mother,

119
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:34,667
and it was great shame on the family
and the street as a whole.

120
00:09:34,792 --> 00:09:35,958
Hey, Rose! Rose!

121
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:39,083
Just make sure Nancy's okay.
I'll be back in the morning.

122
00:09:39,208 --> 00:09:41,000
This is a fucking joke!

123
00:09:48,167 --> 00:09:51,833
Check her in, Gladys.
I'll, er... go tell Spedding.

124
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,500
- Name?
- Rose Gooding.

125
00:09:59,625 --> 00:10:01,458
Are you the night cleaner?

126
00:10:01,583 --> 00:10:03,750
Woman Police Officer Moss.

127
00:10:03,875 --> 00:10:06,000
- Address?
- Fuck!

128
00:10:08,542 --> 00:10:10,375
I've heard of them.

129
00:10:11,625 --> 00:10:13,875
Undercover in the sewing circle, is it?

130
00:10:18,167 --> 00:10:20,167
67, Western Road.

131
00:10:22,708 --> 00:10:24,958
- Next of kin?
- What counts as next of kin?

132
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:28,583
- Closest adult blood relative.
- I haven't got anything for that one.

133
00:10:28,708 --> 00:10:31,458
- You can put someone back home.
- (Grunts)

134
00:10:36,625 --> 00:10:39,208
You don't even get handcuffs, do you?

135
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:42,125
Actually, that is at the discretion
of my superior.

136
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:45,708
And has your superior
exercised his discretion

137
00:10:45,833 --> 00:10:48,417
hitherto in this particular circumstance?

138
00:10:49,292 --> 00:10:50,958
- Come with me.
- Fuck!

139
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:54,917
Why would I send anonymous letters to
someone I've torn strips off in the street?

140
00:10:55,042 --> 00:10:56,875
Do I look like the anonymous type to you?

141
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,500
You're not the first to say
they didn't do it.

142
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:03,333
Look, woman to woman,
I've got a daughter at home.

143
00:11:03,458 --> 00:11:04,875
Do you?

144
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:09,042
Then perhaps you should avoid
breaking the law.

145
00:11:11,167 --> 00:11:12,625
Fucker!

146
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:18,250
(Door closes)

147
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:52,792
(Muffled voices)

148
00:12:06,792 --> 00:12:09,250
- Does it always smell like this?
- Like what?

149
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:12,542
Sorry, I'm just not used to the police.

150
00:12:12,667 --> 00:12:14,250
Just tell us about Rose.

151
00:12:15,792 --> 00:12:20,167
Woman Officer Moss joins in female ones
in case of hysteria and general tears.

152
00:12:20,292 --> 00:12:21,500
So...

153
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:24,500
What's she like?

154
00:12:24,625 --> 00:12:27,333
Well, we're all God's creatures,
we're all deserving of his grace.

155
00:12:27,458 --> 00:12:29,542
- Miss Swan?
- She's heinous.

156
00:12:29,667 --> 00:12:32,042
And she's what we feared would come
after the war.

157
00:12:32,167 --> 00:12:33,708
(Sighs heavily)

158
00:12:33,833 --> 00:12:35,833
Love thy neighbour,
and I tried, but...

159
00:12:35,958 --> 00:12:37,292
(Nancy laughing)

160
00:12:37,417 --> 00:12:42,042
Well, back in the spring, when she first
moved here from the Emerald Isle,

161
00:12:42,167 --> 00:12:45,042
it was clear that
she didn't rightly fit in.

162
00:12:45,167 --> 00:12:47,292
Her husband died early in the war,
Nancy's father,

163
00:12:47,417 --> 00:12:51,250
and Bill, her latest, well, he wasn't
the same after he came back either,

164
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:55,000
and they say he wasn't the first,
she'd had a few.

165
00:12:55,125 --> 00:13:00,917
And, well, I can well imagine,
she seemed enthusiastic in that, er...

166
00:13:01,833 --> 00:13:05,125
...particular area of expertise.
(Clears throat)

167
00:13:06,333 --> 00:13:09,625
But she wanted a fresh start, she wanted
to become a respectable woman, so...

168
00:13:10,417 --> 00:13:13,292
...I think I saw myself as a missionary,

169
00:13:13,417 --> 00:13:15,958
helping someone to find a new path.

170
00:13:16,083 --> 00:13:19,583
Oh, if I could just say two words to you:
floor crumbs.

171
00:13:19,708 --> 00:13:21,667
Keep them in order,
and everything else follows.

172
00:13:21,792 --> 00:13:25,792
My Auntie had a little ditty: "A woman
whose floors are messy and foul...

173
00:13:26,875 --> 00:13:28,958
"Er... dee-dum, dee-dum, dee-dum..."

174
00:13:29,625 --> 00:13:33,167
- Anyway, the point is, she was a whore.
- Right, I'll remember that.

175
00:13:33,292 --> 00:13:36,583
Say, we should get you along
to the Christian Women's Whist Drive.

176
00:13:36,708 --> 00:13:38,375
What the fuck is that?

177
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,333
- Applejack!
- Oh, shit!

178
00:13:40,458 --> 00:13:42,375
- The language you just used out loud.
- Fuck me!

179
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,750
- Indoors, on a Wednesday.
- Jesus!

180
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:50,875
So, you got to know her, then?

181
00:13:52,083 --> 00:13:53,917
A little. Erm...

182
00:13:55,542 --> 00:13:57,542
Likable in many ways.

183
00:13:58,625 --> 00:14:00,708
'We became friends.'

184
00:14:00,833 --> 00:14:03,917
- Have you got a fella yourself?
- Ah, well...

185
00:14:04,042 --> 00:14:07,333
- No. I was engaged, but...
- Oh.

186
00:14:07,458 --> 00:14:09,958
- Christ, was he on the front?
- Oh, no, Sidney didn't die.

187
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:12,458
He just... went.

188
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:14,333
What?

189
00:14:15,208 --> 00:14:17,500
What a fucking bastard!

190
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:22,125
I bet he was pale.
Sidney's a pale, mangy, pitiful name.

191
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:24,083
Crikey.

192
00:14:25,042 --> 00:14:28,042
- A bit pallid.
- (Laughs)

193
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:31,292
My father says I'm better off,
that he was un-Christian.

194
00:14:31,417 --> 00:14:33,458
Well, I'll find you
a great big horse of a man,

195
00:14:33,583 --> 00:14:36,167
who wakes you up with a fright,
if you know what I mean!

196
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:38,042
(Laughing)

197
00:14:38,167 --> 00:14:40,667
Sure, you deserve a good 'un.
You do, Edith.

198
00:14:41,375 --> 00:14:45,458
(Edith) So, what brought you here
after your husband...?

199
00:14:46,625 --> 00:14:48,750
A fair breeze, Edie love.

200
00:14:50,792 --> 00:14:52,833
I know you're not supposed to say it,
but sometimes it's just good

201
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:55,417
to get away from your fucking family.

202
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:02,542
Of course, she, er...
ruffled a few feathers.

203
00:15:02,667 --> 00:15:06,000
I mean, not much goes unnoticed
in Western Road, as you know.

204
00:15:06,125 --> 00:15:07,542
For instance...

205
00:15:08,542 --> 00:15:11,292
- (Moaning and banging)
- (Rose) Oh, fuck!

206
00:15:11,417 --> 00:15:14,708
Oh, Jesus! Oh!

207
00:15:14,833 --> 00:15:17,583
- (Banging quickens)
- Oh! Oh!

208
00:15:18,833 --> 00:15:21,292
(Rose climaxes) Ah! Oh!

209
00:15:23,625 --> 00:15:26,250
Er... for instance, we shared
a wash house and a bath,

210
00:15:26,375 --> 00:15:30,292
and let's just say, neither were left
in the pristinest of conditions.

211
00:15:31,167 --> 00:15:32,625
- Oh, God!
- Oh Jesus!

212
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:35,375
- Aargh! Oh, God! Oh, God!
- (Screaming)

213
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:38,667
Then it was my father's birthday
at St John Methodist's.

214
00:15:39,792 --> 00:15:42,375
(Raucous laughter)

215
00:15:43,583 --> 00:15:45,875
No, no, no, I'm joking.
Only hymns.

216
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
A few dirty jokes and hymns!

217
00:15:49,333 --> 00:15:51,375
(Laughter)

218
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,708
Might have to ask the vicar first.

219
00:15:55,958 --> 00:15:58,458
Come on, Edith,
get the birthday boy some cake.

220
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:01,333
She's in the middle of a conversation.
She'll be with you when she's done.

221
00:16:01,458 --> 00:16:04,458
No. I'd like it now.

222
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:07,958
Two moments.

223
00:16:11,792 --> 00:16:14,833
- Good job her husband's not here.
- What did you say, Ray?

224
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:17,458
- Huh?
- Go on, tell us what you said.

225
00:16:17,583 --> 00:16:21,000
Oh, leave it!
It's my birthday party.

226
00:16:22,417 --> 00:16:24,500
It's your birthday party?

227
00:16:24,625 --> 00:16:27,333
Who cares?
What, are you eight years old?

228
00:16:27,458 --> 00:16:29,792
You won't speak to me
like I'm a nancy-boy.

229
00:16:29,917 --> 00:16:32,458
I was saying,
what would your fucking husband think?

230
00:16:32,583 --> 00:16:36,000
My husband isn't alive, Ray,
so he's not thinking a great deal.

231
00:16:36,833 --> 00:16:40,167
He's probably thinking it's a shame
we're missing these shitty pasties.

232
00:16:40,292 --> 00:16:42,750
Looks like he got away lightly!

233
00:16:42,875 --> 00:16:44,750
(All) Oh!

234
00:16:44,875 --> 00:16:46,333
(Gasping)

235
00:16:48,792 --> 00:16:50,458
Cake.

236
00:16:52,042 --> 00:16:54,417
Couldn't have that at Women's Whist.

237
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:57,958
I saw her the next day.

238
00:16:58,667 --> 00:16:59,875
Oh!

239
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,417
Oh... if you've come to apologise,
my father's inside.

240
00:17:03,542 --> 00:17:05,375
I haven't come to apologise.

241
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,416
Sure, why would I apologise
outside a toilet?

242
00:17:07,541 --> 00:17:10,458
- But, Rose, your behaviour last night.
- Oh, fucking Ray was a gobshite.

243
00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:12,791
And your father needs
to loosen his chain, too.

244
00:17:12,916 --> 00:17:15,125
In my opinion, that's not
how a proper lady behaves.

245
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:17,833
Oh, I'll know better than cosy up
to school ma'am next time.

246
00:17:17,958 --> 00:17:20,541
Fucking mardy old clod!
I was just trying to be your friend!

247
00:17:28,291 --> 00:17:32,292
Actually, I do really need to go!
Can you give me a second?

248
00:17:32,417 --> 00:17:35,750
- And close your ears! Oh, shit!
- (Groaning)

249
00:17:36,958 --> 00:17:39,667
And the next day,
the child protection services turned up.

250
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,667
- 'But, truly, I don't know why they came.'
- (Knocking)

251
00:17:51,292 --> 00:17:53,958
We've been alerted
to some domestic disturbances.

252
00:17:54,875 --> 00:17:57,667
Nancy, get over here.
Who told you that?

253
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:02,625
I don't think nice little girls play those,
do they, petal?

254
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:05,167
- Who says I'm fucking nice?
- Right, no. Inside now.

255
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:06,917
Gimme that. It's Bill's, anyway.

256
00:18:07,042 --> 00:18:12,625
To have your household questioned like that
in public... there's no greater shame.

257
00:18:23,417 --> 00:18:25,042
I didn't... Rose! No!

258
00:18:25,167 --> 00:18:27,333
Rose! Rose, I didn't report you!

259
00:18:27,458 --> 00:18:30,750
- And when did the letters start?
- Straight after that.

260
00:18:33,083 --> 00:18:37,000
- We haven't spoken since.
- Well, when you put it like that...

261
00:18:38,208 --> 00:18:40,042
All out of nothing.

262
00:18:41,042 --> 00:18:44,250
- What's gonna happen to her?
- (Door slams)

263
00:18:46,833 --> 00:18:48,458
Thank you, Miss Swan.

264
00:18:55,792 --> 00:18:58,917
All pointing to Rose Gooding, sir,
as suspected.

265
00:18:59,042 --> 00:19:00,458
Good job.

266
00:19:00,583 --> 00:19:03,792
Well, it's hardly surprising.
Saw it ten miles off.

267
00:19:18,708 --> 00:19:20,792
Sir?

268
00:19:21,542 --> 00:19:24,958
- You're charging her?
- Under libel. Not a small offence.

269
00:19:25,083 --> 00:19:27,458
No, it isn't.
But what's the evidence?

270
00:19:29,792 --> 00:19:31,625
Motive. Timeline.

271
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:36,917
You let me out of this fucking cell,
you aging fucking soft-cock streak of piss!

272
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:41,458
- Similarities in the language.
- Mm-hmm...

273
00:19:41,583 --> 00:19:45,542
Everyone knows it's her, love. Ever since
she got off that boat, she's a thorn.

274
00:19:45,667 --> 00:19:48,083
Rememer when she tried to climb
up the side of the pub on her birthday?

275
00:19:48,208 --> 00:19:49,542
Fell on top of Ron Flowers.

276
00:19:49,667 --> 00:19:51,708
Says he can still feel it in his neck
when he turns to the left,

277
00:19:51,833 --> 00:19:53,917
which he says he does all the time,
as do we all.

278
00:19:54,042 --> 00:19:56,292
Look, I'm doing it now.

279
00:19:56,417 --> 00:20:00,042
Yeah, no, that is... very... compelling.

280
00:20:00,167 --> 00:20:03,833
I know you're finding your feet,
and your father was a good copper,

281
00:20:03,958 --> 00:20:06,750
but there's a hierarchy
in the police, love.

282
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,458
Yes, sir.

283
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:16,000
(Gavel banging)

284
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:19,292
(Judge) Rose Gooding,
you are charged

285
00:20:19,417 --> 00:20:22,792
with writing these wicked little letters
to Edith Swan.

286
00:20:22,917 --> 00:20:24,458
You had clear motive to do this,

287
00:20:24,583 --> 00:20:27,167
and there's more than sufficient evidence
to believe that it was you.

288
00:20:27,292 --> 00:20:31,375
You allegedly harassed
a pretty, young, Christian woman,

289
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:34,167
who suffered greatly at the abuse.

290
00:20:34,292 --> 00:20:39,500
And therefore, you will be remanded
on a three-pound bail while you await trial.

291
00:20:39,625 --> 00:20:41,625
Can you afford this?

292
00:20:44,833 --> 00:20:45,875
No.

293
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:51,542
Well, then, you will away to Portsmouth
Prison for two and a half months.

294
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:53,417
- (Gavel bangs)
- (Gasps)

295
00:20:53,542 --> 00:20:55,083
Next!

296
00:20:57,583 --> 00:20:59,000
(Door opens)

297
00:21:01,625 --> 00:21:05,208
Hey, keep your chin up now, Nance.
They'll figure it out in the end, alright?

298
00:21:05,333 --> 00:21:07,917
- How can you know that for sure?
- Cos Mammy's done nothing wrong.

299
00:21:08,042 --> 00:21:09,458
Exactly.

300
00:21:09,583 --> 00:21:11,625
Just do your homework
and keep off Bill's guitar.

301
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:13,667
You got anything saved?

302
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:17,500
If I need to work, I'll work.
I don't mind.

303
00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:20,625
Yeah, I have. I've got a week's wage
due from Mrs Mills. You'll be grand.

304
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:23,417
A week? Rose, they wanna send you down.
What if you never come back?

305
00:21:23,542 --> 00:21:26,833
Are you fucking thick, man?
Just look after her.

306
00:21:28,917 --> 00:21:31,000
Do you want me to write
to your folks at home?

307
00:21:31,125 --> 00:21:34,625
- No.
- Is it a nice prison, Mammy?

308
00:21:38,083 --> 00:21:40,417
I bet it's darling.

309
00:21:40,542 --> 00:21:43,708
- You fucking wankers!
- (Camera flash blasts)

310
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:50,583
(Distant shouting)

311
00:21:54,667 --> 00:21:57,083
- Shh, shh!
- (Baby cooing)

312
00:22:02,042 --> 00:22:04,375
(Men shouting, whistles blowing)

313
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:07,500
- (Guard) Break it up! Break it up!
- (Shouting)

314
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,750
Move!

315
00:22:21,292 --> 00:22:23,125
(Men laughing)

316
00:22:28,833 --> 00:22:33,000
...it's after the game, and he's fucking her
on the floor quick as he can,

317
00:22:33,125 --> 00:22:36,500
cos her uncle's upstairs,
and he says she's a saucy bitch,

318
00:22:36,625 --> 00:22:38,292
knows all the tricks and...

319
00:22:38,417 --> 00:22:41,750
- Miss Moss?
- Carry on. Sounds like a good one.

320
00:22:42,375 --> 00:22:44,750
Well... don't think so.

321
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:48,500
It's not exactly a Sunday sermon,
not entirely.

322
00:22:48,625 --> 00:22:52,125
- How can I help?
- Firstly, I need your signature, sir.

323
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:53,375
What is it?

324
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:57,125
Lad riding a motorcycle sidecar
on the esplanade without a helmet.

325
00:22:57,250 --> 00:23:01,042
- Contrary to local byelaws.
- Are you alright? Must be shaken up.

326
00:23:01,167 --> 00:23:04,667
Yes, it's a relief to be back here with you,
Constable Papperwick.

327
00:23:04,792 --> 00:23:06,583
Oi! That's good police work.

328
00:23:06,708 --> 00:23:09,542
Secondly, having examined
the letters to Edith Swan,

329
00:23:09,667 --> 00:23:11,750
I believe we may have charged
an innocent.

330
00:23:11,875 --> 00:23:14,208
- I've been looking at the handwriting...
- You're not on that case.

331
00:23:14,333 --> 00:23:16,208
It does appear to be
a different person, sir.

332
00:23:16,333 --> 00:23:18,417
University-educated chicken swill.

333
00:23:20,875 --> 00:23:24,167
Oh, look at the curl on the 'F',
the dot on the...

334
00:23:25,583 --> 00:23:28,375
- 'I'?
- Yeah. Exactly, 'I'.

335
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:31,375
Or 'J' as well. Lower case.

336
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:34,917
- So, two options.
- Your alphabet's really coming on.

337
00:23:35,042 --> 00:23:37,542
Judges don't go for handwriting.

338
00:23:37,667 --> 00:23:40,083
Follow orders
or the whole thing falls apart.

339
00:23:40,208 --> 00:23:42,625
Yeah, women officers don't sleuth, love.

340
00:23:45,167 --> 00:23:46,417
Sir.

341
00:23:46,542 --> 00:23:48,375
Where are you off to?

342
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:52,500
To check on the emotional wellbeing
of local woman affected by crime.

343
00:23:52,625 --> 00:23:54,917
Which falls within my purview,
I believe.

344
00:24:09,542 --> 00:24:12,833
Well... hope you weren't like them.

345
00:24:33,083 --> 00:24:35,042
Woman Police Officer Moss.

346
00:24:35,167 --> 00:24:37,458
Woman Police Officer Moss.
(Sniffs)

347
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:42,042
I'm Woman Police Officer Moss.

348
00:24:45,917 --> 00:24:47,333
(Edith) The whole thing's been a trial.

349
00:24:47,458 --> 00:24:51,208
Trial is the word.
Of my strength, of my conscience.

350
00:24:51,875 --> 00:24:54,792
And the press! It's been a whirlwind.

351
00:24:55,542 --> 00:24:58,375
I don't want to be seen as a martyr,
Woman Officer Moss.

352
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:00,917
Oh, I don't think you'll be seen
as a martyr.

353
00:25:01,042 --> 00:25:03,417
They're calling me
"The Upstanding Miss Swan".

354
00:25:03,542 --> 00:25:06,583
It's a direct quote. But what do I know?
Do you want to read it?

355
00:25:06,708 --> 00:25:08,375
Oh, I'm alright.

356
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:11,750
Well, you can take a copy with you
when you go, cos we've got spares.

357
00:25:11,875 --> 00:25:14,208
Miss Gooding will have made it
to Portsmouth Prison by now.

358
00:25:14,333 --> 00:25:18,583
- Yes, the idea haunts me.
- Why? Are you having doubts it's her?

359
00:25:18,708 --> 00:25:20,417
Oh, if only. No.

360
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,875
I'm only haunted that
I didn't help her more. I liked her.

361
00:25:25,167 --> 00:25:30,125
The only saving grace is that,
owing to Rose's character and way,

362
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:33,167
in prison Rose may find
some kindred spirits.

363
00:25:33,292 --> 00:25:36,125
- In Portsmouth Prison?
- No, no, not the murderers or the rapists.

364
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:39,167
I'm thinking more the drunks
and the queers, maybe.

365
00:25:39,292 --> 00:25:41,125
Just trying to find a bright side.

366
00:25:42,583 --> 00:25:44,917
How about you, Mrs Swan?

367
00:25:45,042 --> 00:25:48,042
Who else could've done this?
What do you think?

368
00:25:48,167 --> 00:25:50,000
What do I think?

369
00:25:51,417 --> 00:25:54,125
No, nothing.
(Chuckling)

370
00:25:54,250 --> 00:25:55,958
(Door opens)

371
00:25:57,667 --> 00:26:02,125
- She's just here to check on Edith.
- (Door closes)

372
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:04,917
A woman police officer?

373
00:26:06,333 --> 00:26:08,208
Oh, look, a flying pig!

374
00:26:08,333 --> 00:26:10,167
- Ha-ha!
- (Laughing)

375
00:26:10,292 --> 00:26:14,333
He's larking around. We just find
woman police officers quite funny.

376
00:26:14,458 --> 00:26:16,917
I understand. It's an adjustment.

377
00:26:17,667 --> 00:26:21,458
- I see you did well at school, Edith.
- The world's going to hell.

378
00:26:22,583 --> 00:26:27,292
Oh, not really. You know, some prizes here,
the odd soprano solo there.

379
00:26:27,417 --> 00:26:29,292
She was a modern-day genius.

380
00:26:30,375 --> 00:26:33,292
The things she used to say at tea.
She had to be perfect.

381
00:26:33,417 --> 00:26:37,583
And that comes from being
the eldest of eleven siblings, I reckon.

382
00:26:37,708 --> 00:26:39,708
They've all gone now, but...

383
00:26:40,708 --> 00:26:43,250
There's always one chick stays behind.

384
00:26:43,375 --> 00:26:46,958
Not in nature, I don't think,
but in our family.

385
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:51,667
So, did you stay on at school
after you were twelve, then?

386
00:26:53,333 --> 00:26:58,583
- What do you make of this, hmm?
- Do you mean equal suffrage?

387
00:26:58,708 --> 00:27:03,667
Two of my boys, still in France.
What did they die for?

388
00:27:05,292 --> 00:27:06,500
Why?

389
00:27:09,708 --> 00:27:13,542
- I must get to Women's Whist.
- Oh, yes. Mind if I join?

390
00:27:13,667 --> 00:27:15,125
Oh!

391
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:16,667
Hello, girls.

392
00:27:16,792 --> 00:27:20,208
This is Gladys.
Gladys, this is Kate and Mabel.

393
00:27:20,333 --> 00:27:22,750
We played whist through the war,
it kept us all going.

394
00:27:22,875 --> 00:27:24,458
Officer.

395
00:27:24,583 --> 00:27:27,125
- Got you a lardy-john.
- Oh!

396
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:31,583
I've read everything in the papers.
Congratulations... on your tragedy.

397
00:27:31,708 --> 00:27:34,667
Thank you.
It's been a trial, it really has.

398
00:27:34,792 --> 00:27:38,250
- Have you read everything, Mabel?
- Haven't had a chance yet, love.

399
00:27:38,375 --> 00:27:40,458
I've been weeding.

400
00:27:40,583 --> 00:27:43,917
I've offered to take in her uniform.
I could take the cuffs up for you at least.

401
00:27:44,042 --> 00:27:46,000
- Thanks, Edie, I'm alright.
- Oh.

402
00:27:46,125 --> 00:27:48,125
It was her husband's.
He was a postman, too.

403
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:51,625
He drowned in the Channel, so...
Her choice.

404
00:27:52,333 --> 00:27:56,833
Mabel, it's just some newspaper stories.
Nothing really.

405
00:27:56,958 --> 00:28:02,208
Just this outpouring of sympathy for me,
it seems... and love.

406
00:28:02,333 --> 00:28:06,542
Waves and waves of love.
It's quite a humbling experience.

407
00:28:06,667 --> 00:28:10,417
I think it's just an acknowledgement
that, yes, I've been through hell,

408
00:28:10,542 --> 00:28:13,458
but I've survived
with my head held high.

409
00:28:13,583 --> 00:28:16,000
I don't know, it's not for me to say,
but I think so, yes.

410
00:28:16,125 --> 00:28:21,125
- Well, at least she's behind bars.
- Oh, hold on, dear, she's got a daughter.

411
00:28:21,250 --> 00:28:23,917
Well, we've all got daughters,
it's not...

412
00:28:24,042 --> 00:28:27,250
I mean, I don't, I've got a parakeet,
but she's a lot of work.

413
00:28:27,375 --> 00:28:31,417
We don't know it was her for sure.
Doesn't strike me as Rose, really.

414
00:28:31,542 --> 00:28:33,708
She was charged on my testimony, Mabel.

415
00:28:33,833 --> 00:28:37,292
- Don't you think it was her?
- Well... no.

416
00:28:38,083 --> 00:28:41,083
Are there other people who would do this
to Edith, do you think?

417
00:28:41,208 --> 00:28:43,292
- Any other people with grudges?
- I shouldn't think so.

418
00:28:43,417 --> 00:28:47,250
- No.
- Sorry I'm late. Andrew ran away.

419
00:28:47,375 --> 00:28:48,875
- Who's Andrew?
- A pig.

420
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,833
- Oh. Right.
- Grudges? Oh-ho, God, yeah!

421
00:28:51,958 --> 00:28:54,542
Against Edith?
I got four, just off the bat.

422
00:28:54,667 --> 00:28:59,042
- Yes, I mean Marjorie Stones!
- Oh, five, then. Hadn't thought about her.

423
00:28:59,167 --> 00:29:01,708
From the dairy?
I thought we had a good back-and-forth.

424
00:29:01,833 --> 00:29:04,375
- Oh, no, dear.
- She says you got "a gloating air".

425
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:07,208
- Oh, what a lot I'm learning.
- I wouldn't bother about it.

426
00:29:07,333 --> 00:29:10,792
- Interesting to find that out now...
- (Overlapping voices)

427
00:29:10,917 --> 00:29:13,875
Sorry, can everyone just stop
for a moment?

428
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,833
- Can everyone just stop?
- We have done.

429
00:29:17,625 --> 00:29:18,917
Right.

430
00:29:19,042 --> 00:29:23,917
Police woman, forget your name,
are you telling me it isn't Rose?

431
00:29:26,583 --> 00:29:28,625
I'm not involved in the investigation,

432
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:31,958
but we have to examine everything
before sending a woman to jail.

433
00:29:32,083 --> 00:29:33,875
Hark at you, ma'am.

434
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,292
And what next? Set her free?

435
00:29:36,417 --> 00:29:38,958
If she hasn't done it,
let her roam the land at leisure?

436
00:29:39,792 --> 00:29:42,042
Well... yes.

437
00:29:42,792 --> 00:29:46,042
- The woman's a spider on legs!
- Spiders already have legs.

438
00:29:46,167 --> 00:29:50,667
- As in a monster, is what I'm saying.
- Rose is a one, but she's not cruel.

439
00:29:50,792 --> 00:29:52,375
Really?

440
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:56,417
Calling Edith a frigid, ugly old spinster,
who still lives at home,

441
00:29:56,542 --> 00:29:58,458
with no life, is not cruel?

442
00:29:59,042 --> 00:30:01,375
I don't think the letters have said
those particular things.

443
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:03,917
- Well, where have I got them from, then?
- Your brain, I think.

444
00:30:06,167 --> 00:30:08,083
Right. Well...

445
00:30:09,083 --> 00:30:11,375
Apologies, Edith. In that case.

446
00:30:12,333 --> 00:30:17,250
We're friends with Edie, but we got
to know Rose, too, and we like her.

447
00:30:17,375 --> 00:30:19,417
- Sorry, Edith.
- No need to say sorry.

448
00:30:19,542 --> 00:30:21,625
Any kindness shown to anyone
gives me joy.

449
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:25,875
And if it isn't her, she's awaiting trial
in that wretched prison,

450
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,583
and her kin haven't even got a shilling,
let alone three pounds to bail her out.

451
00:30:31,708 --> 00:30:33,500
What on God's earth can be done?

452
00:30:53,417 --> 00:30:58,708
(Rose) 'Officer Moss, I'm not so stupid
I don't know my own reputation.

453
00:30:58,833 --> 00:31:02,917
'A tart on the run from Ireland,
is what it boils down to.

454
00:31:03,042 --> 00:31:05,333
'So your man there assumes it's me.

455
00:31:06,125 --> 00:31:10,667
'But I didn't leave Ireland for my sake.
I left for Nancy.

456
00:31:11,417 --> 00:31:16,083
'I mean, why would I risk it all
to write some letters to Edith Swan?

457
00:31:16,208 --> 00:31:18,542
'You must know it wasn't me.

458
00:31:18,667 --> 00:31:22,208
'You may not like me much,
but can't you help me?

459
00:31:22,792 --> 00:31:25,250
'Yours, Rose Gooding.'

460
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:34,125
(Moss) 'Dear Miss Gooding.
I absolutely cannot help you.

461
00:31:34,250 --> 00:31:38,000
'I'm a police officer,
and you are a suspect.

462
00:31:38,125 --> 00:31:41,875
'To do so would be to violate
the most basic codes of service.

463
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,625
'It is beyond question.

464
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:48,708
'Yours, Woman Police Officer Moss.'

465
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:01,833
- Come on, then.
- What?

466
00:32:01,958 --> 00:32:04,750
You're bailed until trial. Hurry up!

467
00:32:06,417 --> 00:32:08,875
I'm not? Am I?

468
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,583
By who?

469
00:32:11,708 --> 00:32:13,000
(Snuffling)

470
00:32:14,083 --> 00:32:16,083
(Door opens)

471
00:32:19,083 --> 00:32:22,625
What? Why the fuck
have you done that?

472
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:25,875
I didn't need your help, I was fine.
I was enjoying myself.

473
00:32:28,083 --> 00:32:30,083
How could you afford three pounds?

474
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:32,500
She sold one of her pigs.

475
00:32:33,292 --> 00:32:36,208
- Did you really?
- Well, he was quite ill, so no loss.

476
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:39,250
Well, I can't believe you've done that.

477
00:32:39,375 --> 00:32:44,500
No, honestly, don't tell anyone,
but he's dying from rot.

478
00:32:45,333 --> 00:32:47,875
- Rot?
- Pig rot.

479
00:32:48,792 --> 00:32:50,000
Jesus.

480
00:32:52,167 --> 00:32:55,167
- What are you gonna do?
- Nothing.

481
00:32:56,208 --> 00:32:58,833
I'm just gonna lie low until the trial.

482
00:33:00,375 --> 00:33:03,167
I mean, I can't see
why they think it's me.

483
00:33:03,292 --> 00:33:05,250
I was a bit roisterous once or twice.

484
00:33:05,375 --> 00:33:07,542
That won't stand up in court, though.

485
00:33:07,667 --> 00:33:10,042
I mean, people have to-dos all the time.

486
00:33:10,875 --> 00:33:13,417
Why you and not anyone else?

487
00:33:13,542 --> 00:33:17,417
- I mean, why not Sidney?
- Why Sidney?

488
00:33:17,542 --> 00:33:21,167
Oh, Edith led him along something rotten,
and then dropped him.

489
00:33:21,292 --> 00:33:24,375
What, she dropped him?
I thought it was the other way round.

490
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:26,375
Hmm... not how I remember it.

491
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:28,208
Why ain't anyone pointing
a finger at him?

492
00:33:28,333 --> 00:33:30,083
He's decent, I'm not.

493
00:33:30,208 --> 00:33:32,042
Well, nobody's perfect.

494
00:33:32,167 --> 00:33:35,167
I'm a lovely lady,
but my hygiene habits are medieval.

495
00:33:35,292 --> 00:33:38,375
They're alarming even to me.
Does that make me a criminal?

496
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:40,292
No, it doesn't.

497
00:33:40,417 --> 00:33:43,208
And decent didn't matter
when we were working in their factories,

498
00:33:43,333 --> 00:33:45,167
and driving their tractors.

499
00:33:45,292 --> 00:33:48,292
Oh, we have to go back
to being decent, do we?

500
00:33:48,417 --> 00:33:50,958
Well... fuck 'em!

501
00:33:51,583 --> 00:33:53,917
I've got some rum.
Fuck 'em up the arse!

502

I'm getting better! I'm sorry.

Don't let them fuck you up, hmm?

You shaved specially for me, admit it.

Ow! Fuck, are you trying

519
00:35:45,833 --> 00:35:49,375
- How's Nance really been?
- She's been fine.

520
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:51,333
She loves you, you know.

521
00:35:51,458 --> 00:35:53,833
I know. You both do.

522
00:35:54,583 --> 00:35:56,625
(Knocking at door)

523
00:36:03,083 --> 00:36:05,083
- Hello, there. Daily Mail.
- No!

524
00:36:05,208 --> 00:36:08,208
No, no, no... I'm not going to grill you
about the letters.

525
00:36:08,333 --> 00:36:09,750
What, then?

526
00:36:10,708 --> 00:36:13,167
No, that is what I'm going to do.

527
00:36:13,292 --> 00:36:15,458
Why do they even care?

528
00:36:15,583 --> 00:36:17,625
Cos people like to pick a side.

529
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:20,750
- And them letters are filth.
- They're fucking funny.

530
00:36:22,333 --> 00:36:24,208
"Peculiar case of...

Give me fucking strength!

534
00:36:43,958 --> 00:36:46,333
These houses are going to the dogs.

535
00:36:46,458 --> 00:36:49,500
- Sorry, Father, I was onto that next.
- (Chuckling)

536
00:36:49,625 --> 00:36:51,792
Dazzled by the limelight, are you?

537
00:36:52,667 --> 00:36:55,917
Head turned
by Madame and Monsieur Fame?

(Chuckling)

539
00:36:57,417 --> 00:37:00,583
- Don't you get carried away.
- Oh, no, Father, I've sat down two seconds.

540
00:37:00,708 --> 00:37:03,083
- Remember your place.
- Course.

541
00:37:10,833 --> 00:37:12,708
Yes, Father.

542
00:37:19,583 --> 00:37:21,083
(Door slams)

543
00:37:37,958 --> 00:37:39,625
Rose?

544
00:37:44,125 --> 00:37:45,792
What timing.

545
00:37:45,917 --> 00:37:49,458
I've thought and prayed about what
I'd say to you the first time I saw you.

546
00:37:51,458 --> 00:37:55,625
Oh, well... no hard feelings.
It was good to get away.

547
00:37:58,042 --> 00:38:02,375
- I forgive you, Rose.
- Edith... I didn't do it.

548
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:07,542
Who's that?

549
00:38:07,667 --> 00:38:10,250
Er... that's me. I'm sorry.

550
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,792
I thought this was
more of a private situation.

551
00:38:13,917 --> 00:38:17,417
But also, I... didn't want to leave
in case of problems,

552
00:38:17,542 --> 00:38:19,625
so I held position.

553
00:38:20,458 --> 00:38:23,958
The Father and I have been discussing
a sermon I might give at St Catherine's.

554
00:38:24,083 --> 00:38:27,375
We're all positively fizzing with the idea.

555
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:29,792
And I had a passage
I wanted to read to you, too.

556
00:38:29,917 --> 00:38:32,833
- That's what I mean by "good timing".
- Twist of fate.

557
00:38:32,958 --> 00:38:35,792
- No, thank you.
- No... thank you?

558
00:38:36,833 --> 00:38:39,875
- It's very short, quite energising.
- You don't want me any more energised.

559
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,875
- Not unless you want a good bannicking.
- A physical threat?

560
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,792
It's like a trapdoor to hell opens up
everywhere you tread.

561
00:38:46,917 --> 00:38:50,750
- I'm not actually evil, you know?
- No, but you've got evil in you.

562
00:38:50,875 --> 00:38:52,875
No, no, it's not your fault,
but you were born with it...

563
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:57,542
I like you, Rose, and I'd like to bring you
to the light. For Nancy's sake.

564
00:39:01,042 --> 00:39:03,208
You can keep your fucking light.

565
00:39:05,083 --> 00:39:06,500
(Gasps)

566
00:39:12,417 --> 00:39:14,958
What are you doing?
What's all this for?

567
00:39:15,083 --> 00:39:17,625
Nothing.
I'm just making the house nice.

568
00:39:18,250 --> 00:39:21,625
- Like nice mothers do.
- Well, you're already a nice mother.

569
00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:25,250
I just want it all to be
a bit better for Nancy.

570
00:39:25,375 --> 00:39:29,333
It's too late for me, but I just wanted it
to be a bit... better, you know...

571
00:39:29,458 --> 00:39:30,875
- Fuck!
- Hey, hey.

572
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,583
I'm fine!

573
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:39,292
If I just prove to people that I don't have
a demon residing inside my fucking abdomen,

574
00:39:39,417 --> 00:39:41,625
- then maybe I wouldn't...
(Banging)

575
00:39:47,292 --> 00:39:50,208
Explain this what just came
with the postman!

576
00:39:50,333 --> 00:39:54,417
- Explain it! Soon as you're back!
- I didn't! I promise I...

577
00:39:54,542 --> 00:39:56,875
- This'll be the death of me!
- "Dear Miss Swan.

578
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,708
"You bloody fucking old saggy sack
of chicken piss.

579
00:39:59,833 --> 00:40:03,875
"You want fucking in the nose holes,
you old beetle!"

580
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,583
Beetle?

581
00:40:05,708 --> 00:40:07,708
Edith, you honestly don't think
I've been doing this.

582
00:40:07,833 --> 00:40:09,292
I don't know anymore.

583
00:40:09,417 --> 00:40:11,292
Father, it mightn't be her.
It could be all kinds of people.

584
00:40:11,417 --> 00:40:15,333
- She was my friend.
- No! She wasn't your friend.

585
00:40:15,458 --> 00:40:18,875
- She's a lying slut!
- Hey, what did you just say?

586
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,583
You know she is.
Be a man, son!

587
00:40:21,708 --> 00:40:24,083
Don't front up to me, old boy.
I used to box in bars for cash!

588
00:40:24,208 --> 00:40:26,000
Don't tell people that, obviously.

589
00:40:26,125 --> 00:40:27,750
- And you stink out the wash house, too.
- Bill!

590
00:40:27,875 --> 00:40:29,750
Well, he does. I think you're ill, mate.

591
00:40:31,958 --> 00:40:33,833
- (Screaming)
- My God, please!

592
00:40:34,458 --> 00:40:36,583
Bill! Get inside! Get inside!

593
00:40:36,708 --> 00:40:38,208
Get inside!

594
00:40:38,333 --> 00:40:41,875
- No, I just want this to stop!
- Oi, oi, oi! Where is she?

595
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,333
Lizzie, what's the matter?

596
00:40:43,458 --> 00:40:46,083
I've just had this,
saying I'm a middling hooker,

597
00:40:46,208 --> 00:40:49,167
and my fella's having it off
with a tall governess!

598
00:40:49,292 --> 00:40:51,333
Sending them to everyone now, are you?

599
00:40:51,458 --> 00:40:55,375
What? No... Are you a fucking eejit?
Why would I...?

600
00:40:59,917 --> 00:41:03,542
- More letters. Lizzie Bailey's just...
- We know. She's been fined a ha'penny.

601
00:41:03,667 --> 00:41:05,917
Ha'penny? She could've killed her
with that shovel!

602
00:41:06,917 --> 00:41:10,583
- How many have you got? Shut them blinds.
- Six just this morning on my rounds.

603
00:41:10,708 --> 00:41:13,333
- All to people connected with Gooding?
- Yep.

604
00:41:13,458 --> 00:41:15,333
- There or thereabout.
- I've filed four.

605
00:41:15,458 --> 00:41:19,583
Two of mine alluded in a roundabout way
to sodomy, beg pardon there, Gladys.

606
00:41:19,708 --> 00:41:21,958
One of them used a word
I've never even seen before.

607
00:41:22,083 --> 00:41:24,125
Yeah. I actually think
it's Greek in origin.

608
00:41:24,250 --> 00:41:27,375
- Really? How do you know that?
- Fascinating how language travels.

609
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:30,542
- It's horrific.
- So, that is eleven...

610
00:41:31,583 --> 00:41:33,792
Doesn't it seem a bit queer to you
Rose would do that,

611
00:41:33,917 --> 00:41:35,542
knowing she'd lose everything?

612
00:41:35,667 --> 00:41:37,583
Gone soft for her. Christ!

613
00:41:37,708 --> 00:41:40,125
She's just this moment out,
and here they all are.

614
00:41:40,250 --> 00:41:42,000
She boozes, then she curses.

615
00:41:42,125 --> 00:41:43,333
- So do you.
- Huh?

616
00:41:43,458 --> 00:41:45,458
- Why's worse when she does it?
- Well...

617
00:41:47,625 --> 00:41:50,208
- Yeah, go on, say it again...
- It's obvious she didn't do it.

618
00:41:50,333 --> 00:41:52,708
Can you at least admit
there's a chance she didn't do it?

619
00:41:52,833 --> 00:41:56,542
Definitely not. Christ, Glad,
that Gooding wench is done!

620
00:41:56,667 --> 00:41:59,333
I've had one now,
calling my wife's voice too deep,

621
00:41:59,458 --> 00:42:01,375
which she already knows,
thank you.

622
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:03,500
And it aches when she tries
to pitch-up anyway.

623
00:42:04,625 --> 00:42:07,500
Gladys, can you get some tea on, please?

624
00:42:08,917 --> 00:42:10,333
Gladys?

625
00:42:13,792 --> 00:42:15,792
Milk and two sugars.

- You tepid fucking cow...

Ow! Fuck me! Don't break it now,
that's my letter-writing arm!

I want this on your fucking conscience.
I asked you for help!

647

I'm an officer.
Why would I help a suspect?

648
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:53,250
Because the police are horseshit!

649
00:43:53,375 --> 00:43:56,708
If you want help, Rose, there are better ways
to go about it than cursing and fighting.

650
00:43:56,833 --> 00:43:59,917
I don't need your fucking help.
I don't trust your fucking help!

I would like to interview you, though,
one more time.

655
00:44:13,208 --> 00:44:15,167
In the spirit of rigour.

656
00:44:15,292 --> 00:44:17,667
Rigour? Ha-ha!

657
00:44:19,958 --> 00:44:22,667
If you'd like to step inside...

658
00:44:33,875 --> 00:44:37,792
"While many of her gender
take to the streets in protest,

659
00:44:37,917 --> 00:44:42,000
"Miss Swan might teach them
something of moral rectitude.

660
00:44:42,125 --> 00:44:47,375
"The childless spinster is grim-looking
and by no means conventionally charming."

661
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:50,875
- Oh...
- Well, that's not true.

662
00:44:52,833 --> 00:44:57,083
"Miss Swan refuses
to condemn her neighbour.

663
00:44:57,208 --> 00:45:00,917
"'It is in the pardoning
that we are pardoned,' she says.

664
00:45:01,042 --> 00:45:05,375
"She will give a sermon herself
at St Catherine's in the coming weeks."

665
00:45:06,167 --> 00:45:09,417
Ooh, you are a treasure.
Now, you must be pleased with that.

666
00:45:09,542 --> 00:45:12,542
Pride changes angels into devils.

667
00:45:12,667 --> 00:45:15,417
Do you know what men will do
with this picture, hmm?

668
00:45:17,750 --> 00:45:19,917
Pin it on the privy door, is what.

669
00:45:21,125 --> 00:45:24,208
- It's disgusting.
- Father, it's nothing, it's...

670
00:45:27,083 --> 00:45:30,458
It's... just a small interview.
It doesn't warrant...

671
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,583
I'm sorry.

672
00:45:34,750 --> 00:45:36,167
I'm a...

673
00:45:37,375 --> 00:45:41,542
- Am I being silly?
- Somewhat, Father.

674
00:45:41,667 --> 00:45:43,958
A daft egg, am I?

675
00:45:44,083 --> 00:45:45,625
(Laughs)

676
00:45:46,750 --> 00:45:48,875
- (Glass smashing)
- Edward!

677
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,583
No, you're right. I'll lower my voice.

678
00:45:51,708 --> 00:45:54,542
Goodness knows
what the neighbours might think!

679
00:45:56,083 --> 00:45:58,417
I won't be made a nancy-boy!

680
00:45:59,625 --> 00:46:02,667
You might be trotting up the fucking pulpit,
but whose household is this?

681
00:46:02,792 --> 00:46:04,375
- It's yours.
- Who's the captain of this ship?

682
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:06,042
- You.
- And what are you?

683
00:46:06,167 --> 00:46:07,333
- I don't know.
- What are you?

684
00:46:07,458 --> 00:46:08,583
Father...

685
00:46:10,250 --> 00:46:13,458
- You're my little Edie.
- (Gasping)

686
00:46:13,583 --> 00:46:16,500
And you always will be.

687
00:46:21,125 --> 00:46:25,042
Proverbs, chapter three,
verses 11 and 12.

688
00:46:26,708 --> 00:46:28,458
Two hundred times.

689
00:46:29,833 --> 00:46:32,083
Do I have to count to three?

690
00:46:41,667 --> 00:46:43,667
Apologies for the language.

691
00:46:47,375 --> 00:46:49,542
I don't like the way you speak
or the way you act.

692
00:46:49,667 --> 00:46:52,042
Rose, I should be clear,
this isn't about being friends.

693
00:46:52,167 --> 00:46:56,333
Uh, good God, no, Gladys.
You got your career to think about.

694
00:46:56,458 --> 00:46:58,417
Woman Police Officer Moss, please.

695
00:46:58,542 --> 00:47:01,000
I'm not saying all that.
I will say Officer Moss.

696
00:47:01,125 --> 00:47:05,250
- Woman Police Officer Moss!
- I can see you're a woman. Jesus!

697
00:47:13,167 --> 00:47:15,958
I don't think you wrote these letters,
Miss Gooding.

698
00:47:16,083 --> 00:47:20,250
Cos look.
This is a formal, educated hand.

699
00:47:20,375 --> 00:47:22,500
Whereas yours is... I mean...

700
00:47:23,292 --> 00:47:26,708
- Did you go to school?
- Yes, thank you!

701
00:47:27,458 --> 00:47:29,875
- Because you capitalise your 'Fs'.
- Yeah, it looks better.

702
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,333
Is there some rule book that says
which letters you capitalise

703
00:47:32,458 --> 00:47:34,375
and which ones you don't,
and when?

704
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:36,417
Yes, there is.

705
00:47:37,208 --> 00:47:41,500
The writing in the letters is quite florid.
The 'S', the 'F', the 'G'...

706
00:47:41,625 --> 00:47:44,250
(Rose) Who's got time to write
fucking 'Gs' like that?

707
00:47:44,375 --> 00:47:46,750
Up to them, I suppose.

708
00:47:47,708 --> 00:47:50,833
The scope of the crime has widened
since we last spoke.

709
00:47:50,958 --> 00:47:54,333
Now, the sentence could easily be
a year's hard labour, by my reckoning.

710
00:47:54,458 --> 00:47:57,667
During which you would presumably
lose custody of your child.

711
00:47:59,417 --> 00:48:03,208
There are ten days until the trial,
so let's get down to it.

712
00:48:05,042 --> 00:48:06,708
Thank you for this.

713
00:48:13,583 --> 00:48:15,625
Have you got a fella?

714
00:48:16,333 --> 00:48:19,625
Lady police are forbidden marrying
or having children.

715
00:48:20,667 --> 00:48:23,500
Fucking Jesus shat on the cross!

716
00:48:23,625 --> 00:48:25,333
Then, why?

717
00:48:25,458 --> 00:48:28,667
My dad did it.
Twenty-two years.

718
00:48:32,875 --> 00:48:35,083
I think you've been set up, Rose.

719
00:48:35,875 --> 00:48:38,875
Is there anyone who'd want to do
such a thing?

720
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:42,000
Have you got a pen and paper?

721
00:48:42,125 --> 00:48:46,333
(Edith) "My son, despise not..."

722
00:48:47,375 --> 00:48:51,625
"...the chastening of the Lord.

723
00:48:51,750 --> 00:48:57,458
"Neither be weary of his correction.

724
00:48:57,583 --> 00:49:01,000
"Even as a father...

725
00:49:02,375 --> 00:49:08,083
"...the son in whom he delighteth.

726
00:49:13,417 --> 00:49:16,042
"My... son...

727
00:49:21,917 --> 00:49:23,292
"...despise...

728
00:49:23,417 --> 00:49:27,458
"Neither be weary of..."

729
00:49:31,250 --> 00:49:37,250
"For whom the Lord... loveth."

730
00:49:37,375 --> 00:49:38,958
(Exhales)

731
00:49:58,958 --> 00:50:00,708
(Floorboard creaking)

732
00:51:07,833 --> 00:51:10,333
(Footsteps)

733
00:51:29,042 --> 00:51:30,542
"Dear...

734
00:51:32,583 --> 00:51:34,042
"...Edith.

735
00:51:41,667 --> 00:51:43,583
"You big...

736
00:51:44,958 --> 00:51:46,375
"...fucking...

737
00:51:48,125 --> 00:51:49,792
"...arsehole."

738
00:52:39,958 --> 00:52:41,958
(Groaning)

739
00:52:44,333 --> 00:52:45,792
(Groaning)

740
00:52:46,833 --> 00:52:48,583
- (Father) Oh...
- (Mother) Edith!

741
00:52:48,708 --> 00:52:51,042
Edith... Edith!

742
00:52:51,167 --> 00:52:53,417
- Oh, oh...
- (Groaning)

743
00:52:54,375 --> 00:52:59,250
- (Mother) Edith!
- Oh! What's happened? Oh!

744
00:53:00,125 --> 00:53:02,792
- Mother...
- Go and get a doctor.

745
00:53:06,417 --> 00:53:08,042
Alright, love?

746
00:53:15,208 --> 00:53:17,542
Go and get a doctor, quick!

747
00:53:17,667 --> 00:53:19,083
Quick!

748
00:53:52,583 --> 00:53:54,417
Are you alright there, Edith?

749
00:53:56,292 --> 00:53:59,333
Oh, yes, yes.
What do I do again?

750
00:53:59,917 --> 00:54:02,375
It's just a small amount of paperwork.

751
00:54:02,500 --> 00:54:06,792
Someone will have to formally confirm
that it's her. I have to witness.

752
00:54:08,417 --> 00:54:10,667
Right. My father's upstairs, so...

753
00:54:30,375 --> 00:54:33,333
Righty-ho.
Let's, er... please.

754
00:54:36,583 --> 00:54:38,167
It's just your name.

755
00:54:46,250 --> 00:54:48,375
And then the signature.

756
00:54:49,292 --> 00:54:52,375
She was so good.
She was good.

757
00:54:53,542 --> 00:54:57,458
So sorry. Sorry.
I seem quite overcome.

758
00:54:57,583 --> 00:54:59,917
We'll find who wrote these letters,
Miss Swan.

759
00:55:00,583 --> 00:55:02,750
What do you mean?
I thought the police knew it was Rose.

760
00:55:02,875 --> 00:55:05,750
That does appear to be the case, yes.

761
00:55:28,292 --> 00:55:31,208
(Vicar) On behalf of the Swan family,

762
00:55:31,333 --> 00:55:34,625
I would like to pay tribute
to Victoria Swan.

763
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:37,792
In a time when our morality
is threatened,

764
00:55:37,917 --> 00:55:41,000
and women everywhere
are losing their decorum,

765
00:55:41,125 --> 00:55:43,708
she was a woman who knew her role.

766
00:55:44,708 --> 00:55:48,208
These recent crimes
must not cause despair.

767
00:55:48,333 --> 00:55:50,917
Rather we must remember
that in God's eyes,

768
00:55:51,042 --> 00:55:56,958
the guilty inform on themselves
with their own souls,

769
00:55:57,083 --> 00:56:00,667
and the pure of heart...
are set free.

770
00:56:01,583 --> 00:56:03,208
Amen.

771
00:56:04,958 --> 00:56:07,833
(Vicar) Let us pray
for Edward and Edith,

772
00:56:07,958 --> 00:56:10,792
and all that Victoria leaves behind her.

773
00:56:16,708 --> 00:56:20,917
- You're a bright button, aren't you?
- I just want to be a part of it, sir.

774
00:56:22,542 --> 00:56:25,083
- I don't want anything special.
- Sir?

775
00:56:27,625 --> 00:56:29,375
- Something major.
- Wait.

776
00:56:29,500 --> 00:56:32,542
Everyone wants a part of it,
we got hacks from France,

777
00:56:32,667 --> 00:56:36,000
a private investigator from Sweden,
all got theories.

778
00:56:36,708 --> 00:56:41,542
Problem is, you've been asking
questions behind my back, ain't you?

779
00:56:41,667 --> 00:56:45,167
- Well, not really.
- You don't have to lie. People talk.

780
00:56:45,292 --> 00:56:47,542
You got a policeman's nose.

781
00:56:48,250 --> 00:56:50,458
Maybe I asked
the odd innocent question, sir.

782
00:56:50,583 --> 00:56:52,833
- Sir, could I quickly...?
- Not now.

783
00:56:55,292 --> 00:56:58,208
Problem is, I asked you not to.

784
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,542
Do you think you're the first person
to suspect Edith?

785
00:57:01,667 --> 00:57:05,375
I told you,
handwriting won't cut it in trial.

786
00:57:05,500 --> 00:57:08,000
Especially coming from you.

787
00:57:08,125 --> 00:57:10,417
- I'm a police officer...
- Woman Police Officer.

788
00:57:10,542 --> 00:57:13,000
Don't have to say that every time,
people can see I'm a woman.

789
00:57:13,125 --> 00:57:15,458
Home Secretary's in Parliament,
saying we need to catch the letter-writer,

790
00:57:15,583 --> 00:57:17,875
so I fucking will, my God!

791
00:57:18,875 --> 00:57:21,708
You'd need to catch her red-handed.
And how are you gonna do that?

792
00:57:25,792 --> 00:57:27,417
Yes?

793
00:57:27,542 --> 00:57:29,875
We got a psychic.
From Toronto, Canada.

794
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,917
- Yes?
- Says he's got an amethyst.

795
00:57:32,042 --> 00:57:35,083
- Sounds like a pretty powerful one.
- Get out of my office.

796
00:57:35,208 --> 00:57:36,708
Will do.

797
00:57:40,792 --> 00:57:43,167
You know I have to suspend you.

798
00:57:45,917 --> 00:57:47,750
You know that.

799
00:57:47,875 --> 00:57:50,667
Please, sir, I, er...
I think...

800
00:57:52,125 --> 00:57:53,542
Please, sir.

801
00:57:53,667 --> 00:57:55,958
You know what was good
about your father?

802
00:57:56,083 --> 00:57:59,375
He knew the hierarchy,
and he did what he was told.

803
00:57:59,500 --> 00:58:01,833
(Opens drawer)

804
00:58:02,792 --> 00:58:05,125
Look at these. Handcuffs.

805
00:58:06,125 --> 00:58:08,500
They could be yours.

806
00:58:08,625 --> 00:58:13,292
But if you meddle in my case again,
they'll be on your fucking wrists.

807
00:59:19,458 --> 00:59:21,292
(Opens bin)

808
00:59:57,333 --> 00:59:59,042
(Door opens)

809
01:00:02,208 --> 01:00:03,917
What are you doing?

810
01:00:04,625 --> 01:00:06,083
Nothing.

811
01:00:19,208 --> 01:00:24,292
"Dear Mrs Pagwell.
You arse sucker.

812
01:00:24,417 --> 01:00:27,375
"Call that a chin?
There's nothing fucking there."

813
01:00:28,292 --> 01:00:32,125
That wily higgler.
I don't believe it.

814
01:00:32,250 --> 01:00:34,125
I think it's a kind of mania.

815
01:00:34,250 --> 01:00:37,292
Well, Rose will kill her.
She's got the red mist.

816
01:00:37,417 --> 01:00:41,375
She won't, because we won't tell her.
Not till we've proved it.

817
01:00:41,500 --> 01:00:45,292
- We have a week.
- Police know you're doing this?

818
01:00:45,417 --> 01:00:48,250
I'm not currently working
at the police, no.

819
01:00:48,375 --> 01:00:50,083
Oh!

820
01:00:50,208 --> 01:00:52,417
You're got some plums.

821
01:00:52,542 --> 01:00:54,875
Keep this between us.

822
01:00:55,833 --> 01:01:00,375
Why me? I don't like secrets.
They actually give me a churny tum.

823
01:01:00,500 --> 01:01:03,417
Cos your shed overlooks
their house, doesn't it?

824
01:01:03,542 --> 01:01:05,208
Oh...

825
01:01:05,333 --> 01:01:08,625
- I'm gonna need some bran.
- (Breaks wind)

826
01:01:10,167 --> 01:01:12,750
I'll take that as a yes.

827
01:01:25,250 --> 01:01:27,583
Sorry for your troubles.

828
01:01:28,833 --> 01:01:31,583
I mean it.
She was a good lady, your mother.

829
01:01:32,542 --> 01:01:34,708
How have you been getting on?

830
01:01:34,833 --> 01:01:37,333
Oh, I've been feeling grand,
thank you.

831
01:01:38,250 --> 01:01:41,792
- How about you?
- I'm a wee bit preoccupied.

832
01:01:42,583 --> 01:01:45,167
Yes. I see they trumpet me
in Parliament.

833
01:01:45,292 --> 01:01:47,375
Well, there's a range of opinions.

834
01:01:48,333 --> 01:01:52,167
- Where did you learn to read?
- A local priest taught me.

835
01:01:53,542 --> 01:01:56,792
At least he said he was a priest.
Asked me to elope to Morocco in the end.

836
01:01:57,875 --> 01:02:01,625
He was a fine tutor of letters.
How about yourself?

837
01:02:02,583 --> 01:02:06,625
I used to help my father
with the signwriting from a very early age.

838
01:02:06,750 --> 01:02:09,500
I did all the ones for Glimson's Dairy
when I was only eight.

839
01:02:09,625 --> 01:02:11,208
(Rose laughs)

840
01:02:14,417 --> 01:02:17,958
Oh, would you return my patty pans
before the trial next week?

841
01:02:19,833 --> 01:02:23,458
Just in case I don't see you
for a long while afterwards. Ta.

842
01:02:26,167 --> 01:02:28,083
"Ta."

843
01:02:28,917 --> 01:02:30,917
Fucking mardy old bitch!

844
01:02:31,042 --> 01:02:32,708
(Gladys) What is the nature
of their conversation?

845
01:02:32,833 --> 01:02:35,250
- (Ann) Nature of the conversation is...
- (Gladys) Angry?

846
01:02:35,375 --> 01:02:36,875
- (Ann) Hostile.
- Where is Edith now?

847
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,833
- Edith's heading up the road.
- Heading up the road in which direction?

848
01:02:39,958 --> 01:02:42,833
- North-by-northwest.
- North-by-northwest.

849
01:02:43,417 --> 01:02:48,250
(Ann) She has disappeared
around the corner at 9:26 and a half.

850
01:02:48,375 --> 01:02:50,042
This way round...

851
01:02:50,167 --> 01:02:53,667
- Oh, alright.
- Mr Francis Hill.

852
01:02:53,792 --> 01:02:57,042
- 52, Sussex Terrace. That is...
- Mark there.

853
01:03:06,167 --> 01:03:09,417
- 62, Windsor Street...
- That's all the way here.

854
01:03:09,542 --> 01:03:12,917
- That's out of town, really, innit?
- Did she go all the way to 62, Windsor St.

855
01:03:13,542 --> 01:03:16,583
(Gladys) Put that chicken down.
Come on, then, let's get an early start.

856
01:03:16,708 --> 01:03:19,875
(Ann) Now, my girls, you be good.

857
01:03:31,292 --> 01:03:35,958
"Dear Gladys. Thank God
your dad got shot. You smelly bitch.

858
01:03:36,083 --> 01:03:39,125
"You think you're so clever,
but you're fucking not."

859
01:03:42,917 --> 01:03:44,500
Right, back to work.

860
01:03:44,625 --> 01:03:48,250
(Edith) '"You rank, foxy-arse measle.
You'll soon find yourselves in the dock.'

861
01:03:48,375 --> 01:03:51,000
"The lot of you bloody fucking buggers."

862
01:03:51,125 --> 01:03:55,208
- Linden Drive as well.
- Oh, what, two in Linden Drive? No?

863
01:03:55,333 --> 01:03:57,875
"You foxy-arse, beetle-headed slut."

864
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:02,792
"You piss country whore."

865
01:04:02,917 --> 01:04:07,000
'"To the old bastard Mitchells.
You elf-skinned country whores.'

866
01:04:07,125 --> 01:04:10,250
"You belong in a cave."
"You foxy-arse rabbit-fuckers."

867
01:04:10,375 --> 01:04:15,708
"You mouldy old tart."
"You belong in hell."

868
01:04:15,833 --> 01:04:19,750
- Do we get the timings on how she goes...
- I've got all the timings.

869
01:04:19,875 --> 01:04:22,750
"You dirty fucking sods."
Hmm...

870
01:04:40,333 --> 01:04:42,208
9:04.

871
01:04:47,750 --> 01:04:49,292
Wait...

872
01:04:51,083 --> 01:04:53,542
(Gladys gasps) We've got her!

873
01:04:55,417 --> 01:04:56,875
Let's get the postie.

874
01:04:57,708 --> 01:05:00,042
No. To her aunty in Worthing.

875
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:05,333
Saying she's very sorry she's ill.
Also correcting her spelling of "diabetes".

876
01:05:05,458 --> 01:05:07,125
Thank you.

877
01:05:27,042 --> 01:05:29,458
Oh! That's rude.

878
01:05:32,542 --> 01:05:34,083
We're out of time.

879
01:05:34,875 --> 01:05:38,167
'Trial's tomorrow.
Rose is gonna go down.'

880
01:05:38,292 --> 01:05:40,375
Aye, we'll have one of them, please.

881
01:05:40,917 --> 01:05:42,208
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

882
01:05:42,333 --> 01:05:43,750
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

883
01:05:43,875 --> 01:05:46,292
- Is it nice?
- Mm-hmm.

884
01:06:13,417 --> 01:06:15,250
(Overlapping conversations)

885
01:06:23,167 --> 01:06:24,833
Please don't do anything, Rose.

886
01:06:24,958 --> 01:06:29,417
If the game's voided, we share the points,
and my winning streak's in tatters.

887
01:06:31,583 --> 01:06:33,167
I'm civil.

888
01:06:34,875 --> 01:06:37,500
Just never got my invite
to the whist, did I?

889
01:06:39,458 --> 01:06:41,500
I don't even know who the fuck she is.

890
01:06:42,208 --> 01:06:43,625
Dorothea.

891
01:06:45,083 --> 01:06:47,333
Would you like a game, then?

892
01:06:51,083 --> 01:06:53,125
Your hands, ladies.

893
01:06:56,625 --> 01:06:58,542
What was it?

894
01:07:00,167 --> 01:07:01,750
Edith.

895
01:07:02,917 --> 01:07:04,125
Why?

896
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:08,125
Rose, you've turned up to Christian
Women's Whist without invitation,

897
01:07:08,250 --> 01:07:12,250
carrying liquor, and I might add
with a general attitude of Ireland.

898
01:07:12,375 --> 01:07:14,417
Isn't that terrible?

899
01:07:14,542 --> 01:07:17,792
Isn't that just so damnably
fucking wicked of me?

900
01:07:22,458 --> 01:07:26,917
Everyone is going to know...
what I know.

901
01:07:28,167 --> 01:07:30,333
I'll pray for you.

902
01:07:30,458 --> 01:07:32,125
(Woman) Oh!

903
01:07:34,125 --> 01:07:36,792
(Rose) I'll see you in court!

904
01:07:40,750 --> 01:07:42,792
(Overlapping shouting)

905
01:07:47,583 --> 01:07:49,833
(Officer) Step back!

906
01:07:49,958 --> 01:07:51,833
- Order!
- Step back!

907
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:57,542
(Crowd muttering)

908
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:02,333
Please be seated
for Judge Maccleston.

909
01:08:03,083 --> 01:08:07,083
(Lawyer) Miss Gooding,
you know why you're here, I suppose.

910
01:08:07,208 --> 01:08:11,208
- Is it the letters, by any chance?
- (Crowd laughing)

911
01:08:11,917 --> 01:08:14,042
(Judge) Order!

912
01:08:15,375 --> 01:08:17,250
Will you take a look
at this list of people,

913
01:08:17,375 --> 01:08:20,250
and pick out any names
that you don't know?

914
01:08:32,167 --> 01:08:34,707
I know all of them,
one way or another.

915
01:08:34,832 --> 01:08:37,542
Did you know that
that is the list of all the people

916
01:08:37,667 --> 01:08:40,457
- who've been sent poison-pen letters?
- It occurred to me, yes.

917
01:08:40,582 --> 01:08:45,125
Isn't it an extraordinary coincidence
that you know them all?

918
01:08:45,250 --> 01:08:48,750
- It would appear that way, yes.
- (Lawyer) Thank you, m'lud.

919
01:08:48,875 --> 01:08:53,167
You're a mother
to a darling daughter Nancy.

920
01:08:53,292 --> 01:08:56,417
- Darling? Some of the time.
- (Laughing)

921
01:09:00,625 --> 01:09:04,667
Erm... and your husband gave his life
for this nation in the war?

922
01:09:04,792 --> 01:09:08,582
- Well, he wasn't the only one.
- That must've been unimaginably hard.

923
01:09:08,707 --> 01:09:12,875
It was, yes. But you keep going,
and she's worth it, just about, anyway.

924
01:09:16,707 --> 01:09:21,125
I suppose you'd miss your daughter,
if you went to jail.

925
01:09:24,207 --> 01:09:25,500
So much.

926
01:09:26,207 --> 01:09:29,707
So why would you send so many letters
that are so easily traceable back to you?

927
01:09:29,832 --> 01:09:31,957
I wouldn't. That'd be insanity.

928
01:09:32,082 --> 01:09:34,582
After all, you're known
for being somewhat direct.

929
01:09:34,707 --> 01:09:36,707
Why would I send a letter,
when I can just say it?

930
01:09:36,832 --> 01:09:38,082
(Crowd muttering)

931
01:09:38,207 --> 01:09:39,625
Thank you, m'lud.

932
01:09:42,417 --> 01:09:44,875
Thank you for joining us, Miss Swan,

933
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:49,750
at a time that must be filled
with grief and dismay.

934
01:09:50,667 --> 01:09:55,500
Your mother was the treasurer
of the Christian Wives, wasn't she?

935
01:09:55,625 --> 01:10:00,583
Yes, we're all humble servants to the CW
in our family, by the grace of God.

936
01:10:03,417 --> 01:10:06,708
Can you please read this out,
Miss Swan?

937
01:10:12,625 --> 01:10:15,500
No? Alright.

938
01:10:16,958 --> 01:10:18,417
I'll do it.

939
01:10:25,208 --> 01:10:30,667
"You fucking old steaming bag
of wet leaking shit!

940
01:10:30,792 --> 01:10:34,292
"Your fucking arse is bigger
than the moon,

941
01:10:34,417 --> 01:10:39,042
"and your cat wants
a good fucking burning, too,

942
01:10:39,167 --> 01:10:43,458
- "I reckon, you stupid big stinker!"
- (Laughing)

943
01:10:43,583 --> 01:10:48,375
- "You mangy old titler's turnip..."
- (Judge) Order!

944
01:10:48,500 --> 01:10:51,875
- Silence in the court!
- Thank you, m'lud.

945
01:10:52,667 --> 01:10:55,292
- "You salty old sod."
- (Laughing)

946
01:10:55,417 --> 01:10:57,292
Erm...

947
01:10:58,583 --> 01:11:01,500
How does this make you feel,
Miss Swan?

948
01:11:02,333 --> 01:11:04,875
I don't know.
Not good, not good at all.

949
01:11:07,333 --> 01:11:09,167
(Lawyer) M'lud...

950
01:11:13,625 --> 01:11:15,625
Is this your handwriting, Miss Swan?

951
01:11:17,250 --> 01:11:18,417
It is.

952
01:11:18,542 --> 01:11:23,708
And can you confirm that
that is the 'G' you normally write with?

953
01:11:25,042 --> 01:11:26,500
I think so.

954
01:11:27,417 --> 01:11:29,333
Not many people write 'Gs' like that,
do they?

955
01:11:29,958 --> 01:11:33,000
I suppose not. I like to make an effort
in all my endeavours.

956
01:11:33,125 --> 01:11:39,000
And can you examine the 'G'
in exhibit 4-C here?

957
01:11:40,500 --> 01:11:42,333
Is that the same?

958
01:11:45,292 --> 01:11:46,833
- Yes.
- (Lawyer) Yes.

959
01:11:46,958 --> 01:11:52,125
And can you examine the 'G'
in exhibit 4-D?

960
01:11:52,250 --> 01:11:54,000
Is that the same?

961
01:11:54,125 --> 01:11:55,750
No.

962
01:11:55,875 --> 01:12:01,542
No. 4-D is Rose Gooding's handwriting

963
01:12:01,667 --> 01:12:04,167
from a letter to the bank.

964
01:12:04,292 --> 01:12:10,292
And what would you say if I said
that the 'G' in 4-C,

965
01:12:10,417 --> 01:12:14,708
the same as your 'G',
was in fact the 'G' that appears...

966
01:12:15,750 --> 01:12:17,458
...in the Littlehampton letters?

967
01:12:17,583 --> 01:12:22,375
(Lawyer 2) Objection, m'lud! Handwriting
analysis is completely spurious!

968
01:12:22,500 --> 01:12:24,500
- (Crowd murmuring)
- (Judge) Please! Please!

969
01:12:24,625 --> 01:12:26,417
- You...
- (Judge) Silence!

970
01:12:28,125 --> 01:12:29,708
Miss Swan?

971
01:12:30,333 --> 01:12:31,500
No.

972
01:12:31,625 --> 01:12:34,625
(Lawyer 2) I object, Your Honour.
Who is on trial here?

973
01:12:34,750 --> 01:12:37,750
(Lawyer) Trying to establish reasonable
doubt in the accusation of my client.

974
01:12:37,875 --> 01:12:43,708
And the 'G' in this letter
is the same. Isn't it?

975
01:12:45,250 --> 01:12:47,125
Isn't it?

976
01:12:47,250 --> 01:12:48,958
Yes, but lots of people
probably do those 'Gs'.

977
01:12:49,083 --> 01:12:51,625
You just said you didn't think
people would use...

978
01:12:51,750 --> 01:12:54,583
- I don't know, I don't know.
- Why is it the same 'G', Miss Swan?

979
01:12:54,708 --> 01:12:56,708
I can't explain it,
I can't explain any of it.

980
01:12:56,833 --> 01:13:00,750
- M'lud, Miss Swan is recently bereaved...
- I never meant it to go to trial.

981
01:13:00,875 --> 01:13:03,667
Really, I didn't. My father taught me
to do those 'Gs'...

982
01:13:03,792 --> 01:13:05,750
Did you write the letters?

983
01:13:05,875 --> 01:13:09,667
- My lord, this is harassing!
- Please don't... don't... don't worry.

984
01:13:10,667 --> 01:13:14,208
Don't worry.
Cos none of it matters really.

985
01:13:14,333 --> 01:13:17,042
- I beg your pardon?
- God's is the only justice.

986
01:13:17,167 --> 01:13:20,875
All that happens, he makes it so.
All is well. All is well...

987
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:22,708
(Crowd) Oh!

988
01:13:24,083 --> 01:13:29,625
(Judge) Right, er...
let us convene there... shall we?

989
01:13:31,042 --> 01:13:33,875
Enough of this.
Just expose everything...

990
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,542
(Angry muttering)

991
01:13:39,167 --> 01:13:43,583
We would like to recall Miss... Gooding.

992
01:13:43,708 --> 01:13:45,250
(Crowd murmuring)

993
01:13:49,875 --> 01:13:55,042
Miss Gooding... would you say that
the death of your husband at war...

994
01:13:55,875 --> 01:13:58,583
...has affected your mind or sanity?

995
01:13:58,708 --> 01:14:01,208
- We object!
- We will allow it.

996
01:14:05,250 --> 01:14:07,792
No. I've always been like this.

997
01:14:07,917 --> 01:14:09,417
(Crowd laughing)

998
01:14:09,542 --> 01:14:14,292
Do get on to the line of enquiry,
Mr Treading.

999
01:14:17,042 --> 01:14:21,417
Erm... Miss Gooding,
what was your late husband's name?

1000
01:14:21,542 --> 01:14:23,458
My husband?
What's that got to do with this?

1001
01:14:23,583 --> 01:14:27,125
- Just making sure we have all the facts.
- Why does it matter?

1002
01:14:27,250 --> 01:14:30,542
You... don't know his name?

1003
01:14:31,750 --> 01:14:33,208
(Crowd muttering)

1004
01:14:33,333 --> 01:14:36,500
- Of course I know his name.
- M'lud!

1005
01:14:36,625 --> 01:14:38,708
Er... go on.

1006
01:14:42,042 --> 01:14:43,833
Did your husband die in the war?

1007
01:14:49,042 --> 01:14:50,667
Yes.

1008
01:14:52,250 --> 01:14:55,792
Then why, Miss Gooding,
is there no record whatever

1009
01:14:55,917 --> 01:14:58,958
of any marriage of you to anyone

1010
01:14:59,083 --> 01:15:02,292
in any record that we can find here,

1011
01:15:02,417 --> 01:15:05,042
or where you purport
to have come from?

1012
01:15:05,167 --> 01:15:06,875
(Crowd muttering)

1013
01:15:09,542 --> 01:15:11,000
(Crowd quietens)

1014
01:15:14,542 --> 01:15:17,208
- I don't know.
- Did you lie about this marriage?

1015
01:15:17,333 --> 01:15:19,708
- No.
- Did you lie to cover up...

1016
01:15:19,833 --> 01:15:21,667
...the illegitimate birth
of your daughter Nancy?

1017
01:15:21,792 --> 01:15:23,583
Don't you dare talk about Nancy
that way?

1018
01:15:23,708 --> 01:15:25,500
- Is that why you came to Littlehampton?
- No!

1019
01:15:25,625 --> 01:15:28,917
To cover up the sin
of a child born out of wedlock?

1020
01:15:29,042 --> 01:15:30,042
No!

1021
01:15:30,167 --> 01:15:35,000
To fabricate a sympathetic story
of a fictitious husband

1022
01:15:35,125 --> 01:15:37,042
who happened to die in the Great War?

1023
01:15:37,167 --> 01:15:41,542
To trade off other people's heroism,
off their death?

1024
01:15:41,667 --> 01:15:43,958
- What would you do?
- (Crowd) Oh!

1025
01:15:49,708 --> 01:15:52,042
- (Judge) Order!
- (Shouting)

1026
01:15:52,167 --> 01:15:54,000
Order!

1027
01:15:57,958 --> 01:16:00,917
(Treading) I put it to you
that you are a serial liar.

1028
01:16:01,042 --> 01:16:05,750
A serial creator of falsehoods
and personas.

1029
01:16:05,875 --> 01:16:08,250
One: the upright mother.

1030
01:16:08,375 --> 01:16:09,792
One: the tart.

1031
01:16:09,917 --> 01:16:13,250
And one: the writer
of the Littlehampton letters!

1032
01:16:13,375 --> 01:16:15,000
What say you?

1033
01:16:15,125 --> 01:16:17,208
(Crowd murmuring)

1034
01:16:19,667 --> 01:16:22,750
- (Judge) Silence!
- (Gavel beating)

1035
01:16:24,208 --> 01:16:25,625
M'lud.

1036
01:16:25,750 --> 01:16:29,792
(Judge) We will reconvene on Monday
for the giving of verdict by jury.

1037
01:16:31,333 --> 01:16:32,958
Good day.

1038
01:16:33,875 --> 01:16:36,542
(Overlapping conversations)

1039
01:17:07,667 --> 01:17:10,208
Nancy's asleep upstairs.

1040
01:17:14,375 --> 01:17:17,125
I told you, it was for her sake, Bill.

1041
01:17:18,333 --> 01:17:20,167
You told my mother.

1042
01:17:21,958 --> 01:17:25,542
Told her about the moment
you got the news. You told everyone.

1043
01:17:25,667 --> 01:17:28,500
I had no choice, Bill.
You know I didn't. I had to say...

1044
01:17:28,625 --> 01:17:31,042
But you didn't have to say it to me!

1045
01:17:32,958 --> 01:17:34,458
I'm going...

1046
01:17:36,417 --> 01:17:38,542
I'm going to lose her, Bill.

1047
01:17:39,792 --> 01:17:41,625
Who's her father?

1048
01:17:44,125 --> 01:17:46,958
(Rose) Don't... don't do that.

1049
01:17:47,917 --> 01:17:50,333
- Who's her father?
- He was no good to me.

1050
01:17:50,458 --> 01:17:52,833
I didn't want her seeing that.
I had to leave.

1051
01:17:54,167 --> 01:17:56,625
No, Bill, don't go! Please!

1052
01:17:58,167 --> 01:17:59,625
Fuck!

1053
01:18:01,917 --> 01:18:03,500
No... Nancy!

1054
01:18:04,458 --> 01:18:07,417
Nancy! What are you doing?
Give it here!

1055
01:18:07,542 --> 01:18:11,833
I don't want you! They all think
you're a loon! Look, just fuck off!

1056
01:18:11,958 --> 01:18:14,125
- What did you say?
- (Nancy) It's your fault, you're a freak!

1057
01:18:14,250 --> 01:18:16,875
You're a slut, and you're living in sin!
You belong in jail!

1058
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,875
Nancy, no! I'm sorry!

1059
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:21,625
I'm sorry.

1060
01:18:31,333 --> 01:18:32,958
(Door slams)

1061
01:18:33,083 --> 01:18:36,125
(Chuckling) Nearly there.

1062
01:18:37,042 --> 01:18:39,208
She won't survive all this.

1063
01:18:40,125 --> 01:18:44,250
You have to stay calm.
And then things'll get back to normal.

1064
01:18:46,333 --> 01:18:47,750
Well...

1065
01:18:49,333 --> 01:18:51,875
...almost, eh?

1066
01:18:54,667 --> 01:18:57,292
You don't like the idea
of me leaving this house, do you?

1067
01:19:02,625 --> 01:19:04,958
That's why you sent Sidney away,
isn't it?

1068
01:19:08,792 --> 01:19:11,083
I bet you called the CPS on Rose, and all.

1069
01:19:18,708 --> 01:19:20,458
I liked him.

1070
01:19:23,708 --> 01:19:25,875
I liked them both.

1071
01:19:28,458 --> 01:19:30,208
No...

1072
01:19:32,583 --> 01:19:34,583
You don't know what you like.

1073
01:19:37,667 --> 01:19:39,458
Now, tidy up...

1074
01:19:40,875 --> 01:19:43,458
...and no more of this shit.

1075
01:20:18,208 --> 01:20:19,875
Turn around.

1076
01:20:21,458 --> 01:20:25,208
Alright, Dad... what would you do?

1077
01:20:34,958 --> 01:20:38,958
No, no, the other way.
Winnie, stay still.

1078
01:20:42,708 --> 01:20:44,458
- What?
- Are you busy?

1079
01:20:44,583 --> 01:20:47,125
- I'm just boiling an egg.
- Right, come on, then!

1080
01:20:47,250 --> 01:20:50,042
What? No, as in, "Yes, I'm busy,
I'm boiling an egg."

1081
01:20:50,167 --> 01:20:52,542
Hurry up! I've had an idea.

1082
01:20:53,625 --> 01:20:55,375
- Shh!
- (Bird chirruping)

1083
01:20:56,292 --> 01:20:57,458
Yes?

1084
01:20:57,583 --> 01:20:59,625
You don't still think
Rose is guilty, do you?

1085
01:20:59,750 --> 01:21:01,500
Were you at the trial?

1086
01:21:02,500 --> 01:21:05,125
Come on over to mine, then. Now.

1087
01:21:05,250 --> 01:21:06,958
We'll be boiling eggs.

1088
01:21:07,083 --> 01:21:08,500
Oh.

1089
01:21:08,625 --> 01:21:11,917
- I'm not standing for it.
- I should think not.

1090
01:21:13,625 --> 01:21:15,208
Come on, then.

1091
01:21:15,333 --> 01:21:18,208
Rose is about to go down
for something she didn't do.

1092
01:21:18,333 --> 01:21:21,625
- Now, I have a plan...
- No, sorry. Fuck you, no.

1093
01:21:21,750 --> 01:21:23,708
I won't listen to another word
till my egg.

1094
01:21:23,833 --> 01:21:26,750
Can you really not wait?
You're such an energetic person usually.

1095
01:21:26,875 --> 01:21:28,875
That's the fucking eggs!

1096
01:21:31,667 --> 01:21:34,000
Hmm. Worth its weight in gold.

1097
01:21:34,125 --> 01:21:35,708
'Preciated.

1098
01:21:35,833 --> 01:21:37,208
Apologies.

1099
01:21:37,333 --> 01:21:39,750
- Where were we?
- As I was saying...

1100
01:21:40,833 --> 01:21:44,708
I have a plan. And the first things
we need are salt...

1101
01:21:44,833 --> 01:21:48,292
'Red cabbage, ammonia,
lemon, vinegar.'

1102
01:21:48,417 --> 01:21:50,542
And baking soda.

1103
01:21:50,667 --> 01:21:53,042
I need to dissolve this.
Can I have some of yours?

1104
01:21:53,167 --> 01:21:55,542
(Kate) Yeah, gimme a sec.

1105
01:21:55,667 --> 01:21:58,042
- There's a hair in there.
- (Ann) That'll dissolve.

1106
01:21:58,167 --> 01:22:00,083
Shall I remove the hair
or keep it in?

1107
01:22:00,208 --> 01:22:02,333
- No, leave it in.
- (Gladys) Does that look alright?

1108
01:22:02,458 --> 01:22:03,708
(All) Hmm...

1109
01:22:03,833 --> 01:22:06,042
(Gladys) While the judge
considers the sentence,

1110
01:22:06,167 --> 01:22:08,375
Edith has one more chance
of sending a letter,

1111
01:22:08,500 --> 01:22:11,167
and we'll catch her in the act.

1112
01:22:11,292 --> 01:22:14,042
"You foxy-arse rabbit-fucker.

1113
01:22:14,167 --> 01:22:17,958
"God will punish you,
you bloody, fucking, buggered fucks."

1114
01:22:18,083 --> 01:22:21,375
The letter must be incontrovertibly hers,
or it won't stick.

1115
01:22:21,500 --> 01:22:24,750
- Jesus, pass the dictionary.
- It means definitely.

1116
01:22:24,875 --> 01:22:26,875
Well, say "definitely" then, Gladys.

1117
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:30,917
(Gladys) 'Hence... the invisible ink.'

1118
01:22:31,042 --> 01:22:33,458
(All) Oh...

1119
01:22:33,583 --> 01:22:37,667
"Judge Maccleston,
22, Sea Street, Lewes."

1120
01:22:46,625 --> 01:22:48,625
(Birds chirruping)

1121
01:22:51,708 --> 01:22:54,042
(Mimicking birds chirruping)

1122
01:23:04,958 --> 01:23:06,833
(Whistles)

1123
01:23:21,875 --> 01:23:23,083
(Door opens)

1124
01:23:29,542 --> 01:23:33,042
(Man) I'd like to send this
to Lewes, please.

1125
01:23:33,167 --> 01:23:35,583
- Oh! Sorry, guys!
- Oh, really?

1126
01:23:35,708 --> 01:23:38,917
Sorry, sorry. I'll take over.

1127
01:23:39,042 --> 01:23:40,708
Thanks so much.

1128
01:24:01,292 --> 01:24:03,292
Where am I going, eh?

1129
01:24:11,750 --> 01:24:13,208
Shh!

1130
01:24:22,958 --> 01:24:24,958
(Ann) She's going in.

1131
01:24:27,500 --> 01:24:29,958
Oh, Edith!
What a nice surprise.

1132
01:24:30,583 --> 01:24:33,542
Hello, Kate.
One two-penny, please.

1133
01:24:37,625 --> 01:24:39,792
The offer still stands with those cuffs.

1134
01:24:39,917 --> 01:24:42,917
I think you should stop
asking me that now.

1135
01:24:55,500 --> 01:24:57,542
(Chicken clucking)

1136
01:24:57,667 --> 01:25:00,083
- Hey!
- Hmm?

1137
01:25:02,083 --> 01:25:04,500
Police are coming.
Go out the back.

1138
01:25:04,625 --> 01:25:07,458
- Go on, get out the back.
- Fuck it!

1139
01:25:11,083 --> 01:25:12,833
- Ready?
- Ready. You ready?

1140
01:25:12,958 --> 01:25:14,708
- I'm ready.
- Ready.

1141
01:25:14,833 --> 01:25:16,500
- Knock.
- Knock.

1142
01:25:17,375 --> 01:25:19,208
No, do the knock.

1143
01:25:20,167 --> 01:25:22,042
Yeah, I'll do the knock.

1144
01:25:30,500 --> 01:25:32,500
Miss Gooding's been judged
a risk of flight.

1145
01:25:32,625 --> 01:25:35,458
Spedding wants her in a cell
before the trial.

1146
01:25:36,458 --> 01:25:39,792
- Where is she?
- No idea, sir. Sorry.

1147
01:25:40,542 --> 01:25:42,792
(Papperwick) She must be in there.

1148
01:25:44,042 --> 01:25:46,208
- (Rose) Whoo!
- Oi!

1149
01:25:46,333 --> 01:25:49,208
- Well, get after her!
- You get after her, Papperwick!

1150
01:25:49,333 --> 01:25:51,333
And you! Get after her!

1151
01:25:52,333 --> 01:25:54,500
Get her now!

1152
01:26:19,292 --> 01:26:22,333
- Have you seen her?
- That way.

1153
01:26:22,875 --> 01:26:24,917
- (Spedding) Come on, keep up!
- (Papperwick) Yes, sir!

1154
01:26:25,042 --> 01:26:26,875
Right behind you, sir!

1155
01:26:42,917 --> 01:26:44,583
Oh, fuck!

1156
01:27:16,375 --> 01:27:19,625
Go on, Edie.
Post it, won't you?

1157
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:29,583
Oi! You gonna post that,
you daft old fucker?

1158
01:27:29,708 --> 01:27:32,458
- You fucking slippery old fucking dodger!
- What are you doing?

1159
01:27:32,583 --> 01:27:35,083
- I'm just teaching you how to swear proper.
- What are you gonna do?

1160
01:27:35,208 --> 01:27:37,250
Nothing. I just wanted to talk to you.

1161
01:27:37,375 --> 01:27:40,000
- I notice you say "foxy-arse" a lot.
- Yeah?

1162
01:27:40,125 --> 01:27:42,125
And "piss country whore".
What is that?

1163
01:27:42,250 --> 01:27:44,083
I thought you didn't mind
a bit of blue language.

1164
01:27:44,208 --> 01:27:46,500
- Bit too rough for you suddenly, is it?
- Nobody swears like that.

1165
01:27:46,625 --> 01:27:49,125
- Yes, they do.
- "Foxy-arse, piss country whore"?

1166
01:27:49,250 --> 01:27:51,250
- That's really peculiar.
- Well, what would you say?

1167
01:27:51,375 --> 01:27:53,125
I dunno, I'd have to sit down
and actually write it,

1168
01:27:53,250 --> 01:27:56,083
but to you, I'd probably say that you look
like fucking Queen Victoria shoved

1169
01:27:56,208 --> 01:27:58,833
a fucking nettle up her fucking pussy,
I don't know.

1170
01:27:58,958 --> 01:28:01,042
Well, I think you're a fucking foxy-arse...

1171
01:28:01,167 --> 01:28:04,792
- Does it always have to be foxy-arse?
- You stink of cum and shit!

1172
01:28:04,917 --> 01:28:07,875
And the cakes you make look like they've
fallen out of some sheep's fucking arsehole!

1173
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:09,167
Better!

1174
01:28:09,292 --> 01:28:12,625
(Laughing)
The baking didn't insult me, but...

1175
01:28:12,750 --> 01:28:14,208
You've had so many cocks
up your fanny

1176
01:28:14,333 --> 01:28:18,458
that they've set up a fucking stall
and they're selling iced fucking buns!

1177
01:28:18,583 --> 01:28:21,708
It's better to be a slut
than a lie, though, Edith.

1178
01:28:24,542 --> 01:28:27,083
No, cos I could post this letter right now,

1179
01:28:27,208 --> 01:28:29,958
and not a single person
in the entire British Empire

1180
01:28:30,083 --> 01:28:32,667
would believe someone like you over me.

1181
01:28:33,500 --> 01:28:37,167
- I doubt that very much.
- Do you?

1182
01:28:39,333 --> 01:28:43,500
Oh, fuck it.
I was actually beginning to enjoy that.

1183
01:28:43,625 --> 01:28:45,583
(Blowing whistle)

1184
01:28:48,875 --> 01:28:51,167
- Oh!
- Miss Gooding, you're coming with us!

1185
01:28:51,292 --> 01:28:53,625
- What's all this now, Woman Officer Moss?
- Oh, Mr Spedding!

1186
01:28:53,750 --> 01:28:56,708
- Thank goodness you're here.
- Wait! Did you get that, Winnie?

1187
01:28:56,833 --> 01:28:59,167
(Winnie) Yes, Aunty Gladys!

1188
01:29:00,667 --> 01:29:02,500
- Caught it as it came in.
- Well done.

1189
01:29:02,625 --> 01:29:06,167
- (Rose) What the fuck?
- Could've been either of them.

1190
01:29:07,208 --> 01:29:11,833
Watch, as I develop the private mark
on this stamp.

1191
01:29:35,125 --> 01:29:38,250
We have a handful of witnesses
of Edith buying this stamp, sir.

1192
01:29:38,375 --> 01:29:41,167
- It is incontrovertibly hers.
- Means definitely.

1193
01:29:48,708 --> 01:29:51,875
I said if you meddled,
I'd be putting you in a cell myself.

1194
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:55,583
You said we had to find the culprit,
catch her in the act.

1195
01:30:14,833 --> 01:30:16,208
Miss Swan...

1196
01:30:18,583 --> 01:30:21,667
I am Police Officer Moss.

1197
01:30:21,792 --> 01:30:25,167
I must caution you that anything you say
will be taken down in writing.

1198
01:30:34,958 --> 01:30:38,458
(Judge) 'How do you find
the defendant Rose Gooding?'

1199
01:30:38,583 --> 01:30:41,958
(Man) 'Our verdict is "not guilty".'

1200
01:30:42,833 --> 01:30:44,708
(Cheering and applause)

1201
01:30:58,167 --> 01:31:01,333
- (Judge) Silence!
- (Gavel banging)

1202
01:31:01,458 --> 01:31:03,458
(Judge) Order! Quiet!

1203
01:31:05,542 --> 01:31:09,083
- Order in court!
- (Crowd chanting) Justice! Justice!

1204
01:31:10,625 --> 01:31:13,417
Tell you what, come this way,
the crowds...

1205
01:31:20,708 --> 01:31:22,958
Can you tell me why now, Edith?

1206
01:31:24,208 --> 01:31:26,000
Don't think I can, no.

1207
01:31:36,125 --> 01:31:38,125
I wish it hadn't been you.

1208
01:31:38,958 --> 01:31:41,333
Once they started, I just couldn't stop.

1209
01:31:46,667 --> 01:31:50,042
And I thought if I could only be like you,
I'd be alright.

1210
01:31:55,625 --> 01:31:59,208
Good day to you, Rose.
I'll write to you.

1211
01:32:00,792 --> 01:32:03,000
I'll brace myself.

1212
01:32:03,125 --> 01:32:05,125
(Chuckling)

1213
01:32:18,250 --> 01:32:19,875
(Overlapping chatter)

1214
01:32:22,083 --> 01:32:23,708
(Inaudible)

1215
01:32:25,333 --> 01:32:28,292
Oi! Come here.

1216
01:32:29,917 --> 01:32:32,542
- Not you, you feck!
- (Chuckles)

1217
01:32:45,875 --> 01:32:48,792
- You alright?
- (Whispers) Yeah.

1218
01:32:51,458 --> 01:32:53,500
Close your eyes.

1219
01:32:57,375 --> 01:32:59,292
Open them.

1220
01:33:07,250 --> 01:33:09,292
You've got your own now,
Nancy Gooding.

1221
01:33:13,083 --> 01:33:14,917
(Laughing)

1222
01:33:15,500 --> 01:33:17,500
(Officer) Stand back!

1223
01:33:18,667 --> 01:33:21,875
Well, that was a knotty one,
but we got her in the end.

1224
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:23,542
We did, we did.

1225
01:33:24,417 --> 01:33:26,208
Always had an inkling
it was her, actually.

1226
01:33:26,333 --> 01:33:29,292
Me, too. Me, too.
Suspected quite early.

1227
01:33:29,417 --> 01:33:34,667
I actually think I said on day dot...
thereabout.

1228
01:33:34,792 --> 01:33:38,083
(Reporter) Here she comes!
Miss Swan!

1229
01:33:38,208 --> 01:33:40,375
(Jeering and booing)

1230
01:33:40,500 --> 01:33:43,792
Edith! Edie! Edie!

1231
01:33:43,917 --> 01:33:46,792
- (Shouting)
- (Father) Edie!

1232
01:33:46,917 --> 01:33:49,125
- I know you didn't do it.
- Yes, I did.

1233
01:33:49,250 --> 01:33:51,167
- We'll get you bail.
- I did it, Father!

1234
01:33:51,292 --> 01:33:52,833
- When you get back...
- I'm not coming back.

1235
01:33:52,958 --> 01:33:55,500
- No, don't say that.
- I'm not coming back home to you ever!

1236
01:33:55,625 --> 01:33:56,875
- Where else are you gonna go?
- Anywhere!

1237
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:59,000
- Edie, shut up, shut up.
- Anywhere! Anywhere!

1238
01:33:59,125 --> 01:34:03,000
Oh, fuck off, you pasty old shrivelled
old piss bastard fucking old cunt!

1239
01:34:03,125 --> 01:34:04,958
(Crowd) Ooh!

1240
01:34:10,167 --> 01:34:11,792
(Giggling)

1241
01:34:13,167 --> 01:34:15,167
(Laughing)

1242
01:34:16,958 --> 01:34:18,500
(Cackling)
