1
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:28,100
An Israeli and a Palestinian
working together?

2
00:01:28,125 --> 00:01:28,944
Let's be serious.

3
00:01:28,969 --> 00:01:31,490
Even the big NGO's had
trouble making that happen.

4
00:01:31,515 --> 00:01:33,395
Obviously, because of the boycott,

5
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:36,580
the integrated commerce between
Israel and Palestine

6
00:01:36,605 --> 00:01:38,325
was almost non-existent,

7
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:40,155
but from the Palestinian side,

8
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:43,580
it was more than just a boycott
on Israeli commerce,

9
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:47,060
it was a moratorium on business
cooperation as well.

10
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:58,197
To be realistic,

11
00:01:58,222 --> 00:02:01,155
even if Palestinian and
Israeli businessmen

12
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:03,150
want to cooperate,

13
00:02:03,175 --> 00:02:05,366
the situation on the
ground made it impossible.

14
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:40,680
Yeah, I really thought
they were reckless.

15
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:43,740
We already had an ongoing
political process

16
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:45,460
happening at the same time.

17
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,681
When they took matters
into their own hands,

18
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:59,845
Of course, not everyone knew about the

19
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:01,446
political negotiations,

20
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,017
the secret peace talks,

21
00:03:03,018 --> 00:03:05,275
but everybody knew about the boycott.

22
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:08,780
So what these two did was very risky.

23
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,340
Hi. Nizar speaking.

24
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:58,620
Hey, Nizar.
<-You knew about this?>

25
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:01,180
I was going to call you Sunday morning.

26
00:04:01,205 --> 00:04:03,835
I didn't think it would
reach the media so fast.

27
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:08,870
You know I was abroad this week.
They spoke to my secretary.

28
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:10,780
I'm so sorry, Nizar.

29
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:13,180
Nizar?

30
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:16,060
Nizar?

31
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:27,060
So this is why I'm here.

32
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:31,380
To put out feelers. Everyone
says it's a crazy idea, but...

33
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:35,240
now I see that there are some
serious Palestinian businessmen,

34
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:37,300
and as you saw at the convention,

35
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:39,428
the Europeans
are willing to invest big-time

36
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:42,860
in green projects like this
in the future Palestinian state.

37
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:47,260
All we need is a pilot project
and see how things work out.

38
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:49,391
I don't imagine you're motivated by the

39
00:06:49,411 --> 00:06:51,126
quality of life of the Palestinians.

40
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:53,580
I didn't say that, but...

41
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:57,780
if people can benefit
from business, why not?

42
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:01,180
What about your partner?
Have you talked to him about it?

43
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:02,860
Not yet.

44
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:06,460
I've been putting it off.
I don't think he'll cooperate.

45
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:08,860
What if he doesn't?

46
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:12,340
If he doesn't, I'll invest in it myself.

47
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:15,740
We'll find a way.

48
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:26,100
It's a field that interests me very much.

49
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:29,700
Green solar energy is the future...
especially in Palestine.

50
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:33,740
A free Palestinian state
that does not rely on Israel.

51
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:36,180
Is that a problem?

52
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:39,595
If you're going to work with
my company, I hope you know

53
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:42,420
that I'm Israeli as well.

54
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:08,860
We have to meet then.
<-Yes, yes, of course.>

55
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:12,460
- <Where?>
- It's a good question.

56
00:15:13,543 --> 00:15:15,795
Is there any way
you can come to Ramallah?

57
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:19,700
Let me see if I can get you a permit.

58
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:59,180
Nizar, Shaul.
<-Shaul, my friend.>

59
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:01,180
I've been waiting for your call.

60
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:10,100
Thing is, Nizar...

61
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:12,900
I didn't get a permit for you.

62
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:18,846
Do you know about anything?

63
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:31,500
Well, we'll have to think
of something else.

64
00:20:05,942 --> 00:20:08,004
<-It's true that you
never visit us.>

65
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:36,580
Welcome to the Promised Land.

66
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:38,515
What did the soldiers want?

67
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:41,275
Nothing really, just a spot
check. Happens all the time.

68
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:43,680
It's hard to believe it's this
difficult to meet someone

69
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:46,140
who lives only 45 minutes away.

70
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:52,660
Look at us, sneaking around like
two thieves. This is absurd.

71
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:56,060
Careful.

72
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:57,540
You okay?

73
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:02,100
This road leads
to the settlement over here,

74
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:05,460
and the Palestinian town of
Beit Jala over there.

75
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:08,300
They simply did not finish the wall yet.

76
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:10,060
Soon we'll be separated.

77
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:22,180
You are in a Palestinian land
fully controlled by Israel.

78
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:42,780
There's another matter, Shaul.
- Yeah?

79
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:46,660
Do you work with...

80
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:48,380
settlers?

81
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:50,900
No.

82
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:55,420
Not as a matter of principle,
I just don't.

83
00:29:56,980 --> 00:30:00,900
I'll have a hard time working with you

84
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:04,180
if I know you do business
with the settlements.

85
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:06,980
Okay...

86
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:10,500
I usually don't like

87
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:13,900
when somebody is dictating to me

88
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:16,460
who I can or can't work with.

89
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:19,980
But in this case, I think it's worth it.

90
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:24,220
Any more conditions?
- No.

91
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:29,340
Actually, yes.
- Tell me.

92
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:32,580
Secrecy is the most
important thing at this point,

93
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:35,180
while we put it all together.

94
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:39,340
Okay.
- Going public, media,

95
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:42,700
that sort of thing
could cause lots of trouble.

96
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:45,500
Not to mention my family.

97
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:47,950
It would take me a hard
time to explain to them

98
00:30:47,951 --> 00:30:49,218
why I'm doing this.

99
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:54,860
So how was the homecoming
with the family?

100
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:56,760
I'm sure they were very happy to see you.

101
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:58,181
My mom is so happy.

102
00:30:58,182 --> 00:31:00,316
She's already looking for a wife for me.

103
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:03,300
It's okay, I've been there too.

104
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:06,340
Really? -Yes.
- Your mom also...?

105
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:08,060
Like this.

106
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:21,740
There is another thing
I have to tell you.

107
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:25,660
My sister, she lives in a settlement.

108
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:29,340
What can you do?

109
00:31:29,341 --> 00:31:32,515
Sometimes there are different
opinions in one family.

110
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:35,020
Then it's your problem, not mine.

111
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:37,940
Okay.

112
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:18,060
Shaul, what's up?

113
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:19,420
Check this out.

114
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:29,620
Nice, huh?

115
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:32,700
Very impressive.

116
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:36,620
We'll need the pictures of the
village as soon as you can.

117
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:39,721
I think I can send you the
final map in a few days.

118
00:34:39,722 --> 00:34:40,922
- Good. - Excellent.

119
00:49:23,220 --> 00:49:24,700
Hey, Nizar.

120
00:49:27,100 --> 00:49:29,300
Listen, we have to meet and talk.

121
00:49:29,380 --> 00:49:31,260
What's there to talk about?

122
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:33,380
You screwed the whole thing.

123
00:49:33,460 --> 00:49:34,980
I warned you.

124
00:49:35,060 --> 00:49:37,500
Okay, so let's meet then.
We'll discuss the problems

125
00:49:37,580 --> 00:49:38,940
and solve them.

126
00:49:39,100 --> 00:49:40,980
Come to Ramallah, solve my problems.

127
00:49:41,060 --> 00:49:43,540
Great, Nizar. You know
I can't come to Ramallah.

128
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:48,100
I haven't left my house
for a week, Shaul.

129
00:49:51,060 --> 00:49:53,900
Forget it.
I'll talk to you later.

130
00:52:12,660 --> 00:52:14,140
Listen, Nizar,

131
00:52:14,940 --> 00:52:17,620
I came to apologize for what happened.

132
00:52:18,620 --> 00:52:21,020
My secretary, she did not know better

133
00:52:21,100 --> 00:52:23,660
when the reporter called
and I was abroad...

134
00:52:23,740 --> 00:52:26,500
I warned you, this is serious.
- I know.

135
00:52:27,700 --> 00:52:31,060
I got in trouble myself
with my own family.

136
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:33,540
I'm not trying to avoid responsibility,

137
00:52:33,620 --> 00:52:36,980
and I know the pressure on you
is much greater, but...

138
00:52:40,140 --> 00:52:44,780
I have to tell you, Nizar,
that when we met a year ago,

139
00:52:45,900 --> 00:52:48,140
I was purely thinking business

140
00:52:48,220 --> 00:52:51,540
and Palestine was just
another market to exploit.

141
00:52:53,660 --> 00:52:55,220
But things have changed.

142
00:52:56,340 --> 00:52:59,460
I feel invested in something
that is meaningful,

143
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:02,620
and it's because of you, Nizar.

144
00:53:04,140 --> 00:53:07,220
And all this added pressure now
makes me realize

145
00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:09,700
that what we're doing really matters.

146
00:53:09,875 --> 00:53:12,221
It makes a difference in people's lives

147
00:53:12,246 --> 00:53:13,595
and we must go on.

148
00:53:13,620 --> 00:53:15,500
It's not just pressure.

149
00:53:16,100 --> 00:53:18,500
It's a life threat I'm dealing with here.

150
00:53:18,580 --> 00:53:20,460
Do you understand that?

151
00:53:20,860 --> 00:53:22,460
I know.

152
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:25,300
Believe me...

153
00:53:26,660 --> 00:53:28,900
I'm here in Ramallah, no?

154
00:53:33,620 --> 00:53:35,580
Sorry you have to drink my coffee.

155
00:53:35,700 --> 00:53:37,540
My mom's not here.

156
00:53:39,220 --> 00:53:41,298
You know, last time I was in Ramallah

157
00:53:41,299 --> 00:53:42,966
was when I was a soldier.

158
00:53:43,380 --> 00:53:45,060
20 years ago.

159
00:53:46,980 --> 00:53:50,660
But I have to admit that I feel
much safer now. -Really?

160
00:53:51,340 --> 00:53:54,380
You're probably shaking
in your boots right now.

161
00:54:00,660 --> 00:54:02,060
The truth is,

162
00:54:02,580 --> 00:54:04,420
I'm touched you came.

163
00:54:09,700 --> 00:54:11,020
Smells good.

164
00:54:11,460 --> 00:54:13,300
Let's see how it tastes.

165
00:54:19,580 --> 00:54:21,660
That's my brother, Tarek.

166
00:54:25,100 --> 00:54:27,500
He was killed in the first Intifada.

167
00:54:30,140 --> 00:54:32,060
He was only 14.

168
00:54:33,860 --> 00:54:35,660
You never mentioned it.

169
00:54:36,980 --> 00:54:38,980
Should I have said something?

170
00:54:42,860 --> 00:54:44,420
You know what, Shaul?

171
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:46,260
We should not stop.

172
00:54:46,940 --> 00:54:48,494
We cannot sit back anymore,

173
00:54:48,495 --> 00:54:50,715
hoping that no one will notice us.

174
00:54:50,740 --> 00:54:54,540
We should fight back,
make it clear what we stand for.

175
00:54:54,620 --> 00:54:57,060
What do you mean?
- Facebook.

176
00:54:57,860 --> 00:54:59,140
Facebook?

177
00:54:59,220 --> 00:55:00,900
Yes, Facebook.

178
00:55:01,780 --> 00:55:03,300
Look around you.

179
00:55:04,180 --> 00:55:06,620
There are a lot of people like me and you

180
00:55:06,740 --> 00:55:10,060
who believe that we should
find a way how to live together,

181
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:12,620
using our energy for a better future.

182
00:55:12,820 --> 00:55:15,660
Many Israelis talk about wanting
to live together,

183
00:55:15,740 --> 00:55:19,580
but their voices are silenced
by the minority who don't.

184
00:55:19,660 --> 00:55:21,180
Exactly.

185
00:55:23,580 --> 00:55:26,540
You have to realize that we
cannot work in a bubble.

186
00:55:26,900 --> 00:55:30,700
If there's no political peace treaty,

187
00:55:31,540 --> 00:55:34,700
any initiative like ours
is destined to fail.

188
00:55:34,780 --> 00:55:37,620
Imagine if the pressure
comes from within.

189
00:55:37,940 --> 00:55:40,980
Imagine if the Palestinians
and the Israelis

190
00:55:41,060 --> 00:55:43,140
call their leaders to make peace.

191
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:45,180
That could be us.

192
00:55:46,860 --> 00:55:48,140
I'm in.

193
00:56:01,780 --> 00:56:03,660
This is a great name for the page.

194
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:05,260
Now it's your turn.

195
00:56:05,860 --> 00:56:07,380
In Hebrew.

196
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:11,580
"Under the Same Sun"

197
01:00:21,380 --> 01:00:23,380
I don't want to say it was unexpected.

198
01:00:23,660 --> 01:00:25,717
But the wave of the political movement

199
01:00:25,742 --> 01:00:27,324
caught everybody by surprise.

200
01:00:27,980 --> 01:00:29,660
It was overwhelming.

201
01:00:29,780 --> 01:00:33,060
The leaders had to respond
and meet the challenge.

202
01:00:33,660 --> 01:00:36,260
What's different this time is
that for the first time

203
01:00:36,380 --> 01:00:38,324
you can actually see masses of

204
01:00:38,349 --> 01:00:41,004
Palestinian and Israeli ordinary people

205
01:00:41,060 --> 01:00:44,860
working together, working
with one voice on the streets,

206
01:00:44,940 --> 01:00:47,048
and you can see their activities

207
01:00:47,073 --> 01:00:49,244
on the social network all around.

208
01:00:49,620 --> 01:00:52,100
And after a while, politicians

209
01:00:52,180 --> 01:00:54,820
couldn't just ignore these voices

210
01:00:54,900 --> 01:00:57,091
but I think that this time
they were forced to.

211
01:00:57,140 --> 01:00:58,640
The politicians all around the world

212
01:00:58,660 --> 01:01:01,860
they were forced
to actually act and talk.

213
01:04:45,020 --> 01:04:46,260
You see?

214
01:04:46,340 --> 01:04:49,140
They'll be able to turn on
the light even tomorrow.

215
01:04:49,220 --> 01:04:51,220
Bravo, bravo.

216
01:04:51,540 --> 01:04:54,780
Nizar, I know what
your pretty face looks like.

217
01:04:55,460 --> 01:04:58,900
Can you aim the phone
to the farm so I can see?

218
01:05:03,580 --> 01:05:04,820
It looks good.
