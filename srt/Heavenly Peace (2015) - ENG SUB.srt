00:00:13,958 --> 00:00:18,792
♫ Silent night ♫

2
00:00:19,534 --> 00:00:23,800
♫ Holy night ♫

3
00:00:24,386 --> 00:00:29,334
♫ All is calm ♫

4
00:00:29,333 --> 00:00:33,875
♫ All is bright ♫

5
00:00:33,875 --> 00:00:41,628
♫ Round yon Virgin, Mother and Chi..♫

6
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:54,142
- I have an urgent delivery.

7
00:00:54,167 --> 00:00:56,178
Please sign

8
00:00:56,475 --> 00:00:59,667
- Tell him to take his present and
shove it up his ass,

9
00:00:59,862 --> 00:01:02,958
so if there is anything else up there,
so it will shift  very nicely.

10
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:07,230
- The package is back.

11
00:01:07,324 --> 00:01:10,083
He says he's still too vulnerable to accept it,

12
00:01:10,245 --> 00:01:12,892
but he wishes you a merry Christmas.

13
00:01:12,917 --> 00:01:14,792
- Tell him to...

14
00:01:17,399 --> 00:01:19,943
Tell him to take the damn package.

15
00:01:19,943 --> 00:01:21,571
It is not a Christmas present

16
00:01:21,596 --> 00:01:24,775
It is dvds, his tooth-brush and some underwears.

17
00:01:25,147 --> 00:01:26,875
- He says it is not a present,

18
00:01:26,875 --> 00:01:29,417
even though he'd wanted to give you one.

19
00:01:29,833 --> 00:01:31,594
It's just few things you've left behind

20
00:01:31,594 --> 00:01:33,166
reminding him of you

21
00:01:33,349 --> 00:01:35,375
and it's too painful.

22
00:01:35,443 --> 00:01:36,730
- Take it back

23
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:38,875
and tell that bastard it's only fair

24
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:41,517
that he is the one hurt for a change.

25
00:01:41,542 --> 00:01:43,875
There is plenty of his crap lying around here

26
00:01:43,875 --> 00:01:45,792
and that is painful too.

27
00:01:46,077 --> 00:01:48,722
He could at least have the balls

28
00:01:48,722 --> 00:01:50,852
and pick them up in person.

29
00:01:50,882 --> 00:01:52,757
- He says he misses you

30
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,833
and if it is not too much trouble

31
00:01:54,833 --> 00:01:56,714
would you mind picking up your things,

32
00:01:56,714 --> 00:01:59,083
then he can see you before the year is out.

33
00:02:00,435 --> 00:02:03,302
- Oh, his lordship misses me...
- Hmm, hmmm...

34
00:02:03,303 --> 00:02:05,375
- Wow, very interesting.

35
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,465
Tell him to accept that fucking package or

36
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:10,083
I’ll throw it all in the trash

37
00:02:10,066 --> 00:02:12,042
and, since I want my cds back,

38
00:02:12,045 --> 00:02:13,958
tell him to be more specific about

39
00:02:13,958 --> 00:02:15,958
when I should drop by.

40
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:21,225
- When would it be convenient for him to visit ?

41
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:23,250
He doesn't want to cause you more stress.

42
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:24,670
He is just very sorry and

43
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:27,303
wants you to have a drama free Christmas.

44
00:02:27,829 --> 00:02:30,132
- Wait a minute.

45
00:02:30,164 --> 00:02:31,875
He wishes me

46
00:02:31,875 --> 00:02:33,917
a drama free Christmas ?

47
00:02:34,592 --> 00:02:37,458
Oh, that cake are fucking cakes !

48
00:02:38,417 --> 00:02:41,916
- He had tears in his eyes.

49
00:02:43,112 --> 00:02:44,625
- Fine...

50
00:02:44,701 --> 00:02:47,013
he can come by if he wants to.

51
00:02:47,013 --> 00:02:48,982
I'm not doing anything.

52
00:02:49,171 --> 00:02:51,067
Maybe some nice little presents...

53
00:02:51,092 --> 00:02:53,292
I don't care. Give me the package.

54
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:56,896
- He had tears in his eyes ?

55
00:02:57,197 --> 00:02:58,668
Oh, yeah... well...

56
00:02:58,693 --> 00:03:00,841
I could drop in on Christmas eve.

57
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:03,935
I'm not really in a festive mood, anyway

58
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,166
if he has no plans...

59
00:03:06,167 --> 00:03:08,417
- And of all the people in the world,

60
00:03:08,465 --> 00:03:11,007
he wants to spend Christmas eve with you.

61
00:03:11,042 --> 00:03:13,750
It's hard for him to admit it
after all that happened,

62
00:03:13,878 --> 00:03:16,375
but it's you or no one.

63
00:03:16,591 --> 00:03:19,406
- Tell him to come over and I stuff the chicken,

64
00:03:19,458 --> 00:03:21,458
but he can at least bring the wine

65
00:03:21,458 --> 00:03:23,792
and not some two bucks shop either

66
00:03:23,792 --> 00:03:26,458
and not Christmas tree or other romantic crap.

67
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:30,417
- Okay, I'll buy the tree

68
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,333
but it pisses me off that he falls over that tacky shit.

69
00:03:36,672 --> 00:03:38,750
- Merry Christmas.

70
00:03:38,893 --> 00:03:40,935
I love you.

71
00:03:41,868 --> 00:03:44,042
- I love you too.

72
00:03:53,305 --> 00:04:03,458

73
