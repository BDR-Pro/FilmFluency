1
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:58,600
There's some things
I never told you about Maria.

2
00:00:58,683 --> 00:01:01,811
Save the details till
after the honeymoon, homeboy.

3
00:01:05,148 --> 00:01:07,150
She has some problems.

4
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:36,429
Daddy, I think there's a snap undone.
Would you take a look?

5
00:01:37,805 --> 00:01:40,391
I don't think so, honey.
Are you sure?

6
00:01:44,896 --> 00:01:46,814
I'm not feeling very well.

7
00:01:46,898 --> 00:01:50,068
Of course you don't. You're getting
married. Get used to it.

8
00:01:54,072 --> 00:01:58,451
- Here we go.
- She's a bit compulsive.

9
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:02,455
Maybe I should say
compulsive and neurotic.

10
00:02:02,538 --> 00:02:04,749
Yeah, I know. She's Maria.

11
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:07,669
She sleeps with a flyswatter.

12
00:02:07,752 --> 00:02:11,172
Hell, if I looked like Maria,
I'd sleep with a bazooka.

13
00:02:12,507 --> 00:02:14,467
So you guys got some issues.

14
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:16,970
It's called modern romance.

15
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:34,612
If you need it, there's an ice chest
under your mother's seat.

16
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:39,993
I'm okay. I feel better now.

17
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:57,969
Careful of your dress, dear.

18
00:02:59,762 --> 00:03:05,310
She, uh... She cleans the house
twice a day on her day off.

19
00:03:05,393 --> 00:03:07,353
Yeah, well, at least she works.

20
00:03:07,395 --> 00:03:09,480
We get to go to all those
great magazine parties.

21
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:13,985
Hey, remember Claudia from
the "Elle" party? Oh, man.

22
00:03:14,068 --> 00:03:16,154
She's always locking
the bathroom door.

23
00:03:18,948 --> 00:03:21,659
She gets suicidal
from time to time.

24
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:24,579
All women get suicidal
from time to time.

25
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,337
God, I love her.

26
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:46,893
So how long have you
known all of this?

27
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:52,357
They just sort of creep up
on you, you know? One by one.

28
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:56,277
- And before you know it...
- I say, don't panic.

29
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:58,571
It's probably just a phase.

30
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:01,240
Yeah.

31
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:03,242
Yeah.

32
00:04:03,284 --> 00:04:05,244
Here she is.

33
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:15,255
- You guys are awfully late.
- We're supposed to be late.

34
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:18,383
- Mom, you got my train?
- I got it, dear.

35
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:23,554
- Come on, Dottie.
- I still think that dress is too tight.

36
00:04:25,056 --> 00:04:29,269
I require and charge you both as you
will answer on the Day ofJudgment...

37
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:33,398
when the secrets of all hearts
will be disclosed...

38
00:04:33,481 --> 00:04:36,234
that if either of you know
any impediment...

39
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:40,238
why you may not be lawfully
joined together in matrimony...

40
00:04:40,321 --> 00:04:42,323
do now confess it.

41
00:04:45,076 --> 00:04:46,995
{y:i}How much do you love me?

42
00:04:47,078 --> 00:04:49,372
Oh, a thousand.

43
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:52,500
Only a thousand?
That's not very much.

44
00:04:52,584 --> 00:04:57,171
I can even count to a thousand.
One, two, three, four...

45
00:04:57,255 --> 00:04:59,632
Okay, a hundred thousand
million billion.

46
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:05,597
That's better.
We're gonna be late for Alfred.

47
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:09,309
Yeah, but I love the reason.
Besides, myJuliet...

48
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:12,312
wilt thou leave me
so unsatisfied?

49
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:21,863
How much satisfaction
can'st thou get in 11 minutes?

50
00:05:22,947 --> 00:05:24,949
I'll be nicer in therapy.

51
00:05:33,082 --> 00:05:35,752
How about the issues
we were discussing last time?

52
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:38,296
Things are still the same.

53
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:42,342
He's not nice to my friends
or my parents.

54
00:05:42,383 --> 00:05:46,763
He's cheap. He flirts,
and he has a terrible temper.

55
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:50,475
But I'm a loving,
tolerant woman, so...

56
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:54,145
Oh, that feels so good.

57
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,906
She keeps bugging me to build
another room on to the house.

58
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:08,660
- We don't have any money, so...
- It would, of course...

59
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:11,496
put his car out in the driveway
for a couple of months.

60
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:13,581
Okay, okay.

61
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:17,460
Yes. Yeah.

62
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:21,464
Oh, right there.
Right there. Yes.

63
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:25,343
Maria, why is this new addition
to the house so important to you?

64
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:27,762
Because I wanna have a baby.

65
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:34,394
Go deeper.

66
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:38,898
With all this talk about a baby,
how's the sex?

67
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:43,194
You go first.

68
00:06:43,278 --> 00:06:45,321
- You want me to?
- Sure. Why not?

69
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:50,660
Okay.

70
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,042
I have a confession to make.

71
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:06,718
I fake my orgasms.

72
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:10,471
Oh! Oh! Oh!

73
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:14,892
- You what?
- I didn't wanna tell you.

74
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:18,062
I didn't want to hurt you.

75
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:22,400
You're telling me
you've never had an orgasm?

76
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:28,239
Not with you.

77
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:34,078
Joseph, it's important
you appreciate the risk...

78
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:36,539
Maria's taking in
communicating this to you.

79
00:07:58,061 --> 00:08:00,063
Do you think
I'm a lousy lover?

80
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:03,149
Hmm?

81
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:17,956
I love you, you know.

82
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:23,002
Whoa!

83
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:25,046
Tell the balcony crew
those doors are in.

84
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:28,007
Yo, Nick, you must have
fucked up big.

85
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:30,301
We is humbled by youse
royal presence, Sir Suits.

86
00:08:30,385 --> 00:08:31,594
Relax, Carlos.

87
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:35,807
Yo, Nick, I go out on a limb to get
you this job, like I always do...

88
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:39,352
I wouldn't work without you,
Joseph, my white patron saint.

89
00:08:39,435 --> 00:08:41,980
Well, thank you, Nick,
but the problem is...

90
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:44,774
we're about four months behind
after two months on the job.

91
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:47,986
You geniuses made the schedule.
I just took the job.

92
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:49,445
Hey, Nick, what's this?

93
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,990
Oh, yeah, go ahead, Tanner.
Take a look.

94
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:55,326
- Yeah?
- It's a little discovery of Carlos's.

95
00:08:55,410 --> 00:09:00,707
- Every hour on the hour.
- Holy shit! Oh, man!

96
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:02,667
This is unbelievable.
You gotta check this out.

97
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:05,211
- This is unbelievable.
- Must be the redhead.

98
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:10,925
Oh, man. Mm-hmm!

99
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:14,429
Ooh!

100
00:09:14,512 --> 00:09:16,514
You guys are perverts.

101
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:20,935
Are you kiddin'? This guy's
a national treasure. One of a kind.

102
00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:23,187
- Holy shit!
- What do you mean?

103
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:26,065
This guy has anywhere from four to
six women a day, one after the other.

104
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:29,193
And word has it he pleases
every one of'em.

105
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:33,823
- Joseph, take a look.
- No, I can see just fine.

106
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:37,535
Oh, my God!
Here comes another one.

107
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:44,292
I don't believe it. They just
passed each other and said hi.

108
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:47,211
They said hi to each other.

109
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:49,422
- Oh, Jesus.
- Tanner.

110
00:09:49,505 --> 00:09:51,424
- Yeah?
- Let's check out the site.

111
00:09:51,507 --> 00:09:54,385
All right, Joseph, I am. I am.

112
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:58,514
- It's gotta be an implant.
- An implant?

113
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,558
Yeah, an implant, you know.
A lot of guys got 'em.

114
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,518
It comes with a pump.

115
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:04,896
You just pump it up,
and it just stays there...

116
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:06,898
you know,
whenever you need it.

117
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:09,734
- Sounds like a good idea.
- Yeah, I gotta talk to that guy.

118
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:12,779
That redhead was to die for.
Oh, man, I wanna die.

119
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,783
- Tanner?
- Yeah?

120
00:10:16,824 --> 00:10:18,785
Does Vicky have orgasms?

121
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:21,496
- What?
- You know, does she...

122
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:25,250
Does she come when you're
doin' it, or does she fake it?

123
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:29,254
What? No!
Of course she has orgasms.

124
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:31,297
I mean, man, she goes crazy.

125
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:35,134
How do you know?
I mean, she could be fakin' it.

126
00:10:35,218 --> 00:10:37,887
You can tell. I mean,
they quiver all over.

127
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:40,765
Believe me, they quiver all over
even when they're fakin' it.

128
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:46,604
Shut the fuck up, would ya?

129
00:10:52,235 --> 00:10:54,237
Come on, Freddie,
you little bugger.

130
00:10:55,238 --> 00:10:57,156
Would you help me
with my tie, sweetheart?

131
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,242
Out, baby. Get out.

132
00:11:00,243 --> 00:11:01,953
Maria, we're gonna be late.

133
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:05,456
Freddie listened to me.
He just flew out the window.

134
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:07,458
How do you know it's a he?

135
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,711
Because it bugs me, darling,
so it must be a he.

136
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:16,467
How do I look?
Do I have lipstick on my tooth?

137
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:18,469
Honey, every time
we come see your parents...

138
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:20,847
you obsess
over the way you look.

139
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:23,850
Is my dress, okay? Do I need
to pull it down or anything?

140
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:26,603
You look fine.
Did you hear me?

141
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:30,356
Joseph, your tie is a mess.

142
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:37,864
Well, hello.
And how are the newlyweds?

143
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:40,033
- Hi, Dottie.
- We've been married seven months.

144
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:43,161
Yes, dear. Come on in.

145
00:11:44,287 --> 00:11:46,289
Your father's
in the living room.

146
00:11:51,336 --> 00:11:53,671
- Joseph, what are we...
- Surprise!

147
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:06,768
I'd say she's excited.
What would you say, hmm?

148
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:10,730
On a scale of one to ten,
about a four.

149
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:12,815
Oh, my God!

150
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:16,402
- Martini time.
- Yeah.

151
00:12:16,486 --> 00:12:20,365
How are you?
Oh, my gosh! Look at you!

152
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:39,717
Why is it when we go to parties...

153
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,886
I always have to track you down
with a homing device?

154
00:12:46,557 --> 00:12:49,227
If you loved me, you'd get in
that British fantasy of yours...

155
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:51,312
and drive me to Vegas.

156
00:12:54,565 --> 00:13:00,196
Okay, let's play
"If you love me," shall we?

157
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:04,659
- Go on. You start.
- Okay.

158
00:13:05,952 --> 00:13:09,455
If you loved me, you'd take me
to Paris on our second honeymoon.

159
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:17,714
If you loved me, you wouldn't miss
your appointments with Alfred.

160
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:20,258
You'd buy us a house
in Briarwood...

161
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:24,762
with a big pool
and a little froufrou dog.

162
00:13:26,848 --> 00:13:31,936
And you would stop
rearranging my closets.

163
00:13:33,855 --> 00:13:35,940
A baby girl...

164
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:38,026
and an air-conditioned garage...

165
00:13:38,109 --> 00:13:41,821
for my 1974 Ferrari
Daytona convertible.

166
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:47,744
- I love you, Maria.
- Shut up. It's still my turn.

167
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:50,663
It can always be
your turn, sweetheart.

168
00:13:50,705 --> 00:13:53,583
- Oh, baby, is that so?
- Mm-hmm.

169
00:13:59,297 --> 00:14:01,674
It's your turn now.

170
00:14:01,716 --> 00:14:03,927
Honey, that's enough.

171
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:06,471
Oh, we'll both know
when it's enough, darling.

172
00:14:11,142 --> 00:14:13,645
Joseph, even though
I can't have an orgasm...

173
00:14:16,606 --> 00:14:18,775
I still enjoy
making love to you.

174
00:14:30,787 --> 00:14:32,830
Sometimes I wonder
if he loves me.

175
00:14:38,336 --> 00:14:42,173
I feel he always avoids me.
He never returns my calls.

176
00:14:42,215 --> 00:14:44,717
His secretary, Connie,
is always apologizing for him.

177
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:46,719
That's not true.

178
00:14:46,761 --> 00:14:50,223
- You're distorting things again.
- Just let me finish, okay?

179
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:56,396
Connie is embarrassed
every time I call...

180
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:58,398
because he won't
pick up the phone.

181
00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:00,775
She practically admits
you're avoiding me.

182
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:02,694
She calls seven
or eight times a day.

183
00:15:02,777 --> 00:15:05,280
- Seven or eight?
- Yes, you do! And you embarrass me...

184
00:15:05,363 --> 00:15:07,865
in front of my secretary
and my associates.

185
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:10,827
Connie doesn't know
how to handle her because...

186
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,954
half the time you call,
you're hysterical.

187
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:15,665
I just need to connect with you
during the day, okay?

188
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:18,251
Just once or twice.
Is that too much to ask?

189
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:22,130
Just listen to her, Joseph.
Just listen to what she's saying.

190
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:24,716
You gotta be kidding me.

191
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:26,634
Why are you so afraid
of being close?

192
00:15:26,718 --> 00:15:29,220
Why in the hell are you
always focusing on me?

193
00:15:30,388 --> 00:15:32,599
I'm just tryin' to do
my job, for Christ's sakes...

194
00:15:32,682 --> 00:15:36,394
and all we ever do in here is
talk about her problems with me.

195
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:39,564
What I do, what I don't do,
who I am or who I'm not...

196
00:15:39,606 --> 00:15:42,275
that she has an issue with.

197
00:15:53,578 --> 00:15:55,997
I just... I can't handle it
when he gets so angry.

198
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:05,006
Joseph,
what is it you want?

199
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:09,218
I want a good marriage...

200
00:16:11,888 --> 00:16:13,890
a supportive wife.

201
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:19,312
And I wanna work
all these things out...

202
00:16:19,354 --> 00:16:21,314
so that we can have the baby
that she wants so much.

203
00:16:21,356 --> 00:16:23,775
Joseph, Maria's doing so much
better the past few months.

204
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:25,944
She's standing up for herself.
It's wonderful.

205
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:27,737
I know.

206
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:30,907
But she's still very fragile
with you at this point.

207
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:33,201
This kind of confrontation
can't work.

208
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:41,668
You're right. I know.

209
00:16:43,086 --> 00:16:46,214
It's just that I feel like I have
to stay on top of the situation...

210
00:16:46,297 --> 00:16:48,091
or it'll fall apart.

211
00:16:49,968 --> 00:16:52,011
She'll fall apart.

212
00:17:03,898 --> 00:17:06,317
Hello? Tanner!

213
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:10,154
No. No, I'll meet you
at the site.

214
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:42,974
You got a sick patient here,
Alfred. I suggest we talk in private.

215
00:19:45,685 --> 00:19:47,937
Come here, Alfred.
I have a few questions for you.

216
00:19:48,021 --> 00:19:51,357
Joseph, what's going on here now?
You're scaring me.

217
00:19:51,441 --> 00:19:53,359
That's good,
'cause you know what?

218
00:19:53,443 --> 00:19:56,154
I'm not totally in control
of myself right now.

219
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:58,364
Sit down, Alfred.

220
00:20:09,334 --> 00:20:11,544
What does the name
"Baltazar" mean to you?

221
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:19,177
You're gonna tell me everything...

222
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:21,888
and you're gonna start
with this doctor.

223
00:20:21,971 --> 00:20:24,223
Do you know him?
Did you refer her to him?

224
00:20:24,307 --> 00:20:27,226
No, no.
I don't know him.

225
00:20:27,268 --> 00:20:31,064
All I know is, he's a sex therapist
that practices on the edge of the law.

226
00:20:31,147 --> 00:20:35,693
They tried to shut him down,
but nobody will testify against him.

227
00:20:35,735 --> 00:20:37,779
Can you tell me
why she does this?

228
00:20:37,862 --> 00:20:40,865
Forget the bullshit psycho-babble.
I need to understand!

229
00:20:45,745 --> 00:20:50,333
All I can tell you, Joseph, is that
Maria exhibits most of the symptoms...

230
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:53,294
of what is called
a borderline personality.

231
00:20:54,671 --> 00:20:57,882
By that I mean
she has no real identity.

232
00:20:57,924 --> 00:21:02,637
She has to look outside of herself
for assurance, comfort, love.

233
00:21:05,556 --> 00:21:07,642
She can find
no sustenance within.

234
00:21:13,815 --> 00:21:17,443
- Shouldn't I have been told this?
- Oh, come on, Joseph.

235
00:21:17,527 --> 00:21:21,239
You've witnessed this for years.
I mean, her heightened personality...

236
00:21:21,322 --> 00:21:23,783
her need for control
at any cost...

237
00:21:23,825 --> 00:21:26,411
the fly obsession,
the phone calls.

238
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:31,416
Joseph, you lived it.

239
00:21:31,457 --> 00:21:33,501
You're the expert.

240
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:46,347
{y:i}Most borderlines
{y:i}are incurable, Joseph.

241
00:21:48,182 --> 00:21:50,852
{y:i}They need to be
{y:i}totally reparented.

242
00:22:04,115 --> 00:22:06,451
One of our construction sites
is on Hinton Street.

243
00:22:15,335 --> 00:22:17,295
I know about Baltazar.

244
00:22:19,339 --> 00:22:22,008
It's not what you think.

245
00:22:22,091 --> 00:22:24,510
Oh, really?
What is it then?

246
00:22:26,095 --> 00:22:28,681
Do you come with Baltazar?
Is that why you go?

247
00:22:28,765 --> 00:22:30,850
- To learn how to come?
- It's not about that.

248
00:22:30,934 --> 00:22:32,936
Then what is it about?

249
00:22:34,479 --> 00:22:38,524
You know what? You're a lie!
Our whole marriage is a lie.

250
00:22:38,608 --> 00:22:41,527
- Fuck you.
- You wanna tell me why?

251
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:44,614
I don't feel very close
to you right now.

252
00:22:44,697 --> 00:22:47,575
You don't feel very close
to me right now?

253
00:22:47,659 --> 00:22:49,702
You're paying some guy
to fuck you...

254
00:22:49,786 --> 00:22:52,830
and you don't feel
very close to me right now?

255
00:22:52,914 --> 00:22:55,833
- I'm your husband, for Christ's sakes...
- I don't care who you are.

256
00:23:24,362 --> 00:23:26,322
The door is open.

257
00:23:49,846 --> 00:23:51,848
Come in. Sit down.

258
00:24:06,112 --> 00:24:09,240
- Listen...
- Ah, you must beJoseph.

259
00:24:09,282 --> 00:24:13,703
I've been expecting you.
Maria's husband.

260
00:24:13,786 --> 00:24:15,747
She's a very special woman.

261
00:24:18,958 --> 00:24:22,378
Look, I don't know who you are
or what you think you do...

262
00:24:22,462 --> 00:24:25,798
but I need you to do me a kind favor
and stay away from my wife.

263
00:24:27,216 --> 00:24:30,136
- She's not a well woman.
- I agree.

264
00:24:30,178 --> 00:24:32,305
That's why she came to see me.

265
00:24:34,474 --> 00:24:37,936
Someone would have to be very
disturbed to come here seeking health.

266
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:42,941
You don't understand,
my friend.

267
00:24:45,485 --> 00:24:47,570
You understand this, Dr. Fuck!

268
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:52,158
You stay away
from my wife, okay?

269
00:24:52,241 --> 00:24:54,535
I know what goes on in here,
'cause I was here.

270
00:24:54,619 --> 00:24:58,331
And it wasn't love or therapy.
It wasn't even sex!

271
00:24:58,414 --> 00:25:00,416
It was sadistic abuse.

272
00:25:04,379 --> 00:25:07,840
I hope I've made myself clear.
It's over. Now.

273
00:25:23,231 --> 00:25:25,233
Cup of tea?

274
00:25:32,448 --> 00:25:34,659
I'm a therapist, Joseph.

275
00:25:34,701 --> 00:25:36,828
There's a reason
for everything I do.

276
00:25:39,497 --> 00:25:42,333
Acting out her abuse fantasy
is what enables Maria...

277
00:25:42,375 --> 00:25:45,503
to get past the guilt
and anxiety of being intimate.

278
00:25:48,214 --> 00:25:52,927
If we don't express these fantasies,
they run our lives insidiously.

279
00:25:53,011 --> 00:25:57,682
When she stops asking for abuse,
her need for it will be gone.

280
00:26:03,229 --> 00:26:06,649
This is insane.
It's insane.

281
00:26:06,733 --> 00:26:09,235
I'm sitting here having tea with
the doctor who's fucking my wife...

282
00:26:09,319 --> 00:26:11,529
and trying to convince me
that it's good for her.

283
00:26:11,613 --> 00:26:16,034
Don't you get it, man?
She needs medical help.

284
00:26:16,075 --> 00:26:20,955
Maria's been in traditional therapy
for seven years. Three therapists.

285
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:23,750
Which therapy do you think
will work at this point?

286
00:26:31,591 --> 00:26:34,510
Do you know what
a borderline personality is?

287
00:26:34,594 --> 00:26:37,722
They told you there was no cure,
and they were right.

288
00:26:37,805 --> 00:26:41,142
There is no
psychoanalytic cure.

289
00:26:41,225 --> 00:26:46,439
The mind...
cannot change the mind.

290
00:26:46,522 --> 00:26:48,816
Real change
is not a mental process.

291
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:57,075
Let me guess.
You think sex...

292
00:26:57,158 --> 00:27:01,120
your sex, in particular...
will heal Maria, is that it?

293
00:27:01,162 --> 00:27:04,248
Yes and no. I hold
no dominion over my teachings.

294
00:27:04,332 --> 00:27:06,292
I only know they work.

295
00:27:06,376 --> 00:27:10,964
But, yes, conscious sex
that achieves bliss...

296
00:27:11,047 --> 00:27:13,549
is the greatest healer there is.

297
00:27:15,176 --> 00:27:17,387
So the way to heal the woman
is to fuck her?

298
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:22,892
No. Conscious sex, physically
and emotionally integrated...

299
00:27:22,976 --> 00:27:25,561
is one way to heal
a human being.

300
00:27:25,645 --> 00:27:27,605
Ecstasy heals the unconscious.

301
00:27:29,232 --> 00:27:31,359
A woman can heal
a man as well.

302
00:27:31,442 --> 00:27:33,903
Well, I hope you
don't mind, Doctor...

303
00:27:33,987 --> 00:27:36,447
but I'm gonna try some
other approaches at this point.

304
00:27:36,489 --> 00:27:38,449
I know you love Maria, Joseph.

305
00:27:38,491 --> 00:27:41,035
I'm not here
to take that away from you.

306
00:27:43,955 --> 00:27:46,040
Just don't make me
take this any further.

307
00:27:49,669 --> 00:27:51,629
I am not the enemy.

308
00:27:54,424 --> 00:27:56,426
I don't know what you are.

309
00:31:05,573 --> 00:31:08,576
Oh, hi, sweetheart.
I'm almost done with the kitchen.

310
00:31:11,955 --> 00:31:15,250
- What are you doin'?
- What does it look like I'm doing?

311
00:31:16,376 --> 00:31:20,296
The entire house
is infested with bugs.

312
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:24,008
First I spray with the Raid
to kill any eggs, and then I seal.

313
00:31:25,009 --> 00:31:29,013
Maria, we discussed the fact that
flies do not lay eggs in the house.

314
00:31:29,097 --> 00:31:31,724
Ants, Joseph. Ants!

315
00:31:31,808 --> 00:31:34,352
The wastebasket was full
of them this morning.

316
00:31:39,274 --> 00:31:41,276
Maria, we've gotta talk.

317
00:31:41,359 --> 00:31:45,280
Okay. Just let me
finish the kitchen first.

318
00:31:46,281 --> 00:31:48,574
And if you wanna help, you can
start cleaning the bathroom.

319
00:31:48,658 --> 00:31:50,660
Just go through
your drawers, okay?

320
00:32:10,513 --> 00:32:12,807
Hi.

321
00:32:12,890 --> 00:32:15,059
What time is it?

322
00:32:17,604 --> 00:32:21,232
It's 5:45 a.m. You busy?

323
00:32:21,274 --> 00:32:24,611
No. No. Of course not.

324
00:32:25,987 --> 00:32:27,989
Well, I guess
we'll have some breakfast.

325
00:32:35,371 --> 00:32:37,373
Maria's gettin' worse.

326
00:32:39,667 --> 00:32:41,753
I'm sure she's very frightened.

327
00:32:45,131 --> 00:32:47,258
Therapy isn't working.

328
00:32:52,931 --> 00:32:55,099
I want you to teach me
what you do.

329
00:32:57,226 --> 00:32:59,187
You want to learn from me?

330
00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:01,230
I wanna learn
how to heal my wife.

331
00:33:02,732 --> 00:33:04,734
That's not possible.

332
00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:14,035
You fascinate me.
First you want to destroy me.

333
00:33:14,118 --> 00:33:16,287
Now you want
to become my acolyte.

334
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:23,461
Do you play
a musical instrument?

335
00:33:24,671 --> 00:33:26,172
No.

336
00:33:31,719 --> 00:33:35,974
Do you think you have the ability
to put aside your rage and listen?

337
00:33:36,057 --> 00:33:38,643
Look, the rage is gone, okay?

338
00:33:38,685 --> 00:33:41,813
The only thing that's important
to me now is helping Maria.

339
00:33:43,773 --> 00:33:45,692
If I agree to help you...

340
00:33:45,775 --> 00:33:49,404
you must understand
it means precisely that.

341
00:33:49,487 --> 00:33:54,200
I'm helping you.
Maria has her own path.

342
00:33:55,285 --> 00:33:57,328
I understand.

343
00:33:57,370 --> 00:34:01,582
- I'm not sure you do.
- And you have to promise me...

344
00:34:01,666 --> 00:34:04,002
that you'll never see Maria again.

345
00:34:04,043 --> 00:34:08,047
Ah! Is that what you're
really doing here, Joseph?

346
00:34:08,131 --> 00:34:11,593
- Preventing me seeing your wife?
- Do we have a deal or not?

347
00:34:14,262 --> 00:34:16,264
I doubt the rage is gone.

348
00:34:16,347 --> 00:34:20,184
But we can put it to good use.

349
00:34:20,226 --> 00:34:22,895
And I agree with you.

350
00:34:22,979 --> 00:34:24,981
As I teach you
the ways of love...

351
00:34:25,982 --> 00:34:29,110
it would not be
my place to see Maria.

352
00:34:33,489 --> 00:34:36,367
I saw you at the symphony
the other night.

353
00:34:36,451 --> 00:34:39,078
- I followed you there.
- I'm the substitute.

354
00:34:39,162 --> 00:34:42,957
I'd like to play more, but I don't
have the time to devote myself.

355
00:34:44,167 --> 00:34:46,085
So, we have a deal.

356
00:34:46,169 --> 00:34:50,298
You can choose to leave at any time,
and I may ask you to leave.

357
00:34:50,381 --> 00:34:55,887
But the work and our relationship
must remain strictly confidential.

358
00:35:09,609 --> 00:35:11,569
Do you really
love Maria that much?

359
00:35:18,576 --> 00:35:20,536
Too bad for you.

360
00:35:22,622 --> 00:35:26,542
{y:i}Okay, describe to me how
{y:i}you make love to a woman.

361
00:35:28,711 --> 00:35:32,674
And tell me, in detail,
when and how you make love.

362
00:35:35,385 --> 00:35:36,886
Well...

363
00:35:39,055 --> 00:35:42,058
one of us starts
kissing the other one...

364
00:35:42,141 --> 00:35:44,102
usually at night
before we go to bed.

365
00:35:47,855 --> 00:35:51,734
- Then I kiss her breasts for a while.
- How?

366
00:35:51,818 --> 00:35:53,319
How?

367
00:36:00,243 --> 00:36:01,911
I kiss.

368
00:36:03,454 --> 00:36:04,914
I suck...

369
00:36:07,333 --> 00:36:08,835
twirl my tongue.

370
00:36:12,130 --> 00:36:14,299
How does it feel?

371
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:16,050
Aroused.

372
00:36:19,012 --> 00:36:20,972
Like I want her.

373
00:36:22,098 --> 00:36:25,602
Then... kiss her tummy
for a while.

374
00:36:29,355 --> 00:36:32,233
Turn her over sometimes
and kiss her bottom.

375
00:36:33,443 --> 00:36:36,654
- I like to do that.
- How does she feel?

376
00:36:40,867 --> 00:36:42,410
I don't know.

377
00:36:52,003 --> 00:36:57,091
Then I usually kiss her
down there for a while.

378
00:36:57,175 --> 00:36:58,718
Down there?

379
00:36:58,801 --> 00:37:00,595
You mean, her vagina?

380
00:37:02,096 --> 00:37:03,681
Yeah?

381
00:37:03,765 --> 00:37:07,936
- Go on.
- And...

382
00:37:09,228 --> 00:37:13,650
Sometimes, I use my fingers.

383
00:37:13,733 --> 00:37:16,611
I... So I can hold her while we...

384
00:37:18,863 --> 00:37:20,406
You know.

385
00:37:29,123 --> 00:37:32,210
Then I get inside her...

386
00:37:33,544 --> 00:37:35,463
and we make love...

387
00:37:37,215 --> 00:37:39,175
like normal, I guess.

388
00:37:40,218 --> 00:37:42,011
Anything else?

389
00:37:45,515 --> 00:37:47,350
Sometimes she cries.

390
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:57,485
Does Maria
ever have an orgasm?

391
00:37:58,569 --> 00:38:00,363
No, I guess not.

392
00:38:00,446 --> 00:38:03,866
- Not with me anyway.
- Not with anyone, Joseph.

393
00:38:03,950 --> 00:38:06,244
Maria is frigid.

394
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:11,249
- Do you make love to yourself?
- Hmm?

395
00:38:11,291 --> 00:38:16,588
- Do you masturbate?
- No. No. Not...

396
00:38:16,629 --> 00:38:18,923
Rarely when I'm in a relationship.

397
00:38:19,007 --> 00:38:21,759
Well, we'll have to change that.

398
00:38:21,801 --> 00:38:23,761
How can you make love
to someone else...

399
00:38:23,803 --> 00:38:26,180
if you can't make love
to yourself?

400
00:38:31,477 --> 00:38:34,689
So, Joseph, what are you
doing to help Maria?

401
00:38:34,772 --> 00:38:37,734
Well, I do what I can, you know.
I try to make her go to therapy...

402
00:38:37,817 --> 00:38:40,111
Only do what I say.

403
00:38:40,153 --> 00:38:43,990
I don't want you to make love
to her until I say otherwise.

404
00:38:44,073 --> 00:38:48,328
I want you to hold her
and talk to her in bed...

405
00:38:48,411 --> 00:38:50,872
about intimate things...

406
00:38:50,955 --> 00:38:53,249
the most intimate feelings
you're having.

407
00:38:54,417 --> 00:38:58,630
When you sleep, spoon her.

408
00:38:58,671 --> 00:39:00,673
{y:i}Right side to the bed.

409
00:39:01,841 --> 00:39:05,136
{y:i}We call this
{y:i}the nurturing position.

410
00:40:00,566 --> 00:40:03,695
Come on in, Joseph.
Go into the room on your left...

411
00:40:03,778 --> 00:40:06,239
and take off all your clothes
except your shorts.

412
00:41:11,095 --> 00:41:13,056
Naw, forget it.

413
00:41:20,104 --> 00:41:22,065
Come and stand over here.

414
00:41:23,107 --> 00:41:27,153
I want you to look in the mirror
and tell me what you see.

415
00:41:27,236 --> 00:41:29,822
Tell me about your body.

416
00:41:29,906 --> 00:41:31,991
You're jokin', right?

417
00:41:32,742 --> 00:41:36,704
Okay then.
Is this as far as we go?

418
00:41:45,004 --> 00:41:47,048
I guess I'm a bit too thin.

419
00:41:49,968 --> 00:41:51,928
My legs are
definitely too skinny.

420
00:41:55,890 --> 00:41:58,518
I don't know.
It's fine. Why?

421
00:41:58,601 --> 00:42:02,105
Well, you stand as if
you don't like your body.

422
00:42:02,188 --> 00:42:04,148
I like your body.

423
00:42:04,232 --> 00:42:06,234
It's lean...

424
00:42:06,317 --> 00:42:07,819
strong.

425
00:42:10,154 --> 00:42:12,740
Capable hands,
well-defined feet.

426
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:15,660
Of course, you could
change it if you wanted...

427
00:42:15,702 --> 00:42:18,204
but it's better to change
how you feel about it.

428
00:42:21,082 --> 00:42:23,334
Anyone that doesn't
totally accept their body...

429
00:42:23,418 --> 00:42:25,420
can never experience ecstasy...

430
00:42:26,796 --> 00:42:30,258
can never enable another
to experience it.

431
00:42:31,843 --> 00:42:34,262
What do you think
about your penis?

432
00:42:38,766 --> 00:42:40,768
Well, to be honest, I like it.

433
00:42:40,852 --> 00:42:43,521
It's... large and powerful.

434
00:42:43,605 --> 00:42:46,399
Good. I want you
to feel that way.

435
00:42:46,482 --> 00:42:48,735
I'm sure it's true.

436
00:42:48,818 --> 00:42:50,820
Later on, I can
give you some exercises...

437
00:42:50,903 --> 00:42:53,364
to further increase its size.

438
00:42:53,448 --> 00:42:55,450
Good for you.
Good for Maria.

439
00:42:56,659 --> 00:43:00,121
Now, every night
before you go to sleep...

440
00:43:01,372 --> 00:43:03,791
{y:i}I want you to practice
{y:i}what I call...

441
00:43:03,875 --> 00:43:06,210
"the bliss" carezza."

442
00:43:09,047 --> 00:43:11,674
{y:i}Barely touching Maria...

443
00:43:11,758 --> 00:43:15,720
{y:i}tenderly stroke her body
{y:i}from head to toe with your hand.

444
00:43:19,849 --> 00:43:21,935
{y:i}We are sensitizing her body...

445
00:43:24,312 --> 00:43:26,898
{y:i}awakening her ecstatic responses.

446
00:43:30,151 --> 00:43:33,196
{y:i}Then, her hand on you.

447
00:43:38,451 --> 00:43:40,495
{y:i}Imagine life energy...

448
00:43:40,578 --> 00:43:42,956
{y:i}flowing through her hands.

449
00:43:49,462 --> 00:43:51,422
{y:i}Feel the electricity.

450
00:44:11,317 --> 00:44:13,403
{y:i}I promised Joseph
{y:i}I wouldn't come here.

451
00:44:16,990 --> 00:44:18,950
I don't want to hurt him...

452
00:44:19,909 --> 00:44:21,411
or us.

453
00:44:25,790 --> 00:44:27,250
It's just...

454
00:44:28,835 --> 00:44:30,837
Sometimes, I get scared.

455
00:44:41,014 --> 00:44:43,016
Would you like to dance?

456
00:44:47,437 --> 00:44:49,981
I always wanted to be
a ballroom dancer...

457
00:44:50,064 --> 00:44:53,818
you know, the kind
that dons a tux every night and...

458
00:44:53,901 --> 00:44:55,903
dances the world.

459
00:45:33,191 --> 00:45:35,151
Did you enjoy the dance?

460
00:45:37,070 --> 00:45:39,030
Yes.

461
00:45:39,113 --> 00:45:41,324
As did I.

462
00:45:41,407 --> 00:45:43,368
Very much.

463
00:45:44,077 --> 00:45:46,412
And if you enjoy the dance, Maria...

464
00:45:48,790 --> 00:45:51,709
Then the dance is enough.

465
00:45:53,962 --> 00:45:55,463
I promise.

466
00:45:57,674 --> 00:46:00,176
Have a cigar.
They're very mild.

467
00:46:00,260 --> 00:46:02,262
- Oh, no. No, thank you.
- Have one anyway.

468
00:46:18,361 --> 00:46:20,989
Most men fear
women's power, Joseph.

469
00:46:22,532 --> 00:46:26,703
A sexually conscious woman
is as powerful as any being on the planet.

470
00:46:28,288 --> 00:46:30,873
We are entering a new era.

471
00:46:30,957 --> 00:46:33,585
It will be the resurgence
of the divine feminine spirit.

472
00:46:34,961 --> 00:46:36,921
We must honor that spirit...

473
00:46:37,005 --> 00:46:39,382
in ourselves...

474
00:46:39,465 --> 00:46:41,426
and in others.

475
00:46:43,469 --> 00:46:45,763
You have to suck on it
once in a while.

476
00:46:45,805 --> 00:46:47,807
Otherwise, it goes out.

477
00:47:02,363 --> 00:47:05,700
The goal of sex
is not orgasm, Joseph...

478
00:47:05,783 --> 00:47:07,744
but ecstasy.

479
00:47:09,370 --> 00:47:12,749
Maria's satisfaction
will give you ecstasy.

480
00:47:12,832 --> 00:47:14,292
Nothing else.

481
00:47:16,502 --> 00:47:19,631
There are nine levels...
movements, I call them...

482
00:47:19,714 --> 00:47:21,841
to a woman's orgasm.

483
00:47:21,925 --> 00:47:26,137
Now, most lovers
only achieve level four...

484
00:47:26,220 --> 00:47:28,640
the ultimate release...

485
00:47:28,723 --> 00:47:30,808
but it's just the threshold.

486
00:47:30,892 --> 00:47:33,603
Between movements five and nine...

487
00:47:33,686 --> 00:47:35,813
is where true healing occurs.

488
00:47:37,315 --> 00:47:39,776
To reach these movements...

489
00:47:39,859 --> 00:47:42,987
you must practice with diligence
the exercises I give you.

490
00:47:43,071 --> 00:47:45,073
One of their purposes...

491
00:47:45,156 --> 00:47:48,785
is to make orgasm
and ejaculation a voluntary act.

492
00:47:48,868 --> 00:47:50,828
I thought
they were the same thing.

493
00:47:50,912 --> 00:47:52,914
Most people do.

494
00:47:52,997 --> 00:47:56,251
In truth, both orgasm and ejaculation
are governed...

495
00:47:56,334 --> 00:47:59,504
by different
neurological mechanisms.

496
00:48:01,631 --> 00:48:04,842
You must learn to separate
and control each at will.

497
00:48:06,886 --> 00:48:08,888
What do you mean?

498
00:48:08,972 --> 00:48:11,599
The only way to really satisfy
a woman and yourself...

499
00:48:11,683 --> 00:48:14,227
is to have control...

500
00:48:14,310 --> 00:48:17,355
complete control
over your ejaculation.

501
00:48:20,024 --> 00:48:22,986
Then you are no longer
led around by your penis.

502
00:48:25,113 --> 00:48:28,116
This has far-reaching implications
in all areas of life...

503
00:48:28,199 --> 00:48:30,159
don't you think?

504
00:48:34,872 --> 00:48:38,835
Well, sir, are you saying that
I'm never supposed to come?

505
00:48:38,918 --> 00:48:40,878
When you choose.

506
00:48:41,588 --> 00:48:44,299
That way, you don't
dissipate your life force.

507
00:48:44,382 --> 00:48:47,218
Don't you feel tired
after you've made love?

508
00:48:49,762 --> 00:48:52,390
I will teach you
how to "injaculate..."

509
00:48:53,850 --> 00:48:57,437
so you can have many orgasms
without losing your power.

510
00:48:58,605 --> 00:49:01,649
Yes, I will teach you and Maria...

511
00:49:01,733 --> 00:49:04,527
a greater pleasure
than you imagine possible.

512
00:49:06,154 --> 00:49:08,489
Go on. Let's see how you do.

513
00:49:29,260 --> 00:49:31,554
I can go a lot further.

514
00:49:31,638 --> 00:49:35,058
I just got
some lungs in my water.

515
00:49:39,687 --> 00:49:43,858
Okay, using your left hand,
close your left nostril...

516
00:49:43,942 --> 00:49:47,403
and breathe in through your right nostril
to a count of seven.

517
00:49:48,488 --> 00:49:50,782
Then close both nostrils...

518
00:49:50,865 --> 00:49:53,576
and hold for a count of 14.

519
00:49:53,660 --> 00:49:55,620
Open the left nostril...

520
00:49:55,703 --> 00:49:58,456
and breathe out
through a count of seven.

521
00:49:58,498 --> 00:50:00,875
Close the right nostril...

522
00:50:00,959 --> 00:50:03,962
and hold for a count of 14.

523
00:50:04,045 --> 00:50:06,589
Keeping the left nostril open...

524
00:50:06,673 --> 00:50:09,592
breathe in to a count of seven.

525
00:50:09,676 --> 00:50:11,636
Close both nostrils...

526
00:50:12,512 --> 00:50:16,057
Two, three, four, five.

527
00:50:18,101 --> 00:50:20,103
Why would anybody
wanna do this?

528
00:50:24,899 --> 00:50:27,151
Okay, Joseph,
I'm ready to come down.

529
00:50:30,405 --> 00:50:32,407
Joseph, come on.

530
00:50:37,245 --> 00:50:39,247
No sex without condoms.

531
00:50:39,330 --> 00:50:41,291
No booze, no drugs.

532
00:50:41,374 --> 00:50:43,376
Now you tell me
I can't even come?

533
00:50:45,336 --> 00:50:47,297
I know.
It's depressing, isn't it?

534
00:50:47,380 --> 00:50:48,881
Boy!

535
00:50:55,638 --> 00:50:57,140
- Hey.
- Hey.

536
00:50:57,223 --> 00:50:59,183
I just have to run an errand.
I'll be right back.

537
00:50:59,267 --> 00:51:01,269
- Okay.
- Done your exercises?

538
00:51:02,395 --> 00:51:05,148
Well, I tried, but...

539
00:51:05,231 --> 00:51:07,191
I don't know.
I just can't do it.

540
00:51:07,275 --> 00:51:10,445
I can't just think of myself.
I need to fantasize.

541
00:51:11,738 --> 00:51:15,199
Go to the white room, Joseph.
Try again.

542
00:51:15,283 --> 00:51:18,036
Concentrate
on your own sexual power.

543
00:51:18,077 --> 00:51:20,079
Don't throw it away on fantasy.

544
00:51:21,914 --> 00:51:24,876
You don't want me
to take you through them, do you?

545
00:52:16,052 --> 00:52:18,054
{y:i}Maria remains a mystery.

546
00:52:19,305 --> 00:52:23,351
{y:i}It's hard for me to determine the roots
{y:i}ofher sexual dysfunction...

547
00:52:23,434 --> 00:52:26,604
{y:i}or the extent
{y:i}ofher childhood trauma.

548
00:52:26,646 --> 00:52:29,899
{y:i}There have, to date,
{y:i}been no repressed-memory flashes...

549
00:52:29,983 --> 00:52:32,026
{y:i}or nightmares...

550
00:52:32,110 --> 00:52:36,281
{y:i}yet she lives in a constant state
{y:i}of suppressed paranoia.

551
00:52:39,075 --> 00:52:41,786
{y:i}Maria is oddly protective
{y:i}ofJoseph.

552
00:52:43,204 --> 00:52:45,540
{y:i}He seems to be a good person...

553
00:52:45,623 --> 00:52:47,917
{y:i}captured by Maria's
{y:i}intense passion...

554
00:52:48,001 --> 00:52:51,921
{y:i}which often springs forth
{y:i}to surprise me at any moment...

555
00:52:52,005 --> 00:52:55,383
{y:i}captured by her beauty
{y:i}and seductive charms...

556
00:52:55,466 --> 00:52:59,053
{y:i}and, most likely, captured
{y:i}by his own need...

557
00:52:59,137 --> 00:53:03,141
{y:i}to suck love from those who are
{y:i}too wounded to give it freely.

558
00:53:06,853 --> 00:53:08,855
{y:i}I know this man.

559
00:53:24,287 --> 00:53:25,580
Finally.

560
00:53:25,663 --> 00:53:29,500
{y:i}Hera:
{y:i}Trials of the Goddess Obscura.

561
00:53:29,584 --> 00:53:32,670
First published in 1908.

562
00:53:32,754 --> 00:53:35,089
It's been out of print
since 1932.

563
00:53:36,257 --> 00:53:38,718
You have yet
to let me down, Eva.

564
00:53:40,094 --> 00:53:43,348
I find the combination
of charm and intelligence...

565
00:53:44,599 --> 00:53:47,268
a rare union these days.

566
00:53:54,067 --> 00:53:56,444
{y:i}Maria will take time.

567
00:53:56,527 --> 00:54:00,198
{y:i}She is in the darkness
{y:i}before self-realization.

568
00:54:00,281 --> 00:54:02,283
{y:i}She needs to feel free...

569
00:54:02,367 --> 00:54:05,370
{y:i}to express herself in ways
{y:i}she cannot with her husband.

570
00:54:05,453 --> 00:54:07,455
{y:i}She needs to be released
{y:i}from the burdens...

571
00:54:07,538 --> 00:54:09,582
{y:i}ofher shame and self-hatred.

572
00:54:10,792 --> 00:54:12,794
I will try.

573
00:54:21,094 --> 00:54:23,388
How are the exercises going?

574
00:54:26,099 --> 00:54:27,600
Fine.

575
00:54:28,726 --> 00:54:30,687
Everything's going fine.

576
00:54:30,770 --> 00:54:32,814
I want you to do them
three times a day.

577
00:54:33,731 --> 00:54:35,692
Draw the energy
up to the heart chakra...

578
00:54:35,775 --> 00:54:38,611
and then progress to the third eye,
as we discussed.

579
00:54:40,029 --> 00:54:42,448
I work all day.

580
00:54:43,616 --> 00:54:45,576
Then I suggest you close your door.

581
00:54:47,704 --> 00:54:49,706
Can you explain it to me?

582
00:54:50,790 --> 00:54:54,711
Well, Joseph, you know,
the construction supervisor...

583
00:54:54,794 --> 00:54:58,715
is talking about chakras,
reads books about Hinduism.

584
00:54:58,798 --> 00:55:01,175
MyJoseph
is talking about chakras.

585
00:55:01,259 --> 00:55:03,386
I think thatJoseph's discovery
that his relationship with you...

586
00:55:03,428 --> 00:55:06,264
is not what he thought it was
has had a profound effect on him.

587
00:55:06,347 --> 00:55:09,809
It's like... he has this inner life
that I...

588
00:55:13,688 --> 00:55:15,189
What?

589
00:55:16,482 --> 00:55:18,484
Nothing.

590
00:55:18,568 --> 00:55:20,945
I just had a bizarre thought.

591
00:55:25,283 --> 00:55:27,493
Anyway...

592
00:55:27,577 --> 00:55:29,954
last night, we just...

593
00:55:30,038 --> 00:55:33,541
sat in bed and talked...

594
00:55:33,625 --> 00:55:35,585
sort of.

595
00:55:36,419 --> 00:55:38,129
Tell me.

596
00:55:38,171 --> 00:55:40,298
I can't. I can't.

597
00:55:44,802 --> 00:55:46,262
Okay.

598
00:55:49,474 --> 00:55:51,476
He sat me down
in front of a mirror...

599
00:55:51,559 --> 00:55:53,645
and he asked me
to masturbate for him.

600
00:55:55,355 --> 00:55:58,107
He wanted me to show him
step-by-step...

601
00:55:58,191 --> 00:56:00,151
how I like to be touched.

602
00:56:01,694 --> 00:56:03,655
He wanted to know
how to please me.

603
00:56:05,782 --> 00:56:07,784
How did that feel?

604
00:56:07,867 --> 00:56:10,411
I wouldn't do it at first.
I was too embarrassed.

605
00:56:12,246 --> 00:56:14,248
Then he did it.

606
00:56:16,167 --> 00:56:20,713
I learned so much about him
by watching him...

607
00:56:23,007 --> 00:56:24,968
how he touched himself.

608
00:56:27,887 --> 00:56:29,847
Then I did it.

609
00:56:32,350 --> 00:56:34,852
Do you feel you got closer
to an orgasm?

610
00:56:35,603 --> 00:56:39,107
Oh, God, no!
I was far too self-conscious.

611
00:56:39,190 --> 00:56:41,150
But this is good.

612
00:56:44,362 --> 00:56:46,572
Before we end, though, Maria,
I would like to encourage you...

613
00:56:46,656 --> 00:56:48,658
to return to therapy
with a greater commitment.

614
00:56:48,741 --> 00:56:50,743
I don't know.

615
00:56:52,912 --> 00:56:55,623
I worry too much
when I see you.

616
00:56:55,707 --> 00:56:59,544
- I try to control my thoughts.
- We are what we think, Maria.

617
00:56:59,586 --> 00:57:02,922
Life is learning to come to terms
with our thoughts.

618
00:57:03,006 --> 00:57:06,009
The terms of my thoughts
are unreasonable, Alfred.

619
00:57:08,303 --> 00:57:10,471
It's just as well
I leave them alone.

620
00:57:12,307 --> 00:57:12,432
Start by using
your ring finger.

621
00:57:12,432 --> 00:57:15,893
Start by using
your ring finger.

622
00:57:15,935 --> 00:57:19,063
Slip it in gently
and curl it...

623
00:57:19,147 --> 00:57:23,109
so your fingertip is touching
the ceiling of the yoni.

624
00:57:23,192 --> 00:57:25,236
Go as deep as you can.

625
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:27,947
Then slide your finger down
until you feel it.

626
00:57:30,617 --> 00:57:33,953
- How will I know?
- Most likely, she'll tell you.

627
00:57:34,037 --> 00:57:36,039
She'll feel it if you don't.

628
00:57:37,749 --> 00:57:40,168
When you find the sacred spot...

629
00:57:40,251 --> 00:57:42,462
never break eye contact
with Maria.

630
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:49,802
Does it hurt?

631
00:57:50,803 --> 00:57:53,765
- It's just sensitive.
- Is it too much?

632
00:57:56,935 --> 00:57:58,895
It feels raw...

633
00:58:00,188 --> 00:58:02,190
almost like it's burning.

634
00:58:06,486 --> 00:58:09,447
The first few times
the sacred spot is touched...

635
00:58:10,823 --> 00:58:12,825
it can be frightening.

636
00:58:12,909 --> 00:58:15,119
She may experience pain.

637
00:58:15,203 --> 00:58:17,789
I'm scared, Joseph.

638
00:58:17,872 --> 00:58:19,374
It's okay.

639
00:58:19,457 --> 00:58:21,751
Just keep stroking.

640
00:58:21,793 --> 00:58:24,629
The sensation will change.

641
00:58:31,552 --> 00:58:34,180
Stay with me, okay?

642
00:58:34,264 --> 00:58:37,141
- I love you.
- I love you too.

643
00:58:46,734 --> 00:58:50,530
Stay with her for only
30 seconds or so...

644
00:58:50,613 --> 00:58:52,824
and then slowly withdraw...

645
00:58:52,907 --> 00:58:55,535
but hold her very closely.

646
00:58:56,452 --> 00:59:00,540
You are assuming the role of healer
in this act, Joseph.

647
00:59:01,749 --> 00:59:04,794
All Maria's abuse
and psychic hurts...

648
00:59:04,877 --> 00:59:07,005
reside in this sacred spot.

649
00:59:08,006 --> 00:59:09,966
It will take time
to release them.

650
01:00:49,774 --> 01:00:51,734
A bit late,
aren't you, Joseph?

651
01:00:53,486 --> 01:00:56,155
I feel it, you know,
what you've been talking about.

652
01:00:56,239 --> 01:00:59,242
I've been doing the exercises,
and I feel it.

653
01:01:00,868 --> 01:01:02,870
Describe this feeling.

654
01:01:05,039 --> 01:01:07,875
It's like this, you know, this sadness
that I've been carrying around...

655
01:01:07,959 --> 01:01:10,044
has just, you know...
It's lifted.

656
01:01:10,128 --> 01:01:13,047
And I feel...
I just feel the love.

657
01:01:13,131 --> 01:01:16,301
I feel in love with myself.

658
01:01:28,229 --> 01:01:31,816
So, what's on for today?

659
01:01:31,899 --> 01:01:34,360
Nothing's on for today, Joseph.

660
01:01:34,444 --> 01:01:36,446
I have a very busy evening...

661
01:01:36,529 --> 01:01:39,157
a performance and a date.

662
01:01:39,949 --> 01:01:41,659
You have a date?

663
01:01:42,493 --> 01:01:43,953
Indeed.

664
01:01:44,037 --> 01:01:45,913
And so do you.

665
01:01:46,664 --> 01:01:48,625
It's time for you and Maria
to make love.

666
01:01:54,213 --> 01:01:56,341
Now remember...

667
01:01:56,424 --> 01:01:58,551
make love from the heart...

668
01:01:58,635 --> 01:02:00,637
nowhere else.

669
01:02:00,720 --> 01:02:02,180
Keep your eyes open...

670
01:02:02,764 --> 01:02:04,849
move extremely slowly...

671
01:02:04,933 --> 01:02:06,976
and, most importantly...

672
01:02:08,061 --> 01:02:11,773
with love and adoration.

673
01:02:13,733 --> 01:02:16,361
What about
the nine levels of orgasm?

674
01:02:16,444 --> 01:02:19,614
Later. Don't concern yourself
with orgasm.

675
01:02:19,697 --> 01:02:23,076
For Maria, it will take much time.

676
01:02:23,159 --> 01:02:25,536
For you, it's forbidden.

677
01:02:36,047 --> 01:02:38,049
I feel the love.

678
01:02:40,426 --> 01:02:42,762
I love myself.

679
01:02:42,845 --> 01:02:44,973
- I love myself.
- Congratulations, buddy.

680
01:02:48,017 --> 01:02:50,144
I love myself three times a day.

681
01:02:50,228 --> 01:02:52,188
I feel the love.

682
01:03:14,085 --> 01:03:16,754
Okay. I'll talk to you later.
Bye.

683
01:03:37,233 --> 01:03:40,737
- Hello.
- What's so funny?

684
01:03:42,614 --> 01:03:44,657
How did you know
I was laughing?

685
01:03:47,452 --> 01:03:49,912
I just know.

686
01:03:49,954 --> 01:03:52,123
I've been learning more...

687
01:03:52,206 --> 01:03:54,626
and more about you
every day.

688
01:03:56,794 --> 01:03:58,755
So I see.

689
01:04:00,298 --> 01:04:03,051
- When are you coming home?
- Soon.

690
01:04:03,885 --> 01:04:05,929
When I do...

691
01:04:05,970 --> 01:04:07,972
do you wanna make love?

692
01:04:13,144 --> 01:04:15,229
I thought
you wanted to wait.

693
01:04:17,815 --> 01:04:20,985
I mean,
are you sure you're ready?

694
01:04:27,909 --> 01:04:29,911
Under one condition.

695
01:04:32,538 --> 01:04:34,040
What's that?

696
01:04:35,041 --> 01:04:37,043
We do it my way.

697
01:04:40,338 --> 01:04:43,424
Hon, maybe we should just, you know,
hold each other first.

698
01:04:43,508 --> 01:04:44,968
Shut up.

699
01:05:01,192 --> 01:05:03,861
Why are you doing this?

700
01:05:03,945 --> 01:05:05,947
'Cause I love your toes...

701
01:05:07,365 --> 01:05:09,325
and it excites me.

702
01:05:24,090 --> 01:05:25,592
Don't move.

703
01:05:35,768 --> 01:05:37,687
- Hon!
- Huh?

704
01:05:47,405 --> 01:05:48,906
It hurts.

705
01:06:27,403 --> 01:06:29,906
I love you
so deep inside me, Joseph.

706
01:06:32,825 --> 01:06:36,454
Oh, God, I feel you so...
so deep inside.

707
01:06:45,255 --> 01:06:47,257
Not so fast.

708
01:06:49,509 --> 01:06:51,594
- I'm not supposed to come.
- Huh?

709
01:06:51,636 --> 01:06:53,054
- I'm not supposed to...
- What?

710
01:06:53,137 --> 01:06:55,306
- I'm not supposed to...
- I can't hear you.

711
01:06:55,348 --> 01:06:57,350
- Don't make me come.
- Why?

712
01:07:03,106 --> 01:07:05,566
Too bad, motherfucker.

713
01:07:33,469 --> 01:07:35,471
Did you like it?

714
01:07:36,681 --> 01:07:39,225
I guess she surprised us, huh?

715
01:07:39,309 --> 01:07:41,311
Yeah.

716
01:07:41,352 --> 01:07:43,354
I felt...

717
01:07:43,438 --> 01:07:44,939
Scared?

718
01:07:46,482 --> 01:07:49,986
A woman's anger
can be very scary.

719
01:07:50,069 --> 01:07:52,864
Most don't feel they have
the right to express it.

720
01:07:54,449 --> 01:07:58,620
Maybe we should encourage Maria
to vent hers more often.

721
01:07:58,703 --> 01:08:00,830
- In bed?
- Why not?

722
01:08:03,791 --> 01:08:06,461
Repressed anger...

723
01:08:06,544 --> 01:08:09,380
chokes us, closes us down.

724
01:08:14,344 --> 01:08:17,555
Are you sure it was
Maria's anger that scared you?

725
01:08:17,639 --> 01:08:19,682
What do you mean?

726
01:08:19,724 --> 01:08:21,726
How did it feel
to be fucked?

727
01:08:23,353 --> 01:08:25,813
Out of control.

728
01:08:25,897 --> 01:08:27,857
How did you feel?

729
01:08:31,444 --> 01:08:32,946
Fear.

730
01:08:44,582 --> 01:08:47,168
I was over on Hinton Street
the other day.

731
01:09:03,226 --> 01:09:05,228
Does he make you feel safe?

732
01:09:15,989 --> 01:09:17,991
Does he love you no matter what?

733
01:09:24,455 --> 01:09:26,416
So do I.

734
01:09:33,673 --> 01:09:35,174
Follow closely.

735
01:09:37,010 --> 01:09:39,012
Let me into your subconscious.

736
01:10:06,497 --> 01:10:08,458
Touch her like a harmonic...

737
01:10:08,541 --> 01:10:10,543
gently, yin...

738
01:10:19,010 --> 01:10:21,471
but sure, definitive.

739
01:10:32,815 --> 01:10:34,817
It's nice, huh?

740
01:11:02,011 --> 01:11:04,013
Look at me.

741
01:11:05,390 --> 01:11:06,849
Look at me.

742
01:13:01,172 --> 01:13:04,300
"Now movements" f"ive to nine."

743
01:13:05,593 --> 01:13:07,845
{y:i}Support her neck
{y:i}with your hand...

744
01:13:07,887 --> 01:13:11,224
{y:i}precisely at the fourth and fifth
"ce"rv"ical vertebrae."

745
01:13:13,559 --> 01:13:16,646
{y:i}Begin your toning
{y:i}and breathe into her neck...

746
01:13:16,688 --> 01:13:18,690
{y:i}through your hand.

747
01:13:20,233 --> 01:13:23,194
{y:i}Energy follows consciousness.

748
01:13:45,258 --> 01:13:47,260
Are you okay?

749
01:13:47,343 --> 01:13:49,804
Hon? Hon!

750
01:13:53,141 --> 01:13:54,642
Honey?

751
01:14:52,659 --> 01:14:54,661
Yes, I'm Joseph.

752
01:14:55,954 --> 01:14:59,666
- Do you mind if my friends...
- Anyone you want.

753
01:15:01,042 --> 01:15:04,963
Okay. When Maria
first arrived...

754
01:15:05,046 --> 01:15:07,632
her throat
was almost swollen shut.

755
01:15:07,715 --> 01:15:10,593
We injected the throat
with a strong anti-inflammatory.

756
01:15:10,635 --> 01:15:13,471
We also administered her a sedative
so she would rest.

757
01:15:15,682 --> 01:15:17,725
Now, to your knowledge...

758
01:15:17,809 --> 01:15:20,979
has anything like this
ever happened before?

759
01:15:21,020 --> 01:15:23,022
Is she allergic to anything?

760
01:15:23,106 --> 01:15:25,900
- Any medication she might have taken?
- Not that I know of.

761
01:15:25,984 --> 01:15:29,487
What were you doing
when this occurred?

762
01:15:32,991 --> 01:15:35,034
We were making love...

763
01:15:36,327 --> 01:15:38,538
and she started crying...

764
01:15:39,497 --> 01:15:41,833
and then she started choking.

765
01:15:41,874 --> 01:15:44,669
She's been under a lot
of abnormal stress lately.

766
01:15:46,004 --> 01:15:48,381
She had a severe breakdown.

767
01:15:48,464 --> 01:15:50,675
She had a body memory.

768
01:15:50,717 --> 01:15:54,387
Maria has endured some form
of repeated child abuse.

769
01:15:54,470 --> 01:15:56,723
She shows almost all
the external symptoms...

770
01:15:56,806 --> 01:15:58,808
but it's locked
in her subconscious.

771
01:16:00,143 --> 01:16:02,604
Now she can begin
the road to recovery.

772
01:16:02,687 --> 01:16:04,647
That's possible.

773
01:16:04,731 --> 01:16:08,318
Her memory could've triggered
a spontaneous regression to some incident.

774
01:16:08,359 --> 01:16:11,863
Oral sex is one of the most common
forms of infant abuse.

775
01:17:15,510 --> 01:17:19,639
It's more about acceptance
than forgiveness for me.

776
01:17:21,307 --> 01:17:23,309
I got a letter a year later.

777
01:17:24,686 --> 01:17:27,063
Now she denies
that anything ever happened.

778
01:17:29,732 --> 01:17:31,234
That's all.

779
01:17:42,161 --> 01:17:44,622
My name is Maria...

780
01:17:44,706 --> 01:17:49,419
and I'm a survivor
of child sexual abuse and incest.

781
01:17:54,882 --> 01:17:56,384
- Hey.
- Hi.

782
01:17:56,467 --> 01:17:58,428
It's Maria's mother on the phone.

783
01:18:06,352 --> 01:18:08,354
{y:i}Hello, Dottie?

784
01:18:13,151 --> 01:18:17,113
I support her, and I am doing
as best as I can...

785
01:18:17,196 --> 01:18:19,324
as her husband
in this situation...

786
01:18:19,407 --> 01:18:21,784
but does it really matter
what I think?

787
01:18:23,536 --> 01:18:26,748
I realize that you think she's ill.
She is getting help.

788
01:18:35,256 --> 01:18:37,300
Because I've seen her suffer.

789
01:18:39,177 --> 01:18:41,137
Well, I'm sorry, too, Dottie.

790
01:19:00,531 --> 01:19:02,867
- Honey, it's the fifth time today you've taken...
- Leave me alone.

791
01:19:04,077 --> 01:19:06,120
We have to talk
about this, Maria.

792
01:19:07,538 --> 01:19:09,540
I just needed a shower.

793
01:19:19,509 --> 01:19:23,554
The other night, when you got up
to go to the bathroom...

794
01:19:23,638 --> 01:19:25,974
I knew it was you...

795
01:19:26,057 --> 01:19:29,769
but what I saw was him
standing there...

796
01:19:32,230 --> 01:19:34,565
naked...

797
01:19:34,607 --> 01:19:36,609
ready to come to my bed.

798
01:19:38,611 --> 01:19:42,699
We need to separate, Joseph.
I know I'm going crazy.

799
01:19:42,782 --> 01:19:45,410
You have to let me inside.

800
01:19:45,493 --> 01:19:47,495
You have to let me
try to help you.

801
01:19:47,578 --> 01:19:49,622
I don't feel comfortable
around you.

802
01:19:49,706 --> 01:19:52,875
- The things that you do frighten me.
- Just tell me what I can do.

803
01:19:52,917 --> 01:19:55,878
When you touch me,
I feel numb.

804
01:20:02,552 --> 01:20:06,556
I'm gonna sleep in the guest bedroom
until you find another place to stay.

805
01:20:26,284 --> 01:20:30,079
Living room, bar, kitchen...
if you wanna call it that.

806
01:20:30,121 --> 01:20:31,623
Closets.

807
01:20:31,706 --> 01:20:35,168
Clean towels, fresh linens
every other day.

808
01:20:35,251 --> 01:20:36,753
Any questions?

809
01:21:05,031 --> 01:21:07,909
Not your most confident stride,
Joseph.

810
01:21:16,042 --> 01:21:18,086
Maria asked you to leave.

811
01:21:21,756 --> 01:21:24,175
Listen, if you know everything
that's gonna happen in my life...

812
01:21:24,259 --> 01:21:26,094
for the next two years,
why don't you let me know...

813
01:21:26,177 --> 01:21:29,097
so I can plan my vacations and know
when to put my house on the market.

814
01:21:31,266 --> 01:21:33,559
Tell me what happened.

815
01:21:48,700 --> 01:21:50,785
It's what Maria's going through.

816
01:21:53,037 --> 01:21:56,207
What has to do with you...

817
01:21:56,291 --> 01:21:58,585
has to do with you.

818
01:22:03,381 --> 01:22:05,383
What's that supposed to mean?

819
01:22:06,926 --> 01:22:10,513
You married a scarred and
emotionally dysfunctional woman.

820
01:22:11,723 --> 01:22:14,559
Has it ever occurred to you
to ask yourself why?

821
01:22:14,601 --> 01:22:18,479
Why you put up with so much
in return for so little?

822
01:22:18,563 --> 01:22:21,399
Because I'm in love
with her, okay?

823
01:22:21,482 --> 01:22:25,528
And because I believed in you.
I believed that we could help her!

824
01:22:25,570 --> 01:22:29,741
Our relationship has never
been about Maria. Never.

825
01:22:29,824 --> 01:22:33,745
You don't love Maria, Joseph.
You want to mold her.

826
01:22:33,786 --> 01:22:36,164
You want to make her
something forJoseph.

827
01:22:36,247 --> 01:22:38,666
And you've only ever
proven to me...

828
01:22:38,750 --> 01:22:40,710
that you'd do anything
to make that happen.

829
01:22:40,752 --> 01:22:43,212
What do you know
about love? Huh?

830
01:22:46,257 --> 01:22:49,177
Love is being there when
they hate your fucking guts!

831
01:22:49,260 --> 01:22:51,095
Love is being there
when they bleed.

832
01:22:52,805 --> 01:22:56,517
Have you ever been with a woman
for more than one hour? Ever?

833
01:23:08,988 --> 01:23:13,076
Wendy takes small steps every day
to make herself attractive.

834
01:23:13,117 --> 01:23:16,788
She eats. Then she eliminates
through the esophagus, mind you.

835
01:23:16,871 --> 01:23:19,540
That's when she's not taking
the latest laxative on the market.

836
01:23:21,251 --> 01:23:23,169
A beautiful woman, Leslie.

837
01:23:23,253 --> 01:23:28,132
God made her 5'5"
and a voluptuous 128 pounds.

838
01:23:28,216 --> 01:23:30,718
But sometime, probably
when she was a teenager...

839
01:23:30,802 --> 01:23:33,263
she got the idea that
she wasn't so beautiful.

840
01:23:33,346 --> 01:23:35,556
Maybe it was because her friends,
Debbie and Connie...

841
01:23:35,640 --> 01:23:37,558
were getting all the boys.

842
01:23:37,642 --> 01:23:40,228
But she started a program
of repetitive surgery...

843
01:23:40,311 --> 01:23:42,647
to suck all the fat
from her body.

844
01:23:42,689 --> 01:23:45,775
She started with her hips,
her thighs, her tummy.

845
01:23:45,817 --> 01:23:48,861
Next month, unless
we do something to help her...

846
01:23:48,945 --> 01:23:50,947
she'll continue with
her arms and her ankles.

847
01:23:51,030 --> 01:23:52,532
They always do.

848
01:23:53,408 --> 01:23:58,204
Candy's had four implants.
She just can't get it quite right.

849
01:23:59,914 --> 01:24:03,668
Evelyn injects her face
with cow fat six times a year.

850
01:24:04,711 --> 01:24:07,380
Jane: Two hours
on the StairMaster...

851
01:24:07,463 --> 01:24:09,924
an hour on a treadmill, daily.

852
01:24:11,968 --> 01:24:15,722
They dress to flaunt this,
to hide that.

853
01:24:15,805 --> 01:24:18,182
They cover their faces
with poisons.

854
01:24:18,224 --> 01:24:22,812
You're right. They do bleed, Joseph.
And do you know why?

855
01:24:24,230 --> 01:24:28,318
Because they're desperate
to sell what men buy.

856
01:24:28,359 --> 01:24:32,447
Desperate to be what
they're not, to be loved.

857
01:24:32,530 --> 01:24:34,157
Like Maria.

858
01:24:35,950 --> 01:24:40,830
Have you ever thought
that maybe your focus on Maria...

859
01:24:40,872 --> 01:24:44,626
is a distraction from
your own fear of abandonment?

860
01:24:46,753 --> 01:24:50,298
Your own emptiness?
Your own life?

861
01:24:52,884 --> 01:24:56,346
You want to be a healer?
Heal yourself.

862
01:25:18,576 --> 01:25:21,245
This'll be painless.
I promise.

863
01:25:21,329 --> 01:25:25,041
- You're a deceptive asshole.
- All you gotta do is meet her.

864
01:25:25,083 --> 01:25:27,794
She just got divorced.
She was married for two years.

865
01:25:27,877 --> 01:25:29,879
You guys got a lot in common.

866
01:25:30,880 --> 01:25:33,925
Now she's
a little bit flat upstairs...

867
01:25:34,008 --> 01:25:36,469
but Nancy tells me
she has a bodacious ass...

868
01:25:36,552 --> 01:25:38,554
and is not afraid to use it.

869
01:25:40,014 --> 01:25:43,559
Tanner, do me a favor, okay?

870
01:25:43,643 --> 01:25:45,937
Never talk to me about a woman
like that again.

871
01:25:48,940 --> 01:25:50,900
What is wrong with you?

872
01:26:07,250 --> 01:26:09,168
{y:i}Joseph, are you with me?

873
01:26:09,252 --> 01:26:12,088
Hmm? Yeah. Sorry.

874
01:26:13,131 --> 01:26:15,967
Okay. Arthur wants you to take
a meeting with the Kensor group.

875
01:26:16,009 --> 01:26:17,552
Will you do it?

876
01:26:18,803 --> 01:26:20,763
No. You know what?

877
01:26:20,847 --> 01:26:23,516
Cancel my 2:30 meeting
with Cruise, too, would you?

878
01:26:24,559 --> 01:26:27,061
- Where you going?
- Goin' out for a while.

879
01:27:14,776 --> 01:27:16,277
Hello?

880
01:27:18,529 --> 01:27:20,490
Yes, Doctor.

881
01:27:22,033 --> 01:27:24,118
No. No, I'll be there.

882
01:27:25,870 --> 01:27:27,830
3:00 Tuesday?

883
01:27:29,332 --> 01:27:32,335
Yes, ma'am.
Yes, I understand.

884
01:27:39,467 --> 01:27:42,387
{y:i}They don't want to be alone
{y:i}in their healing anymore.

885
01:27:42,470 --> 01:27:45,932
{y:i}They want you to understand,
{y:i}to be aware...

886
01:27:47,016 --> 01:27:49,185
and to hear them.

887
01:27:49,227 --> 01:27:53,022
Beyond that, there are
no expectations.

888
01:27:54,482 --> 01:27:56,401
Are there any questions?

889
01:28:01,823 --> 01:28:04,909
Okay. Who would like
to go first?

890
01:28:06,411 --> 01:28:08,371
I would.

891
01:28:15,920 --> 01:28:17,755
My name is Maria...

892
01:28:18,756 --> 01:28:21,593
and my husband is Joseph.

893
01:28:29,434 --> 01:28:32,604
From the time I was a baby...

894
01:28:32,687 --> 01:28:35,440
until I was about
ten years old...

895
01:28:35,523 --> 01:28:38,943
I loved my father
more than anything else.

896
01:28:39,027 --> 01:28:42,030
Nobody could say anything bad
about him to me.

897
01:28:42,113 --> 01:28:44,449
The world loved him too.

898
01:28:48,328 --> 01:28:51,956
I have recently remembered
a lot of things.

899
01:28:54,834 --> 01:28:57,921
I remembered that
my father's favorite thing...

900
01:28:57,962 --> 01:29:00,965
was to kiss my vagina
when I was a baby.

901
01:29:03,217 --> 01:29:07,221
I remember I'd wake up in the middle
of the night sucking his penis.

902
01:29:09,599 --> 01:29:11,601
I didn't even know
what it was.

903
01:29:15,146 --> 01:29:18,107
My mother went away on a trip
when I was five years old.

904
01:29:20,485 --> 01:29:23,279
This was the first time
he put his penis in me.

905
01:29:24,864 --> 01:29:26,866
I bled for days.

906
01:29:29,953 --> 01:29:33,373
He told me that's what
daddies and little girls do...

907
01:29:34,874 --> 01:29:36,834
that it was our secret.

908
01:29:38,836 --> 01:29:42,757
He made me believe that every father
did that with their daughter.

909
01:29:45,468 --> 01:29:47,387
So I believed him...

910
01:29:53,268 --> 01:29:55,270
and I became that.

911
01:29:58,731 --> 01:30:00,733
And I enjoyed it too.

912
01:30:04,404 --> 01:30:06,990
It seemed to stop
when I was about 11 or 12.

913
01:30:07,073 --> 01:30:09,409
I don't know why...

914
01:30:10,702 --> 01:30:12,704
but I still loved him.

915
01:30:13,705 --> 01:30:15,707
I had no choice.

916
01:30:17,375 --> 01:30:19,877
I became the woman that
my father wanted me to be.

917
01:30:19,961 --> 01:30:21,879
I dressed how
he told me to dress.

918
01:30:21,963 --> 01:30:26,050
I presented myself
as a happy, bubbly girl.

919
01:30:29,053 --> 01:30:30,763
Still do.

920
01:30:33,266 --> 01:30:35,727
It's the way
that I block the feelings.

921
01:30:38,062 --> 01:30:40,565
It's the way
that I block the pain.

922
01:30:50,700 --> 01:30:52,869
I know I've been away
a long time.

923
01:30:56,414 --> 01:30:59,334
I had to confront my self-hatred...

924
01:30:59,417 --> 01:31:01,878
and I am terrified of you...

925
01:31:04,589 --> 01:31:08,009
but it's because
you make me feel so good...

926
01:31:09,761 --> 01:31:11,721
like my father did.

927
01:31:12,889 --> 01:31:17,810
My father, who was supposed to
keep me safe from harm, was the harm.

928
01:31:20,855 --> 01:31:22,774
Can you understand?

929
01:31:28,780 --> 01:31:30,615
Do you?

930
01:31:39,540 --> 01:31:42,043
{y:i}Look at the courage she has.

931
01:31:42,126 --> 01:31:46,297
So many people go
the other way, live as victims.

932
01:31:47,590 --> 01:31:52,220
They use their abuse as an excuse
to close down, to give in to life.

933
01:31:53,763 --> 01:31:55,640
How do you let it go?

934
01:31:56,766 --> 01:31:59,227
You look it straight
in the eye...

935
01:31:59,310 --> 01:32:01,771
and risk letting someone love you.

936
01:32:02,814 --> 01:32:04,816
Maria did that today.

937
01:32:09,696 --> 01:32:12,323
She's gonna be a different woman
when she gets through this.

938
01:32:14,784 --> 01:32:16,703
Yes.

939
01:32:32,427 --> 01:32:37,181
You know, it's not good for you
to have so many orgasms.

940
01:32:37,265 --> 01:32:39,267
You need to learn
to preserve your yang...

941
01:32:39,350 --> 01:32:41,269
and prolong your sexual activity.

942
01:32:41,352 --> 01:32:44,230
Good for you.
Good for your wife.

943
01:32:44,314 --> 01:32:48,192
- Okay. Thanks.
- Sure.

944
01:33:09,923 --> 01:33:13,301
I know.
I feel the same. Yeah.

945
01:33:14,761 --> 01:33:18,056
That sounds good. Okay.

946
01:33:18,139 --> 01:33:20,558
Right. Yeah.

947
01:33:42,997 --> 01:33:45,250
- Hi.
- Hi.

948
01:33:49,170 --> 01:33:51,422
Do you want
to have a seat?

949
01:33:51,464 --> 01:33:52,966
Sure.

950
01:34:03,142 --> 01:34:05,144
Do you want to play
"If you love me"?

951
01:34:09,440 --> 01:34:10,900
Okay.

952
01:34:14,362 --> 01:34:15,947
Okay.

953
01:34:20,410 --> 01:34:22,412
If you love me...

954
01:34:23,413 --> 01:34:26,040
you'll understand
that I needed time...

955
01:34:27,125 --> 01:34:29,586
to separate you from my abuse.

956
01:34:33,756 --> 01:34:36,467
I still wake up every morning
with my memories...

957
01:34:39,178 --> 01:34:40,930
my nightmares...

958
01:34:42,181 --> 01:34:44,058
but I'm facing them.

959
01:34:46,603 --> 01:34:49,188
I can't help feeling ugly...

960
01:34:50,481 --> 01:34:52,734
and ashamed.

961
01:35:00,491 --> 01:35:02,452
If you love me...

962
01:35:04,495 --> 01:35:06,497
let me come home.

963
01:35:44,035 --> 01:35:45,870
- Hi.
- Hi.

964
01:35:45,912 --> 01:35:47,622
I'm Eva.

965
01:35:48,623 --> 01:35:50,291
Are you here
for a violin lesson?

966
01:35:51,376 --> 01:35:53,336
No... Yes. Yes, yes, I am.

967
01:35:56,464 --> 01:36:00,593
I think I've got the wrong time,
so I'd probably better just...

968
01:36:03,012 --> 01:36:05,139
Eva, this is Joseph.

969
01:36:07,058 --> 01:36:08,518
We met.

970
01:36:09,560 --> 01:36:10,853
Bye, lover.

971
01:36:18,069 --> 01:36:20,154
I'll see you Friday...

972
01:36:20,238 --> 01:36:22,824
unless you want
to drop by the library.

973
01:36:27,912 --> 01:36:29,789
Good night, Joseph.

974
01:36:37,964 --> 01:36:40,008
- Client?
- No.

975
01:36:41,593 --> 01:36:44,512
That's the healing room.
This is my bedroom.

976
01:36:49,183 --> 01:36:50,893
A violin lesson, huh?

977
01:36:50,935 --> 01:36:52,895
Yes... No.

978
01:36:54,939 --> 01:36:58,568
I haven't exactly told her
what I do. I...

979
01:36:59,777 --> 01:37:01,738
I need a bit more time.

980
01:37:07,201 --> 01:37:09,537
Isn't she glorious?

981
01:37:09,621 --> 01:37:12,248
And you don't have to heal her?

982
01:37:15,460 --> 01:37:17,045
Do you...

983
01:37:17,128 --> 01:37:20,131
Do you ever smell her fragrance
when she's nowhere around?

984
01:37:21,549 --> 01:37:23,217
And do you...

985
01:37:24,302 --> 01:37:27,805
Do you know what she's thinking
before she even begins to tell you?

986
01:37:29,307 --> 01:37:31,351
Do you dread all the moments
in between?

987
01:37:40,193 --> 01:37:41,611
Too bad for you.
