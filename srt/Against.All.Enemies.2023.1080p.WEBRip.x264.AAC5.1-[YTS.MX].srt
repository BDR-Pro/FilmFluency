1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000


2
00:00:04,308 --> 00:00:06,049
I would love your reaction to
this.

3
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:08,051
I mean, this is something
that we've come across

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000


5
00:00:08,182 --> 00:00:10,401
in like a group that's
recruiting veterans.

6
00:00:10,706 --> 00:00:12,012
So if you like, what an extreme.

7
00:00:12,142 --> 00:00:14,971
You look at, like
questions 15, 16, and 17.

8
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:19,410
[dramatic music]

9
00:00:19,541 --> 00:00:21,543
Jesus. [chuckling]

10
00:00:21,673 --> 00:00:23,719
So I'm looking at an intake
questionnaire

11
00:00:23,849 --> 00:00:25,155
for a violent extremist group,

12
00:00:25,286 --> 00:00:26,635
and I'm gonna read you
three of the questions.

13
00:00:26,765 --> 00:00:28,941
Question 15, are you in
the military or a veteran?

14
00:00:29,072 --> 00:00:30,378
If so, which branch?

15
00:00:30,508 --> 00:00:32,162
16, if it comes down to it,

16
00:00:32,293 --> 00:00:33,946
would you go against the oath
you took

17
00:00:34,077 --> 00:00:35,687
in the military and law
enforcement?

18
00:00:35,818 --> 00:00:37,080
You could end up fighting
against

19
00:00:37,211 --> 00:00:39,126
your military/law enforcement
brothers.

20
00:00:41,345 --> 00:00:42,216
I,

21
00:00:43,608 --> 00:00:45,958
I mean,
I think you gotta consider
where somebody has to be

22
00:00:46,089 --> 00:00:48,352
in order to say yes to
those three questions.

23
00:00:49,223 --> 00:00:50,876
And also some of the
capabilities and training

24
00:00:51,007 --> 00:00:52,878
that some of these
individuals bring.

25
00:00:53,009 --> 00:00:54,445
There are places in our military

26
00:00:54,576 --> 00:00:59,407
where we are trained to
start and fuel insurgencies.

27
00:00:59,537 --> 00:01:02,149
There are places in our
military where we are trained

28
00:01:02,279 --> 00:01:03,889
to overthrow governments,

29
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:05,674
or work with armed militias

30
00:01:05,804 --> 00:01:06,892
in order to do
that sort of thing.

31
00:01:07,023 --> 00:01:08,503
I'm not saying
this to be alarmist,

32
00:01:08,633 --> 00:01:10,853
and I don't think we need to
be afraid of our veterans.

33
00:01:10,983 --> 00:01:12,507
What I do think is that we need

34
00:01:12,637 --> 00:01:14,335
to have a solid understanding

35
00:01:14,465 --> 00:01:17,599
of how badly this could
escalate.

36
00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:19,079
We're not at the point
where violence

37
00:01:19,209 --> 00:01:21,559
is the solution to our problems,

38
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:22,995
but there are a lot of people

39
00:01:23,126 --> 00:01:25,389
trying to convince vets
and others that we are,

40
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,391
and that is a very
dangerous thing.

41
00:01:30,481 --> 00:01:32,048
[Speaker 1] Today, domestic
terrorism

42
00:01:32,179 --> 00:01:34,790
is the greatest terrorist
threat facing the United States.

43
00:01:41,362 --> 00:01:43,494
[Speaker 2] The threat is
real, and we are all at risk.

44
00:01:43,625 --> 00:01:45,627
For decades,
violent extremist groups

45
00:01:45,757 --> 00:01:47,542
have sought to
infiltrate our military

46
00:01:47,672 --> 00:01:48,847
to gain tactical training

47
00:01:48,978 --> 00:01:50,545
and access to weapons and
explosives.

48
00:01:56,246 --> 00:01:57,900
[Speaker 3] I do believe
the oath means something,

49
00:01:58,030 --> 00:02:00,729
and I know that I'm going
directly against people

50
00:02:00,859 --> 00:02:03,253
who think that they also
are honoring their oath.

51
00:02:06,909 --> 00:02:09,259
[Speaker 4] I, I do
solemnly swear that I will

52
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:10,173
[Speaker 5] Support the
constitutional

53
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:11,870
of the United States.

54
00:02:12,001 --> 00:02:14,656
[Speaker 6] Against all
enemies, foreign and domestic.

55
00:02:14,786 --> 00:02:15,700
[Multiple Speakers] So help
me God,

56
00:02:15,831 --> 00:02:17,354
so help me God, so help me, God.

57
00:02:25,797 --> 00:02:28,583
[western music]

58
00:02:35,938 --> 00:02:40,943
Go ahead and fill up
this magazine. [exhaling]

59
00:02:47,036 --> 00:02:48,733
Asked a buddy of mine, I said,
hey man,

60
00:02:48,864 --> 00:02:50,300
"can you uh..."

61
00:02:50,431 --> 00:02:53,999
can you get me some
ammo, some decent ammo?

62
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:55,566
I can't find any.

63
00:02:55,697 --> 00:02:57,220
He said, yeah, man,

64
00:02:57,351 --> 00:02:58,787
I heard that there's a drug
dealer down on the corner.

65
00:02:58,917 --> 00:03:01,833
He's actually slinging
ammunition now instead of drugs.

66
00:03:05,141 --> 00:03:08,318
So bought some ammunition from
the drug dealer. [laughing]

67
00:03:11,103 --> 00:03:13,454
When people look at these guns,

68
00:03:13,584 --> 00:03:16,021
these rifles and these
handguns and so forth,

69
00:03:17,066 --> 00:03:19,286
there's a lot of folks that see
something

70
00:03:19,416 --> 00:03:20,852
that causes violence.

71
00:03:20,983 --> 00:03:22,680
They see something that's
dangerous

72
00:03:22,811 --> 00:03:25,857
and shouldn't be allowed
in society and so forth.

73
00:03:25,988 --> 00:03:28,643
What they don't realize
is that this is what

74
00:03:28,773 --> 00:03:29,948
gave us our freedom.

75
00:03:30,862 --> 00:03:32,473
This is what won our
independence.

76
00:03:32,603 --> 00:03:35,867
This is what protects
us from attack.

77
00:03:35,998 --> 00:03:38,174
It's not just our God-given,
right,

78
00:03:38,305 --> 00:03:40,524
to defend ourselves, it's
our constitutional right,

79
00:03:40,655 --> 00:03:43,745
but it's also, it's just right,

80
00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:45,790
when you think about it.

81
00:03:45,921 --> 00:03:48,271
This rifle will never
hurt or harm anybody

82
00:03:48,402 --> 00:03:50,317
unless something
comes up against it.

83
00:04:03,068 --> 00:04:04,548
Baby's ready to rock and roll.

84
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:08,596
[western music]

85
00:04:09,901 --> 00:04:11,338
Being a Texan,

86
00:04:11,468 --> 00:04:13,165
we're supposed to be able
to protect ourselves.

87
00:04:13,296 --> 00:04:15,298
The stuff that they
show you on the movies,

88
00:04:15,429 --> 00:04:17,126
that's our real life,
that's who we are.

89
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:18,693
The cowboy way,

90
00:04:18,823 --> 00:04:21,217
and the cowboy way is to
be able to defend yourself.

91
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:25,265
And, I'm proud to say that I
can do that,

92
00:04:25,395 --> 00:04:27,179
you know, pretty effectively.

93
00:04:28,877 --> 00:04:31,401
[gun firing]

94
00:04:36,014 --> 00:04:37,973
I learned how to ride a
horse when I was about six.

95
00:04:38,103 --> 00:04:41,150
The property that we lived
at was a lot like this.

96
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:42,804
Mesquite trees and so forth.

97
00:04:43,326 --> 00:04:45,850
[gun firing]

98
00:04:47,722 --> 00:04:50,420
My grandfather gave me my first
BB gun

99
00:04:50,551 --> 00:04:54,119
and showed me how to aim,
how to breathe and shoot.

100
00:04:56,034 --> 00:04:58,515
[gun firing]

101
00:04:58,776 --> 00:05:00,561
I was taught how to hone into a
target

102
00:05:00,691 --> 00:05:02,867
and be able to actually execute

103
00:05:02,998 --> 00:05:04,434
with whatever tool I'm using.

104
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:07,655
[gun firing]

105
00:05:10,135 --> 00:05:12,442
But what you learn in the
military and the army is,

106
00:05:12,573 --> 00:05:15,315
your scopes will fail you,
your red dots will fail you,

107
00:05:15,445 --> 00:05:19,449
the batteries will wear out,
but your irons never ever will.

108
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:22,583
So I've never had anything on
my rifles

109
00:05:22,713 --> 00:05:24,454
other than my iron sites.

110
00:05:25,716 --> 00:05:30,373
Not the best grouping, but
from 60 yards, 50 yards,

111
00:05:30,504 --> 00:05:31,896
it'll work.

112
00:05:32,027 --> 00:05:35,596
Up close, they'd all be in the
center.

113
00:05:39,164 --> 00:05:40,340
good boy

114
00:05:41,253 --> 00:05:42,864
Come on.

115
00:05:46,563 --> 00:05:48,043
Hey puppy.

116
00:05:48,173 --> 00:05:50,306
I spent my whole life
wanting to join the military.

117
00:05:50,437 --> 00:05:51,742
I mean, there's a photo right
behind me

118
00:05:51,873 --> 00:05:54,136
of me when I was probably
like five years old,

119
00:05:54,266 --> 00:05:57,618
wearing camouflage head to
toe with a pair of dog tags.

120
00:05:57,748 --> 00:06:00,011
I feel like most kids that
I grew up with

121
00:06:00,142 --> 00:06:01,535
went through a phase
of wanting to be

122
00:06:01,665 --> 00:06:04,625
a cop or a firefighter
or an army man, right?

123
00:06:04,755 --> 00:06:06,104
I never grew out of that.

124
00:06:06,235 --> 00:06:09,847
[Kristofer whistling]
[dog barking]

125
00:06:09,978 --> 00:06:13,111
And when I was 16 years old,
September 11th happened,

126
00:06:13,242 --> 00:06:17,855
and it kind of put a different
spin on that desire to serve.

127
00:06:17,986 --> 00:06:22,207
And I went to go out and find
bad guys and find justice.

128
00:06:23,165 --> 00:06:26,386
So this, when
I was 18 years old,

129
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:28,649
in basic training,

130
00:06:28,779 --> 00:06:30,868
and it's the standard
photo that you take

131
00:06:30,999 --> 00:06:34,002
before you know what anything
on the uniform means.

132
00:06:34,132 --> 00:06:36,396
So you notice there's
no ribbon, no name tag,

133
00:06:36,526 --> 00:06:40,791
anything like that, it's
a bare bones uniform.

134
00:06:40,922 --> 00:06:45,143
I was wearing a shirt, jacket,
and tie that weren't mine.

135
00:06:45,274 --> 00:06:47,929
I mean, this is ignorance
is bliss right here.

136
00:06:48,059 --> 00:06:49,974
That's what this photo is.

137
00:06:50,801 --> 00:06:53,456
The historical record
is absolutely clear

138
00:06:53,587 --> 00:06:55,153
that the aftermath of warfare

139
00:06:55,284 --> 00:06:58,418
is a danger point for
anti-democratic violence,

140
00:06:58,548 --> 00:06:59,854
for racist violence,

141
00:06:59,984 --> 00:07:02,334
for activity among Klan
and white power groups.

142
00:07:02,465 --> 00:07:04,946
There's no question
that this is the case.

143
00:07:05,076 --> 00:07:08,079
All of us, men, women, people
who have served or not,

144
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:09,864
old people, children,

145
00:07:09,994 --> 00:07:12,606
everyone becomes more violent
in the aftermath of warfare.

146
00:07:12,736 --> 00:07:14,346
I think that what
we don't know yet

147
00:07:14,477 --> 00:07:16,566
is what happens to that
phenomenon

148
00:07:16,697 --> 00:07:19,439
when we're talking
about a 20-year war.

149
00:07:21,049 --> 00:07:23,573
[dark music]

150
00:07:23,704 --> 00:07:25,880
My career started as a
enlisted soldier.

151
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:27,751
I was Private Crow,

152
00:07:27,882 --> 00:07:32,060
and then almost a decade later
it ended as Captain Crow.

153
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:34,584
Over that period, there were
well over 100 combat missions

154
00:07:34,715 --> 00:07:36,586
between Iraq and Afghanistan,

155
00:07:36,717 --> 00:07:38,327
and of course felt like I left

156
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,068
that part of my life behind me.

157
00:07:40,895 --> 00:07:43,419
[Speaker On Megaphone]
We will take that building.

158
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:45,508
[Speaker] We're gonna
storm the fucking capitol,

159
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:46,683
fuck you fuckers.

160
00:07:46,814 --> 00:07:48,729
So on January 6th,

161
00:07:48,859 --> 00:07:50,948
I had told all the
members of my staff

162
00:07:51,079 --> 00:07:53,168
not to come in to the office.

163
00:07:53,298 --> 00:07:56,867
I had heard reports of
Boogaloo Boys and Proud Boys

164
00:07:56,998 --> 00:08:00,871
and others filling flights
to come into the Capitol.

165
00:08:02,046 --> 00:08:04,832
[crowd shouting]

166
00:08:05,746 --> 00:08:08,444
I think as a lot of us watched
things unfold on the sixth,

167
00:08:08,575 --> 00:08:11,012
and then have looked at a
lot of the footage since,

168
00:08:11,142 --> 00:08:13,188
we see things
we recognize as veterans.

169
00:08:14,015 --> 00:08:16,757
That's affirmative,
Jesse is [indistinct].

170
00:08:16,887 --> 00:08:19,107
[Narrator] On January 6th,
2021,

171
00:08:19,237 --> 00:08:21,936
US military veterans who had
sworn an oath

172
00:08:22,066 --> 00:08:24,460
to defend the country were at
the vanguard

173
00:08:24,591 --> 00:08:26,680
of a violent attempt to stop
Congress

174
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:30,684
from certifying the 2020
presidential election.

175
00:08:30,814 --> 00:08:32,990
They were determined to keep
Joe Biden

176
00:08:33,121 --> 00:08:34,688
from becoming president.

177
00:08:34,818 --> 00:08:36,646
You can actually see, if you
look at it,

178
00:08:36,777 --> 00:08:37,647
the militia groups,

179
00:08:37,778 --> 00:08:38,909
you know, the Oath Keepers,

180
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:40,389
the Three Percenters, the Proud
Boys.

181
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,044
They're organized, they're
behaving tactically.

182
00:08:43,174 --> 00:08:46,090
They understand the dynamics of
a crowd,

183
00:08:46,221 --> 00:08:49,180
and they're maneuvering to
exploit that mass of bodies,

184
00:08:49,311 --> 00:08:51,879
so you see an organized
line of militia members

185
00:08:52,009 --> 00:08:53,968
with shields ready to go,
ready to exploit a breach,

186
00:08:54,098 --> 00:08:56,100
pushing the crowd in certain
directions.

187
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:00,844
The mob broke through into
the Capitol.

188
00:09:00,975 --> 00:09:03,455
They evacuated leadership,
they evacuated the floor,

189
00:09:03,586 --> 00:09:05,545
but they had forgotten
that there were about

190
00:09:05,675 --> 00:09:07,547
two dozen members
up in the gallery.

191
00:09:07,677 --> 00:09:10,071
[Member] Everybody stay down,
keep down.

192
00:09:11,638 --> 00:09:13,640
The floor of the House was
evacuated,

193
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:15,859
but there was no safe
evacuation route,

194
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:18,732
evidently from the the gallery.

195
00:09:18,862 --> 00:09:21,169
[Oath Keeper] There's no
safe place in the United States

196
00:09:21,299 --> 00:09:22,692
for any of these motherfuckers.

197
00:09:22,823 --> 00:09:26,957
Military principle 105,
cave means grave.

198
00:09:27,088 --> 00:09:28,306
And that's when I
realized we were trapped,

199
00:09:28,437 --> 00:09:29,656
there was no way out,

200
00:09:29,786 --> 00:09:30,831
and we would likely have to
make a stand

201
00:09:30,961 --> 00:09:32,397
or fight our way out.

202
00:09:32,528 --> 00:09:34,356
This was one of the most
shocking moments of my life.

203
00:09:34,486 --> 00:09:36,010
I made the decision
to call my wife

204
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:38,316
and let her know that I love her

205
00:09:38,447 --> 00:09:40,492
and tell the kids
that I love them.

206
00:09:41,624 --> 00:09:45,976
The only time that the US
Capitol had been breached before

207
00:09:46,107 --> 00:09:47,717
was in the war of 1812,

208
00:09:47,848 --> 00:09:50,024
and that was care of the
British King.

209
00:09:50,894 --> 00:09:52,679
[Rioter] Here we are in the
Capitol.

210
00:09:52,809 --> 00:09:55,856
No looking back now,
boys, no looking back.

211
00:09:55,986 --> 00:09:57,422
[Oath Keeper] This is what
we fucking lived up for,

212
00:09:57,553 --> 00:09:59,773
everything we fucking
trained for.

213
00:09:59,903 --> 00:10:01,426
Wow.

214
00:10:01,557 --> 00:10:03,951
This was the kind of
experience that I expected

215
00:10:04,081 --> 00:10:05,300
as a US Marine in Iraq,

216
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:07,911
but could never even imagine
happening

217
00:10:08,042 --> 00:10:10,871
as a United States
Congressman in Washington, DC.

218
00:10:11,001 --> 00:10:12,220
You know, many people
have seen the pictures.

219
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:15,005
They had barred the
door to the gallery.

220
00:10:15,136 --> 00:10:16,311
They were banging on that door

221
00:10:16,441 --> 00:10:18,530
and breaking the
glass to that door.

222
00:10:18,661 --> 00:10:20,010
And I've often asked myself,

223
00:10:20,141 --> 00:10:22,622
how did I end up on one side of
that door

224
00:10:22,752 --> 00:10:27,148
and my fellow veterans who
raised their same right hand

225
00:10:27,278 --> 00:10:28,932
and took the same
oath that I took,

226
00:10:29,063 --> 00:10:31,065
how did they end up on the
other side of that door?

227
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:35,722
[crowd shouting]

228
00:10:38,725 --> 00:10:41,336
[Narrator] Nearly 150
law enforcement officers

229
00:10:41,466 --> 00:10:42,859
were injured in the melee.

230
00:10:45,906 --> 00:10:47,647
Five protestors died,

231
00:10:47,777 --> 00:10:51,128
and another four police officers
later committed suicide.

232
00:10:51,259 --> 00:10:52,739
[Officer] We've lost the line.

233
00:10:52,869 --> 00:10:55,002
Donald Trump
tweeted out a video.

234
00:10:55,132 --> 00:10:58,440
He said, we did
a good fucking job.

235
00:10:58,570 --> 00:10:59,615
[Narrator] Among those charged

236
00:10:59,746 --> 00:11:01,356
in connection with the attack,

237
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:05,752
a disproportionate number
are US military veterans.

238
00:11:07,057 --> 00:11:09,494
[explosions]

239
00:11:10,974 --> 00:11:13,498
[dark music]

240
00:11:18,416 --> 00:11:19,679
For me now, the Capitol

241
00:11:19,809 --> 00:11:22,159
is almost like walking
around Gettysburg,

242
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:25,336
or Antietam, or going
to Pearl Harbor.

243
00:11:25,467 --> 00:11:28,165
And my son Michael was killed
in action in Afghanistan

244
00:11:28,296 --> 00:11:30,341
on June 14th, 2008.

245
00:11:30,472 --> 00:11:31,952
And when you join the military,

246
00:11:32,082 --> 00:11:35,129
there's a lot of competing
ideals of why you show up.

247
00:11:35,259 --> 00:11:39,394
And for most of it, there's
a large amount of patriotism.

248
00:11:43,833 --> 00:11:46,401
But you never lose focus
and never lose sight that,

249
00:11:47,619 --> 00:11:50,579
I'm here in this country maybe
to give them a better chance

250
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,668
to experience what
we have in America.

251
00:11:53,321 --> 00:11:54,757
Where it's not perfect.

252
00:11:54,888 --> 00:11:58,108
We are trying to form a more
perfect union every day,

253
00:11:58,239 --> 00:12:00,458
and we want to give that
chance to other people.

254
00:12:01,982 --> 00:12:04,854
My son died doing that in
Afghanistan,

255
00:12:04,985 --> 00:12:08,423
only for us to lose
that sight here.

256
00:12:12,557 --> 00:12:15,125
Veterans who swear that oath

257
00:12:15,256 --> 00:12:18,302
to protect and defend the
Constitution of the
United States

258
00:12:18,433 --> 00:12:22,306
against all enemies,
foreign and domestic,

259
00:12:22,437 --> 00:12:23,917
of all Americans.

260
00:12:24,961 --> 00:12:26,136
They should understand

261
00:12:27,442 --> 00:12:32,490
how dangerous and unpatriotic
this insurrection was.

262
00:12:34,362 --> 00:12:39,410
They were trying to overthrow
democratic election results.

263
00:12:39,846 --> 00:12:43,240
They shouted for the hanging
of our own Vice President.

264
00:12:44,633 --> 00:12:45,852
That's a coup attempt.

265
00:12:49,594 --> 00:12:51,205
Watching the insurrection
happen,

266
00:12:51,335 --> 00:12:53,990
and we're gonna call it that,
because that's what it was.

267
00:12:54,121 --> 00:12:56,688
And watching veterans
participate,

268
00:12:56,819 --> 00:12:59,561
being at the vanguard
of that insurrection,

269
00:12:59,691 --> 00:13:01,041
it just, it's mind boggling.

270
00:13:01,171 --> 00:13:03,652
But I don't have a really
good answer for why,

271
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:05,393
why veterans would do that.

272
00:13:05,523 --> 00:13:08,048
[gun firing]

273
00:13:10,615 --> 00:13:12,574
Though I was trained to blow
stuff up,

274
00:13:12,704 --> 00:13:16,970
and run with the infantry,
I became this unofficial,

275
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:19,146
on the ground intelligence
reporter.

276
00:13:19,276 --> 00:13:21,365
On May 15th, 2005,

277
00:13:22,497 --> 00:13:25,326
we got called to
respond to a body

278
00:13:25,456 --> 00:13:28,155
that was found in a trash
dump outside Sadr City.

279
00:13:28,982 --> 00:13:31,506
When we got there, we realized
that it wasn't a body,

280
00:13:31,636 --> 00:13:33,508
it was a bunch of bodies,

281
00:13:36,163 --> 00:13:39,383
and I had never experienced
anything like it.

282
00:13:39,514 --> 00:13:41,646
And now as I was taking photos,

283
00:13:41,777 --> 00:13:43,561
close up photos of these faces

284
00:13:43,692 --> 00:13:45,781
of victims of murder and
torture,

285
00:13:45,912 --> 00:13:47,000
I was looking at their wounds

286
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:48,392
and looking at
the packaging tape

287
00:13:48,523 --> 00:13:49,741
that was wrapped
around their eyes

288
00:13:49,872 --> 00:13:51,831
and imagining
the terror that they felt.

289
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:55,530
And every time I snap a picture,

290
00:13:56,661 --> 00:13:58,881
one of those faces freezes.

291
00:13:59,012 --> 00:14:02,145
And the way that
it froze on the screen,

292
00:14:02,276 --> 00:14:03,320
it froze in my head.

293
00:14:05,801 --> 00:14:09,109
But that was just a day of
deployment.

294
00:14:09,239 --> 00:14:13,374
And I had six and a half
months, seven months

295
00:14:13,504 --> 00:14:15,158
left of Iraq to deal with that.

296
00:14:18,945 --> 00:14:21,295
I went in as 11 Bravo to the
army.

297
00:14:21,425 --> 00:14:22,862
I scored fairly high,

298
00:14:22,992 --> 00:14:24,602
so I went to Airborne School,

299
00:14:24,733 --> 00:14:26,866
which was gonna be my
next step of training

300
00:14:26,996 --> 00:14:28,737
for special forces.

301
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,434
And during that time,

302
00:14:30,565 --> 00:14:32,567
I ended up getting injured
really badly.

303
00:14:35,787 --> 00:14:37,224
When I came home,

304
00:14:37,354 --> 00:14:40,314
I had spent my entire adult
life up to that point,

305
00:14:40,444 --> 00:14:43,491
either training for combat or
in combat.

306
00:14:43,621 --> 00:14:47,408
It was hard for me to think of
anything positive in any way,

307
00:14:47,538 --> 00:14:49,758
whether it's for myself or for
my country

308
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:52,195
or for democracy or for the
world.

309
00:14:53,457 --> 00:14:58,071
I couldn't help but base my
beliefs

310
00:14:58,201 --> 00:15:00,987
and my feelings on my
experiences,

311
00:15:01,117 --> 00:15:04,207
all of which had been
horrifically fucking negative.

312
00:15:06,731 --> 00:15:09,256
When most come out of the
military,

313
00:15:09,386 --> 00:15:11,301
they're coming out to a world

314
00:15:11,432 --> 00:15:12,999
that they no longer understand
anymore.

315
00:15:13,129 --> 00:15:14,739
You really get lost in that life

316
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:15,784
when you're in the military.

317
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:17,177
And you know what happens is,

318
00:15:17,307 --> 00:15:19,179
you have the camaraderie, the
friendship,

319
00:15:19,309 --> 00:15:21,355
all the good things that
you have in the military.

320
00:15:21,485 --> 00:15:23,139
And then when you come out,

321
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:27,752
you kind of have society that's
undisciplined, incapable,

322
00:15:27,883 --> 00:15:30,016
and just downright ugly.

323
00:15:31,408 --> 00:15:32,888
Good evening, I'm Jamie
Yuccas.

324
00:15:33,019 --> 00:15:35,673
A massive police presence
in Portland, Oregon today,

325
00:15:35,804 --> 00:15:38,938
in anticipation of a
violent confrontation.

326
00:15:40,591 --> 00:15:41,549
[muffled speaking]

327
00:15:41,679 --> 00:15:43,116
I'm a proud boy.

328
00:15:43,246 --> 00:15:45,031
I'm president of the
Hellgate Bridge Crew chapter

329
00:15:45,161 --> 00:15:46,206
in New York City.

330
00:15:46,336 --> 00:15:48,121
I'm also an Air Force veteran.

331
00:15:48,251 --> 00:15:50,166
What we're going
through right now

332
00:15:50,297 --> 00:15:53,126
is a war on the US Constitution.

333
00:15:53,256 --> 00:15:57,086
Biggest reason why I joined
the Air Force myself,

334
00:15:57,217 --> 00:16:00,046
it's to give back to my
country, to serve my country.

335
00:16:00,176 --> 00:16:04,485
I think a lot of that kind of
came from my up upbringing.

336
00:16:04,615 --> 00:16:06,139
The family that I grew up in,

337
00:16:06,269 --> 00:16:07,792
very proud to be an American,

338
00:16:08,837 --> 00:16:10,317
very proud of what America
stood for,

339
00:16:10,447 --> 00:16:13,450
what it represented around
the world, very patriotic.

340
00:16:13,581 --> 00:16:15,844
And I think a lot of those
things are what's lost today.

341
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:18,194
Members of the Proud Boys and
Antifa

342
00:16:18,325 --> 00:16:19,891
fought multiple times.

343
00:16:20,022 --> 00:16:22,068
And Mayor Ted Wheeler just
sent out a statement late today

344
00:16:22,198 --> 00:16:25,767
saying this past weekend quote,
put innocent lives at risk.

345
00:16:25,897 --> 00:16:27,116
[guns firing]

346
00:16:27,247 --> 00:16:27,943
[Narrator] The Proud Boys
were founded

347
00:16:28,074 --> 00:16:30,163
in New York in 2016.

348
00:16:30,293 --> 00:16:33,253
You wanna keep on bucking
a sleeping bear, guess what?

349
00:16:33,383 --> 00:16:35,733
It's gonna rise up and it's
going be 1776

350
00:16:35,864 --> 00:16:36,778
up into this bitch.

351
00:16:36,908 --> 00:16:38,388
[Narrator] And are classified

352
00:16:38,519 --> 00:16:41,565
as an international terrorist
organization by Canada.

353
00:16:41,696 --> 00:16:43,002
We're western chauvinists.

354
00:16:43,132 --> 00:16:45,569
What that essentially means is
that we're

355
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:46,788
the biggest cheerleaders

356
00:16:46,918 --> 00:16:49,312
for western values,
western culture,

357
00:16:49,443 --> 00:16:52,881
small government, maximum
freedom, maximum liberty,

358
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:55,318
pro-First Amendment, pro-Second
Amendment,

359
00:16:55,449 --> 00:16:58,365
glorifying the entrepreneur,
venerating the housewife.

360
00:16:58,495 --> 00:17:01,107
We're not militaristic in
any way, shape or form.

361
00:17:01,237 --> 00:17:03,587
The fact of the matter is, you
have good guys in this world,

362
00:17:03,718 --> 00:17:04,980
you have bad guys in this world,

363
00:17:05,111 --> 00:17:08,244
and the only way to
stand up to the bad guys

364
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:09,680
is to fight them.

365
00:17:09,811 --> 00:17:11,378
[Narrator] They came
to prominence in America

366
00:17:11,508 --> 00:17:15,077
in September, 2020 during
a presidential debate

367
00:17:15,208 --> 00:17:17,210
between Joe Biden and Donald
Trump.

368
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:18,472
[Moderator] White
supremacists.

369
00:17:18,602 --> 00:17:19,951
And who would you like me to
condemn?

370
00:17:20,082 --> 00:17:21,214
[talking at the same time]

371
00:17:21,344 --> 00:17:24,391
Proud Boys, stand back and
stand by.

372
00:17:24,521 --> 00:17:27,263
When I saw the President
of the United States

373
00:17:27,394 --> 00:17:31,224
telling an extremist violent
organization, stand by,

374
00:17:32,312 --> 00:17:34,314
that was a chilling moment.

375
00:17:34,444 --> 00:17:37,099
That was a chilling
moment for me.

376
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:38,405
It wasn't any different

377
00:17:38,535 --> 00:17:40,146
than a President of
the United States

378
00:17:40,276 --> 00:17:42,626
telling Al-Qaeda or
telling ISIS, look,

379
00:17:42,757 --> 00:17:44,846
I have a tough election,
stand by.

380
00:17:44,976 --> 00:17:46,195
Let me tell you
what you need to do.

381
00:17:46,326 --> 00:17:48,284
Did we get a lot of notoriety?

382
00:17:48,415 --> 00:17:49,981
Absolutely, of course we did.

383
00:17:50,112 --> 00:17:53,072
But at the very same time,
it's not because we're racists,

384
00:17:53,202 --> 00:17:55,161
it's not because we're white
supremacists.

385
00:17:55,291 --> 00:17:57,380
If we think about
what the militant right

386
00:17:57,511 --> 00:17:59,643
and white power movement
looks like today,

387
00:17:59,774 --> 00:18:01,080
there are many of these groups.

388
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:04,039
The specifics can change
from group to group,

389
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:07,042
but the overall
intent is the same.

390
00:18:07,173 --> 00:18:09,349
The common ideology is simple.

391
00:18:09,479 --> 00:18:11,307
We had power,

392
00:18:11,438 --> 00:18:13,570
we should have power.

393
00:18:13,701 --> 00:18:15,616
Power is being
taken away from us,

394
00:18:15,746 --> 00:18:18,488
and by any means necessary,
we can get it back.

395
00:18:18,619 --> 00:18:20,099
Fascist groups, you have
national socialist groups,

396
00:18:20,229 --> 00:18:21,709
you have southern
nationalist groups,

397
00:18:21,839 --> 00:18:23,102
you have all types of groups
with all types of creeds.

398
00:18:23,232 --> 00:18:24,668
But ultimately
we're all being united

399
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:26,453
because we all believe
in the same thing,

400
00:18:26,583 --> 00:18:28,716
which is ultimately that white
people have a right to exist.

401
00:18:28,846 --> 00:18:32,328
[Simon] And whether
the we is a white, we.

402
00:18:32,459 --> 00:18:35,070
Jews will not replace us.

403
00:18:35,723 --> 00:18:38,204
Whether the we is an
anti-government we,

404
00:18:38,334 --> 00:18:40,075
they're all intertwined.

405
00:18:40,206 --> 00:18:41,903
The more laws they pass,

406
00:18:42,033 --> 00:18:44,862
it's gonna end up the people
versus the government.

407
00:18:44,993 --> 00:18:46,864
Right now, we're being peaceful.

408
00:18:46,995 --> 00:18:48,127
In the future, nobody knows

409
00:18:48,257 --> 00:18:50,172
when that breaking point's
gonna hit.

410
00:18:51,304 --> 00:18:53,741
Should have hit a long
time ago personally for me.

411
00:18:53,871 --> 00:18:55,482
A lot of people think
that, ah, you know,

412
00:18:55,612 --> 00:18:58,267
these are knuckleheads and we
shouldn't worry about them.

413
00:18:58,398 --> 00:19:00,617
Unfortunately, we said the
same thing about the Jihadis,

414
00:19:00,748 --> 00:19:02,706
prior to the events of 9-11.

415
00:19:02,837 --> 00:19:04,534
They live in caves in
Afghanistan.

416
00:19:04,665 --> 00:19:06,580
They don't pose any
threat to the homeland.

417
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:09,974
But by the time we decided
to go after them, after 9-11,

418
00:19:10,105 --> 00:19:11,672
it was a little bit too late.

419
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:17,112
[rioters cheering]

420
00:19:17,808 --> 00:19:20,202
I would like to think that
we would draw the attention

421
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:22,117
of people that are from the
military

422
00:19:22,248 --> 00:19:24,250
with the military background.

423
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:26,991
And I think it would be true
of like the Three Percenters,

424
00:19:27,122 --> 00:19:28,645
or the Oath Keepers.

425
00:19:28,776 --> 00:19:31,518
The one thread that kind of
combines all of our groups

426
00:19:31,648 --> 00:19:34,738
is the US Constitution,
our respect for it.

427
00:19:35,783 --> 00:19:38,786
[muffled speaking]

428
00:19:46,533 --> 00:19:49,405
And I signed up to defend
this country.

429
00:19:49,536 --> 00:19:52,408
I was essentially joining
the Three Percenters already.

430
00:19:52,539 --> 00:19:55,759
The oath of enlistment
is the exact oath

431
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:56,891
of a Three Percenter.

432
00:19:57,021 --> 00:19:58,675
I do solemnly swear.

433
00:19:58,806 --> 00:20:00,721
[All] I do solemnly swear.

434
00:20:00,851 --> 00:20:03,898
That I will support and
defend the Constitution.

435
00:20:04,028 --> 00:20:06,944
[All] That I will support
and defend the Constitution.

436
00:20:07,075 --> 00:20:08,685
Of the United States.

437
00:20:08,816 --> 00:20:10,687
[All] Of United States

438
00:20:10,818 --> 00:20:12,167
Against all enemies

439
00:20:12,298 --> 00:20:14,213
[All] Against all enemies.

440
00:20:14,343 --> 00:20:15,866
Foreign and domestic.

441
00:20:15,997 --> 00:20:18,391
[All] Foreign and domestic.

442
00:20:18,521 --> 00:20:21,524
In Atlanta,
I met up with 3% SF,

443
00:20:21,655 --> 00:20:23,700
and some of the
other brothers out there.

444
00:20:23,831 --> 00:20:27,008
And everybody was upset
about the election.

445
00:20:27,138 --> 00:20:29,793
I mean basically we're
looking at a criminal

446
00:20:29,924 --> 00:20:32,274
that has become our
President, illegitimately.

447
00:20:34,015 --> 00:20:36,322
Joe Biden has already harmed
this country.

448
00:20:36,452 --> 00:20:38,106
His son has already
harmed this country.

449
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:42,197
We know for a fact that that
family is a criminal family.

450
00:20:43,154 --> 00:20:47,202
The situation we're in is
a situation of treason.

451
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:50,031
The punishment for
treason is death.

452
00:20:51,902 --> 00:20:55,079
In America, you have the
right to be an asshole.

453
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:57,299
You have the right to have

454
00:20:57,430 --> 00:20:59,040
the most pathetic
views in the world.

455
00:20:59,170 --> 00:21:00,259
I don't have to agree with you,

456
00:21:00,389 --> 00:21:01,782
you don't have to agree with me.

457
00:21:01,912 --> 00:21:03,871
That is a right protected
by the First Amendment.

458
00:21:04,001 --> 00:21:06,265
I think when we talk about
violent extremist groups,

459
00:21:06,395 --> 00:21:10,356
we're talking about
individuals that go beyond

460
00:21:11,531 --> 00:21:13,881
the narrative to violence.

461
00:21:14,011 --> 00:21:17,624
People who are planning to
attack the US government,

462
00:21:17,754 --> 00:21:19,408
because it's an evil empire.

463
00:21:19,539 --> 00:21:21,584
People who are trying to

464
00:21:21,715 --> 00:21:25,414
kill Jews or kill immigrants
or kill black people,

465
00:21:25,545 --> 00:21:28,678
just based on their race
or on their religion.

466
00:21:28,809 --> 00:21:33,074
When you move away
from the narrative,

467
00:21:33,204 --> 00:21:37,034
as ugly as that narrative is,

468
00:21:37,165 --> 00:21:40,560
to carry out violence
based on that narrative,

469
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:43,824
to recruit individuals
to carry out violence

470
00:21:43,954 --> 00:21:45,521
based on that narrative,

471
00:21:45,652 --> 00:21:48,045
then you are a violent
extremist.

472
00:21:48,176 --> 00:21:50,265
Then you're frankly a terrorist.

473
00:21:52,746 --> 00:21:54,182
[explosion]

474
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:57,185
[soldier yelling]

475
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,842
We used to talk about IEDs,

476
00:22:01,972 --> 00:22:05,062
improvised explosive devices in
Iraq,

477
00:22:05,193 --> 00:22:07,413
and they were incredibly lethal.

478
00:22:07,543 --> 00:22:10,416
And what we learned as
we tried to stop this,

479
00:22:10,546 --> 00:22:12,679
was that the problem
was not the bomb itself,

480
00:22:12,809 --> 00:22:16,117
the problem, you had
to go left of the boom.

481
00:22:16,247 --> 00:22:18,859
You had to go upstream
to the problem

482
00:22:18,989 --> 00:22:21,122
and look at where the
problem is coming from.

483
00:22:21,252 --> 00:22:22,210
Where's the energy?

484
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:23,951
January 6th now.

485
00:22:24,081 --> 00:22:28,738
A militia group had stashes
of guns on the outskirts of DC

486
00:22:28,869 --> 00:22:32,568
ready to go on that fateful
day during the insurrection.

487
00:22:32,699 --> 00:22:34,962
That's just one of the
alarming allegations

488
00:22:35,092 --> 00:22:36,703
from the Justice Department
today,

489
00:22:36,833 --> 00:22:39,706
after the feds charged the
leader, Stewart Rhodes,

490
00:22:39,836 --> 00:22:41,621
and several members of
the right wing group,

491
00:22:41,751 --> 00:22:45,581
the Oath Keepers, with
seditious conspiracy.

492
00:22:45,712 --> 00:22:48,279
[Narrator] Stewart Rhodes
is a former army paratrooper

493
00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:50,412
with a law degree from Yale.

494
00:22:50,543 --> 00:22:53,589
In 2009, he founded the Oath
Keepers,

495
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,896
a shadowy organization that
recruited

496
00:22:56,026 --> 00:22:57,593
law enforcement officers,

497
00:22:57,724 --> 00:23:00,422
active duty military and
veterans.

498
00:23:00,553 --> 00:23:04,383
Their mission was to supposedly
defend the US Constitution,

499
00:23:04,513 --> 00:23:07,298
but it quickly devolved
into an armed militia

500
00:23:07,429 --> 00:23:10,084
dedicated to overthrowing
the US government.

501
00:23:12,608 --> 00:23:14,349
The founders told us with
their wisdom

502
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,959
that we must be the militia.

503
00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:18,875
You will not be secure,
you'll not be free without it.

504
00:23:19,006 --> 00:23:20,573
It's time we resurrect that

505
00:23:20,703 --> 00:23:22,923
and become
the militia once again.

506
00:23:23,053 --> 00:23:25,404
[Narrator] There are
thought to be 35,000 members

507
00:23:25,534 --> 00:23:26,796
in the organization,

508
00:23:26,927 --> 00:23:28,711
most of them heavily armed.

509
00:23:28,842 --> 00:23:31,453
And January 6th was not
the first time Rhodes

510
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:34,848
assembled his forces and
an arsenal of weapons.

511
00:23:34,978 --> 00:23:36,415

in Louisville, Kentucky,

513
00:23:37,894 --> 00:23:39,853
after a grand jury decided not
to indict

514
00:23:39,983 --> 00:23:41,289

515
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:43,639

Late this afternoon,

518
00:23:47,774 --> 00:23:49,993
protestors clashed with police.

519
00:23:57,174 --> 00:23:58,741
Guys, bring it in.

520
00:23:58,872 --> 00:24:00,308
Pay attention, can't talk
and listen at the same time.

521
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:03,050
You're in a military
operation, behave like it.

522
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:05,400
Overdrive,
it's gonna be Bravo team.

523
00:24:05,531 --> 00:24:07,794
And the pawn shop's
gonna be Charlie Team.

00:24:07,924 --> 00:24:10,144
[Narrator] Following the
killing of Breonna Taylor,

525
00:24:10,274 --> 00:24:12,189
the Oath Keepers
went to Kentucky

526
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,975
alongside local militia groups.

527
00:24:15,105 --> 00:24:17,891
We're here in Louisville to
protect this Shell station,

528
00:24:18,021 --> 00:24:20,415
and also the pawn shop
across the street,

529
00:24:20,546 --> 00:24:22,939
and also a private residence.

530
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:25,768
We can't predict unpredictable,
you can't predict chaos,

531
00:24:25,899 --> 00:24:27,161
you can't predict stupid.

532
00:24:28,205 --> 00:24:31,470
[ominous music]

533
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,689
[Speaker] Is there gonna be
enough room?

534
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:35,474
My main message
is you gotta get ready

535
00:24:35,604 --> 00:24:37,214
and prepare yourselves
and your communities

536
00:24:37,345 --> 00:24:40,479
for what we see coming, where
I think it's unavoidable now.

537
00:24:40,609 --> 00:24:42,263
You got too many
brainwashed Americans

538
00:24:42,393 --> 00:24:43,482
who have been brainwashed

539
00:24:43,612 --> 00:24:44,874
by communist professors
and teachers

540
00:24:45,005 --> 00:24:46,441
to hate their own country.

541
00:24:46,572 --> 00:24:48,965
[protestors chanting]
Whose streets? Our streets.

542
00:24:49,096 --> 00:24:50,750
[protestors chanting]
What do we want? Justice!

543
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,491
[protestors chanting]
When do we want it? Now!

544
00:24:52,621 --> 00:24:53,927
What do you do with someone
that hates their own country,

545
00:24:54,057 --> 00:24:55,668
that hates you,

546
00:24:55,798 --> 00:24:57,800
by close extension if you
believe in your country still?

547
00:24:57,931 --> 00:25:00,542
Three, two, one, go.

548
00:25:01,848 --> 00:25:04,590
[ominous music]

549
00:25:07,201 --> 00:25:09,551
[Speaker] Right behind
you, right behind you.

550
00:25:09,682 --> 00:25:11,597
It's almost like you're
in a foreign country

551
00:25:11,727 --> 00:25:14,730
doing a stability operation
against an insurgency.

552
00:25:14,861 --> 00:25:18,517
One of our guys up there
is SF - Special Forces vet,

553
00:25:18,647 --> 00:25:22,129
and we got another one that's
a retired Staff Sergeant, SF.

554
00:25:23,043 --> 00:25:25,306
I'm not surprised that
extremist organizations

555
00:25:25,436 --> 00:25:28,004
try to recruit veterans for
the credibility that we bring,

556
00:25:28,135 --> 00:25:29,528
but also for our commitment.

557
00:25:29,658 --> 00:25:31,704
And that commitment
takes a lot of forms.

558
00:25:31,834 --> 00:25:33,706
Veterans are people
in our society

559
00:25:33,836 --> 00:25:34,837
who in many ways have said,

560
00:25:34,968 --> 00:25:36,752
I will do whatever is necessary

561
00:25:36,883 --> 00:25:38,232
to preserve what I believe in,

562
00:25:38,362 --> 00:25:40,060
to preserve the baseline values

563
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:41,714
and the baseline existence of
my society

564
00:25:41,844 --> 00:25:43,324
up to and including violence.

565
00:25:44,673 --> 00:25:45,848
Put a scope on them,

566
00:25:45,979 --> 00:25:46,936
take a peek at 'em,
see what they got.

567
00:25:47,067 --> 00:25:48,329
That's same kinda of shit

568
00:25:48,459 --> 00:25:49,896
that they've been doing
their whole career.

569
00:25:50,026 --> 00:25:51,027
Now they're doing it here
inside the United States.

570
00:25:51,158 --> 00:25:52,638
It's kind of a weird feeling.

571
00:25:52,768 --> 00:25:55,597
I have two purple hearts
already and a bronze star.

572
00:25:55,728 --> 00:25:57,556
They said David, the only
way we'll call you back in

573
00:25:57,686 --> 00:25:59,470
is if the shit's
gonna hit the fan.

574
00:25:59,601 --> 00:26:02,169
I came home to visit my
mom in Crestwood, Kentucky.

575
00:26:02,299 --> 00:26:03,736
I was taking a shower,

576
00:26:03,866 --> 00:26:06,216
she come pounding on the
door early in the morning.

577
00:26:06,347 --> 00:26:07,522
She pointed at the
TV about the time

578
00:26:07,653 --> 00:26:08,915
the second airplane hits, 9-11.

579
00:26:10,046 --> 00:26:13,223
Well, three weeks later
I was getting my shots.

580
00:26:13,354 --> 00:26:15,878
Our group was the second
group to enter Afghanistan.

581
00:26:16,009 --> 00:26:17,010
Hell yeah, man.

582
00:26:19,055 --> 00:26:21,841
It's, it's so enticing.

583
00:26:21,971 --> 00:26:22,842
I mean,

584
00:26:24,365 --> 00:26:26,106
God you get to fight again.

585
00:26:28,195 --> 00:26:29,979
You're trained
in certain things.

586
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:32,591
You can see the battlefield
better.

587
00:26:32,721 --> 00:26:34,244
If you believe the country's
under attack,

588
00:26:34,375 --> 00:26:35,768
you have a certain set of skills

589
00:26:35,898 --> 00:26:39,206
that maybe you were
trained with, that you can,

590
00:26:39,336 --> 00:26:40,860
help the group around you, right?

591
00:26:40,990 --> 00:26:42,470
You're a force multiplier.

592
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:45,125
The quintessential examples
of a force multiplier

593
00:26:45,255 --> 00:26:47,954
are Special Forces,
Army Green Berets,

594
00:26:48,084 --> 00:26:51,566
these 12 man A teams that
actually go behind enemy lines

595
00:26:51,697 --> 00:26:53,568
and train up to a battalion,

596
00:26:53,699 --> 00:26:57,746
up to 6 or 700 local indigenous
forces on combat skills.

597
00:26:57,877 --> 00:26:59,139
Certainly, I think
that's one of the reasons

598
00:26:59,269 --> 00:27:00,967
why some of these
extremist groups

599
00:27:01,097 --> 00:27:03,883
are recruiting these individuals

600
00:27:04,013 --> 00:27:06,015
very deliberately
into their movements.

601
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:08,888
They're fucking coming.

602
00:27:10,672 --> 00:27:12,674
We need to get locked and
loaded and ready to go.

603
00:27:12,805 --> 00:27:15,285
Hey guys, everybody
spread out, get eyes open,

604
00:27:15,416 --> 00:27:17,200
get a good perimeter.

605
00:27:30,561 --> 00:27:34,696
When I was 21
and severely damaged

606
00:27:34,827 --> 00:27:36,916
from a war that
I had been lied into

607
00:27:37,046 --> 00:27:39,701
and that my friends
were dying for.

608
00:27:39,832 --> 00:27:41,529
When a guy like Stewart Rhodes
comes along

609
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:44,445
with a Yale law degree and
they see the eye patch.

610
00:27:44,575 --> 00:27:46,665
They don't know that he
shot himself at a range,

611
00:27:46,795 --> 00:27:48,841
but they assume he's a combat
wounded vet,

612
00:27:48,971 --> 00:27:50,320
and says like, hey,

613
00:27:50,451 --> 00:27:52,409
you can support and
defend the Constitution

614
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:55,674
in the United States
standing with us.

615
00:27:55,804 --> 00:27:59,503
And just repeats the words
of the the Second Amendment.

616
00:27:59,634 --> 00:28:03,377
That that's all it took for
me to be like, okay, you know,

617
00:28:03,507 --> 00:28:04,595
you've got the pedigree,

618
00:28:04,726 --> 00:28:05,858
you've got the background.

619
00:28:05,988 --> 00:28:07,642
So why should I challenge that?

620
00:28:07,773 --> 00:28:09,513
You know, I have no basis

621
00:28:09,862 --> 00:28:13,474
in experience or
education to challenge it.

622
00:28:13,953 --> 00:28:16,782
[sirens blaring]

623
00:28:28,315 --> 00:28:30,404
The challenge with having
veterans

624
00:28:30,534 --> 00:28:33,015
directly involved is twofold.

625
00:28:33,146 --> 00:28:36,584
The first is that they
bring a certain expertise.

626
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:40,370
They might bring in
organizational
skills or military skills

627
00:28:40,501 --> 00:28:44,374
that can make a movement more
dangerous.

628
00:28:44,505 --> 00:28:46,246
All right,
form up and let's go.

629
00:28:47,508 --> 00:28:49,640
The second thing that's
disturbing however,

630
00:28:49,771 --> 00:28:54,123
is particularly in our society,
veterans have legitimacy.

631
00:28:54,254 --> 00:28:58,519
They have a particular
place of respect.

632
00:28:58,649 --> 00:29:01,435
And when we see veterans
involved in something,

633
00:29:01,565 --> 00:29:06,570
it gives some component of
legitimacy to that cause.

634
00:29:09,225 --> 00:29:12,228
Our command's been trying
to tell us to inform you that

635
00:29:12,359 --> 00:29:13,795
you are breaking
curfew right now.

636
00:29:13,926 --> 00:29:15,188
Yes sir.

637
00:29:15,318 --> 00:29:17,103
So if you could just
go back to your post

638
00:29:18,713 --> 00:29:21,368
not not by us, just by we
will have to enforce curfew.

639
00:29:23,631 --> 00:29:24,414
- Ten-four.
- Appreciate it.

640
00:29:24,545 --> 00:29:25,328
Copy that.

641
00:29:25,459 --> 00:29:26,765
Thank you so much.

642
00:29:31,857 --> 00:29:34,903
Veterans have a kind of
social cachet

643
00:29:35,034 --> 00:29:37,732
that provides cover for a
lot of the extremist activity

644
00:29:37,863 --> 00:29:39,995
that these groups
are trying to do.

645
00:29:40,126 --> 00:29:41,954
So if you turn out to a protest

646
00:29:42,084 --> 00:29:43,782
with a bunch of people in
uniform,

647
00:29:43,912 --> 00:29:46,480
much like if you turn out
with a bunch of women,

648
00:29:46,610 --> 00:29:48,308
you have a different
kind of reception

649
00:29:48,438 --> 00:29:51,354
than if you turn
out wearing say,

650
00:29:51,485 --> 00:29:54,575
swastikas and hoods and robes.

651
00:29:54,705 --> 00:29:56,185
So when we think about this,

652
00:29:56,316 --> 00:29:57,970
this is along the lines of
something like

653
00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:00,624
choosing to come out in
polo shirts and khakis,

654
00:30:00,755 --> 00:30:02,017
or choosing to come out

655
00:30:02,148 --> 00:30:04,890
in funny Hawaiian shirts
as part of Boogaloo.

656
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:07,327
Those are deliberate
decisions that are made

657
00:30:07,457 --> 00:30:10,721
to create the opportunity
for public reception.

658
00:30:10,852 --> 00:30:12,114
And the use of veterans

659
00:30:12,245 --> 00:30:15,378
is one way to do this,
among several.

660
00:30:15,509 --> 00:30:17,424
I've not been a part of
any militia beforehand,

661
00:30:17,554 --> 00:30:18,642
but once they opened up and said

662
00:30:18,773 --> 00:30:19,643
that they were
doing all this BLM,

663
00:30:19,774 --> 00:30:22,037
and I've seen my city on fire,

664
00:30:22,168 --> 00:30:23,430
I was just like,
I've had enough.

665
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:25,954
And so I reached out to
my local militia

666
00:30:27,042 --> 00:30:29,131
and I've been
with them ever since.

667
00:30:29,262 --> 00:30:30,785
Yeah, straight back.

668
00:30:30,916 --> 00:30:34,223
When you're vulnerable and
you're looking for family,

669
00:30:34,354 --> 00:30:37,139
'cause that's what the
people you serve with are,

670
00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:39,359
they look like they could be
family.

671
00:30:39,489 --> 00:30:43,624
They look like they can provide
you that sense of purpose,

672
00:30:43,754 --> 00:30:45,626
that mission, that camaraderie,

673
00:30:45,756 --> 00:30:47,976
that you had in the military,

674
00:30:48,107 --> 00:30:50,718
that you became dependent on,

675
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:54,940
that became the center of your
identity.

676
00:30:55,070 --> 00:30:57,333
They could give that back to
you.

677
00:30:59,727 --> 00:31:01,947
And when he tells you to
fight,

678
00:31:02,077 --> 00:31:04,906
you have no reason to question
that,

679
00:31:05,037 --> 00:31:09,998
because he's giving you purpose
and he's giving you mission.

680
00:31:15,961 --> 00:31:17,353
Yeah, yeah.

681
00:31:17,484 --> 00:31:20,095
We got our people across
the country making plans,

682
00:31:20,226 --> 00:31:21,444
but there's too many of us.

683
00:31:21,575 --> 00:31:22,793
There's too many veterans,
first of all,

684
00:31:22,924 --> 00:31:24,578
too many freaking military
veterans.

685
00:31:24,708 --> 00:31:25,884
That's one thing.

686
00:31:26,014 --> 00:31:27,798
I'm not a big fan of the War on
Terror

687
00:31:27,929 --> 00:31:29,278
what it did to a lot of our
rights.

688
00:31:29,409 --> 00:31:32,238
But one thing it did give
us is a massive pool,

689
00:31:32,368 --> 00:31:34,370
huge pool of combat veterans,

690
00:31:34,501 --> 00:31:38,679
and about 95% of them are
on the conservative side

691
00:31:38,809 --> 00:31:40,550
or are on the side of the
constitution.

692
00:31:41,595 --> 00:31:43,814
So it's not gonna play out very
well.

693
00:31:43,945 --> 00:31:46,730
[crowd shouting]

694
00:31:47,862 --> 00:31:50,734
And so when I look at January
6th,

695
00:31:50,865 --> 00:31:53,476
of course there were
people who did violence

696
00:31:53,607 --> 00:31:55,783
and climbed gates and caused
trouble.

697
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:58,264
But in my view, they were
likely the foot soldiers.

698
00:31:58,394 --> 00:32:02,746
They were the result of the
efforts of other people.

699
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:06,011
There's the man behind the
curtain pushing everybody out.

700
00:32:06,141 --> 00:32:07,490
You know these are the
half-cocked plans,

701
00:32:07,621 --> 00:32:08,883
the guys who go early.

702
00:32:09,014 --> 00:32:10,276
The people you really have to
worry about

703
00:32:10,406 --> 00:32:12,191
are the people you don't even
know exist

704
00:32:12,321 --> 00:32:14,715
until you're two years into the
conflict,

705
00:32:14,845 --> 00:32:17,457
'cause they're
tactically patient and
they're watching you.

706
00:32:17,587 --> 00:32:18,632
[Rioter] Oh my god.

707
00:32:18,762 --> 00:32:20,547
And I still am
absolutely stunned

708
00:32:20,677 --> 00:32:23,637
that people don't see how
awful January 6th was,

709
00:32:23,767 --> 00:32:27,032
and what an indicator that
is and how it's escalating.

710
00:32:27,162 --> 00:32:30,470
And anybody who says that this
can't happen in a worse way,

711
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:33,734
either they're ignorant or
they're part of the problem.

712
00:32:33,864 --> 00:32:35,344
Overran the capitol.

713
00:32:35,475 --> 00:32:37,607
We're in the fucking capitol, bro.

714
00:32:37,738 --> 00:32:40,697
People shouldn't look
at the insurrection

715
00:32:40,828 --> 00:32:43,439
at the capitol as an anomaly.

716
00:32:43,570 --> 00:32:46,529
We should pay attention to
the pattern that got us there.

717
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:52,927
[muffled speaking]

718
00:32:55,016 --> 00:32:56,800
[Klansman] In the name of
Jesus Christ,

719
00:32:56,931 --> 00:33:00,761
we light this cross, and
as light dispels darkness,

720
00:33:00,891 --> 00:33:02,893
so may his word and his example

721
00:33:03,024 --> 00:33:05,070
dispel the heathen
from our midst.

722
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,114
Amen.

723
00:33:06,245 --> 00:33:07,855
[All] Amen. Amen.

724
00:33:11,728 --> 00:33:15,732
[Klansman] By this
sign, you will conquer.

725
00:33:15,863 --> 00:33:17,256
White victory.

726
00:33:17,386 --> 00:33:18,474
[All] White victory.

727
00:33:18,605 --> 00:33:19,606
[Klansman] White power.

728
00:33:19,736 --> 00:33:21,042
[All] White power.

729
00:33:21,173 --> 00:33:22,522
[Klansman] We will fight.

730
00:33:22,652 --> 00:33:24,176
[All] We will fight.

731
00:33:24,306 --> 00:33:26,308
There is one American example

732
00:33:26,439 --> 00:33:28,397
of an extraordinarily
successful terrorist movement,

733
00:33:28,528 --> 00:33:29,920
and that is of course
the Ku Klux Klan.

734
00:33:31,966 --> 00:33:35,491
Many people in the Klan
talked about their experience

735
00:33:35,622 --> 00:33:37,711
as a continuation of warfare.

736
00:33:37,841 --> 00:33:40,322
The first wave came
after the Civil War,

737
00:33:40,453 --> 00:33:41,976
and here we saw
prominent veterans

738
00:33:42,107 --> 00:33:43,804
like Nathan Bedford Forrest,

739
00:33:43,934 --> 00:33:46,067
who rose to leadership
of that Klan.

740
00:33:46,981 --> 00:33:50,202
And although it started as a
veteran's social organization,

741
00:33:50,332 --> 00:33:53,205
it very quickly pivoted
to extralegal violence

742
00:33:53,335 --> 00:33:55,076
targeted at African Americans,

743
00:33:55,207 --> 00:33:58,340
which included night writings,
lynchings,

744
00:33:58,471 --> 00:34:00,908
serial rape, serial murder.

745
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:05,086
All of these things were
designed to create terror

746
00:34:05,217 --> 00:34:08,350
in African American communities
to control labor pools,

747
00:34:08,481 --> 00:34:09,830
to control local politics

748
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:12,311
and to keep African
Americans from the polls.

749
00:34:15,792 --> 00:34:18,360
One of the main parts
of the Jim Crow era

750
00:34:18,491 --> 00:34:20,014
was something that we would
think of today

751
00:34:20,145 --> 00:34:21,276
as election subversion.

752
00:34:21,407 --> 00:34:25,063
And we would see in states like
Georgia,

753
00:34:25,193 --> 00:34:28,849
where they refused to
seat 33 state legislators.

754
00:34:28,979 --> 00:34:33,027
We saw in states like Louisiana
where they refused to seat

755
00:34:33,158 --> 00:34:35,595
a duly elected
United States Senator,

756
00:34:35,725 --> 00:34:38,380
in North Carolina
where they held a coup

757
00:34:38,511 --> 00:34:42,558
to overthrow black
leadership in Wilmington.

758
00:34:43,516 --> 00:34:45,474
[Narrator] And in Mississippi
when winning elections

759
00:34:45,605 --> 00:34:48,782
by fraud and violence became
increasingly difficult,

760
00:34:48,912 --> 00:34:52,394
white politicians turned
to the state constitution.

761
00:34:52,525 --> 00:34:56,746
In 1890, Solomon Calhoon,
the conventions president

762
00:34:56,877 --> 00:34:59,097
gave delegates
their marching orders.

763
00:34:59,227 --> 00:35:01,751
"We came here
to exclude the Negro.

764
00:35:01,882 --> 00:35:04,754
Nothing short of
this will answer."

765
00:35:04,885 --> 00:35:06,713
The poll tax and literacy tests

766
00:35:06,843 --> 00:35:08,845
that were written into
Mississippi law

767
00:35:08,976 --> 00:35:11,544
were so effective at
keeping blacks from voting,

768
00:35:11,674 --> 00:35:14,024
that Calhoon's strategy became
a model

769
00:35:14,155 --> 00:35:15,722
for the rest of the South,

770
00:35:15,852 --> 00:35:19,204
staying in place for
almost another century.

771
00:35:19,334 --> 00:35:23,077
The Klan managed to keep
African Americans from voting

772
00:35:23,208 --> 00:35:24,731
for 100 years.

773
00:35:24,861 --> 00:35:27,603
That is an astonishing
political success.

774
00:35:27,734 --> 00:35:30,954
And it happened because the
Klan was politically powerful,

775
00:35:31,085 --> 00:35:34,219
really well connected, largely
in the Democratic party,

776
00:35:34,349 --> 00:35:35,829
not just in the South.

777
00:35:35,959 --> 00:35:40,616
And was able to establish
itself as a counter power

778
00:35:41,008 --> 00:35:44,403
that would stop the
emergence of new voters,

779
00:35:44,533 --> 00:35:47,057
whether those voters were
blacks or indeed Catholics,

780
00:35:47,188 --> 00:35:49,843
who they didn't see as
genuinely American.

781
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:53,455
[Narrator] The next and most
politically effective wave

782
00:35:53,586 --> 00:35:56,937
of KKK activity came after
World War I.

783
00:35:59,244 --> 00:36:02,029
[trumpet music]

784
00:36:03,596 --> 00:36:06,773
The second Klan that emerges
after Birth of a Nation,

785
00:36:06,903 --> 00:36:10,733
a movie that really changes
the perception of the Klan,

786
00:36:10,864 --> 00:36:14,302
that Woodrow Wilson as President
screens in the White House,

787
00:36:14,433 --> 00:36:18,132
allows a new media savvy

788
00:36:18,263 --> 00:36:21,309
extremist movement to emerge.

789
00:36:22,484 --> 00:36:25,226
And this is when you really
saw the group take off,

790
00:36:25,357 --> 00:36:27,489
not just in the South but
nationwide.

791
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:29,404
This is the clan that reached a
membership

792
00:36:29,535 --> 00:36:33,365
of some 4 million people and
10% of the state of Indiana.

793
00:36:33,495 --> 00:36:34,888
They were parading in public

794
00:36:35,018 --> 00:36:37,673
on the National Mall in
Washington, DC.

795
00:36:37,804 --> 00:36:39,458
And the founder of that
organization

796
00:36:39,588 --> 00:36:42,069
had been a veteran of
the Spanish-American War.

797
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:45,899
It comes to a head in 1924.

798
00:36:46,029 --> 00:36:48,336
The Democratic Party has a
convention

799
00:36:48,467 --> 00:36:49,903
at Madison Square Garden,

800
00:36:50,033 --> 00:36:53,123
and the Ku Klux Klan decides
that it's going to stop

801
00:36:53,254 --> 00:36:55,865
the Democratic Party from
condemning Klan violence.

802
00:36:55,996 --> 00:36:58,041
And they pretty much take over
the party,

803
00:36:58,172 --> 00:37:01,610
and make sure that it is
running on their agenda.

804
00:37:01,741 --> 00:37:03,525
Now, if you want
the optimistic story,

805
00:37:03,656 --> 00:37:05,788
four years later the
Democratic party changes.

806
00:37:05,919 --> 00:37:07,703
If you want the pessimistic
story,

807
00:37:07,834 --> 00:37:10,880
a major political party
gets co-opted and taken over

808
00:37:11,011 --> 00:37:14,406
by a violent insurrectionist
terrorist movement.

809
00:37:15,581 --> 00:37:17,800
[Narrator] The KKK's grip
on the Democratic Party

810
00:37:17,931 --> 00:37:20,803
soon ended, but nearly 100
years later

811
00:37:20,934 --> 00:37:24,894
attempts to subvert free
and fair elections have not.

812
00:37:25,765 --> 00:37:27,332
[Caller] You rigged my
fucking election,

813
00:37:27,462 --> 00:37:29,899
you fucking piece of shit.

814
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:32,641
We're gonna try you and
we're gonna hang you.

815
00:37:33,512 --> 00:37:36,515
We're talking about 50
and 60 year old ladies

816
00:37:36,645 --> 00:37:38,168
that are just,

817
00:37:38,299 --> 00:37:40,475
that've just been working
elections their whole life,

818
00:37:40,606 --> 00:37:47,177
or respected leaders on both
sides that are being inundated

819
00:37:47,308 --> 00:37:48,788
with some of
the worst types of threats

820
00:37:48,918 --> 00:37:50,050
that you can imagine.

821
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:51,007
[News Reporter] You and your
family

822
00:37:51,138 --> 00:37:52,879
will be killed very slowly.

823
00:37:53,009 --> 00:37:55,838
The death threats came by
text to Tricia Rothenberger,

824
00:37:55,969 --> 00:37:57,927
wife of Georgia
Secretary of State,

825
00:37:58,058 --> 00:37:59,886
as Trump attacked him
incessantly

826
00:38:00,016 --> 00:38:02,062
for standing by the
election results in Georgia.

827
00:38:02,192 --> 00:38:04,020
He's an enemy of the people.

828
00:38:04,151 --> 00:38:07,720
Intimidation is a form
of voter suppression,

829
00:38:07,850 --> 00:38:10,810
and goes hand in hand
with election subversion,

830
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:12,115
both in our history and today.

831
00:38:12,246 --> 00:38:14,030
They're trying to rig an
election

832
00:38:14,161 --> 00:38:15,380
and we can't let that happen.

833
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:17,120
I hope you're all gonna be poll
watchers.

834
00:38:17,251 --> 00:38:18,296
Morning, here to vote?

835
00:38:18,426 --> 00:38:20,820
The entire poll watching
program

836
00:38:20,950 --> 00:38:21,864
for the Trump campaign,

837
00:38:21,995 --> 00:38:23,562
was called Army for Trump.

838
00:38:23,692 --> 00:38:26,608
We need every able-bodied
man, woman,

839
00:38:26,739 --> 00:38:31,178
to join Army for Trump's
election security operation.

840
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:32,571
The underlying narrative,

841
00:38:32,701 --> 00:38:34,921
the messages that were pushed
were one of,

842
00:38:35,051 --> 00:38:39,055
we need to go protect
and stop fraud

843
00:38:39,186 --> 00:38:40,535
from coming into our elections.

844
00:38:40,666 --> 00:38:44,409
It was a very militaristic
campaign.

845
00:38:44,539 --> 00:38:46,759
[Narrator] To increase its
operational effectiveness,

846
00:38:46,889 --> 00:38:50,197
Trump's army enlisted
groups like True the Vote,

847
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:52,634
which had many veterans within
its ranks.

848
00:38:52,765 --> 00:38:54,157
As a veteran,

849
00:38:54,288 --> 00:38:56,856
we're sworn to support and
defend the constitution.

850
00:38:56,986 --> 00:38:59,859
My brothers and I were
willing to shed our blood

851
00:38:59,989 --> 00:39:01,295
on the battlefield

852
00:39:01,426 --> 00:39:04,298
to protect the beliefs of the
Iraqi people

853
00:39:04,429 --> 00:39:05,517
so they can vote.

854
00:39:05,647 --> 00:39:07,388
So I'm asking you as Americans

855
00:39:07,519 --> 00:39:08,998
to take involvement
in this vote.

856
00:39:09,129 --> 00:39:11,827
The idea that military
service entitles you

857
00:39:11,958 --> 00:39:15,048
to talk about protecting the
constitution is a real problem,

858
00:39:15,178 --> 00:39:17,616
because it gives a level of
justification

859
00:39:17,746 --> 00:39:19,835
these groups do not deserve
and have not earned.

860
00:39:19,966 --> 00:39:21,533
If you have any information
about

861
00:39:21,663 --> 00:39:24,579
ballot harvesting in your
state, go to True the Vote.

862
00:39:24,710 --> 00:39:27,365
It's called truethevote.org.

863
00:39:27,495 --> 00:39:31,020
And I'm sure a lot of people
in this audience saw plenty.

864
00:39:31,151 --> 00:39:33,632
If there's always this
underlying belief

865
00:39:33,762 --> 00:39:37,810
that people are trying to game
this system in an unfair way,

866
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:40,334
then regardless of the
intent of the people

867
00:39:40,465 --> 00:39:42,728
that are brought into that
system,

868
00:39:42,858 --> 00:39:46,601
that default will always be
there, to police that vote.

869
00:39:46,732 --> 00:39:48,124
And we know that that's going
to have

870
00:39:48,255 --> 00:39:51,171
a disproportionate impact
on communities of color.

871
00:39:51,301 --> 00:39:52,912
[Texas GOP Official] We're
trying to build an army here

872
00:39:53,042 --> 00:39:56,002
that will have the
confidence and courage

873
00:39:56,132 --> 00:39:58,831
to come down in here
in these areas

874
00:39:58,961 --> 00:40:02,008
where we really
need poll workers.

875
00:40:02,138 --> 00:40:04,576
'Cause this is where
the fraud is occurring.

876
00:40:04,706 --> 00:40:06,534
You know, those areas
that he was pointing out.

877
00:40:06,665 --> 00:40:09,972
There are no allegations
of any sort of voter fraud

878
00:40:10,103 --> 00:40:13,759
or shenanigans taking
place there in 2020 at all.

879
00:40:13,889 --> 00:40:16,762
The only thing that's known
is that black and brown people

880
00:40:16,892 --> 00:40:18,764
vote heavily in those areas.

881
00:40:19,808 --> 00:40:20,853
[Narrator] Harris County,

882
00:40:20,983 --> 00:40:22,202
like the rest of
the United States,

883
00:40:22,332 --> 00:40:24,596
has seen its percentage of
white residents

884
00:40:24,726 --> 00:40:26,424
decrease dramatically.

885
00:40:26,554 --> 00:40:29,165
50 years ago, white Americans
made up

886
00:40:29,296 --> 00:40:32,342
more than 80% of the US
population.

887
00:40:32,473 --> 00:40:36,303
By 2044 they will be in the
minority.

888
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:39,524
The demographic change
of the United States

889
00:40:39,654 --> 00:40:42,222
away from being a white
majority country

890
00:40:42,352 --> 00:40:45,399
towards a multiracial nation
and a multicultural nation

891
00:40:45,530 --> 00:40:47,706
is what moves it from simply,

892
00:40:47,836 --> 00:40:50,273
aha, my community is becoming
multiracial

893
00:40:50,404 --> 00:40:53,015
and our politics will
change because of this,

894
00:40:53,146 --> 00:40:57,063
to we have to stop this
because if people can vote

895
00:40:57,193 --> 00:40:59,065
and exercise their rights,

896
00:40:59,195 --> 00:41:02,024
the white majority will be
imperiled.

897
00:41:03,025 --> 00:41:04,287
And everywhere I turn,

898
00:41:05,114 --> 00:41:08,161
I have been hearing from my
constituents,

899
00:41:08,291 --> 00:41:10,119
they are deeply worried.

900
00:41:10,250 --> 00:41:11,817
They know their history.

901
00:41:13,296 --> 00:41:15,473
They are witnessing what is
happening

902
00:41:16,430 --> 00:41:18,737
to our democracy in real time.

903
00:41:18,867 --> 00:41:21,087
[Narrator] In the aftermath
of the 2020 election,

904
00:41:21,217 --> 00:41:25,091
Republican legislatures in
Georgia and 18 other states

905
00:41:25,221 --> 00:41:26,832
passed a slew of laws

906
00:41:26,962 --> 00:41:29,487
that limited access to the
ballot box.

907
00:41:29,617 --> 00:41:31,967
But what is even more
disconcerting

908
00:41:32,098 --> 00:41:35,580
is that these politicians
in the state legislature

909
00:41:35,710 --> 00:41:37,538
have already laid the tracks

910
00:41:37,669 --> 00:41:41,455
to take over local
boards of elections.

911
00:41:41,586 --> 00:41:43,239
Control the count.

912
00:41:43,370 --> 00:41:45,328
We can get to the same place

913
00:41:45,459 --> 00:41:48,375
through bureaucratic
violence, as some would say,

914
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:52,858
as we can get to through actual
violence and intimidation.

915
00:41:52,988 --> 00:41:55,600
And when you marry those two,

916
00:41:55,730 --> 00:41:59,647
then you are in a unique
era of suppression

917
00:41:59,778 --> 00:42:01,301
and anti-democratic efforts.

918
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:14,357
[muffled speaking]

919
00:42:14,488 --> 00:42:15,663
Heavenly Father, we thank you

920
00:42:15,794 --> 00:42:18,623
for this wonderful
gathering of people

921
00:42:18,753 --> 00:42:20,538
that's come this
afternoon, Lord,

922
00:42:20,668 --> 00:42:23,845
to celebrate this
grassroot campaign

923
00:42:23,976 --> 00:42:26,413
of keeping America great.

924
00:42:26,544 --> 00:42:28,981
We know that
there's groups today

925
00:42:29,111 --> 00:42:33,115
that have brought havoc to our
great cities across America.

926
00:42:33,246 --> 00:42:35,857
This militant Marxist groups,
Lord,

927
00:42:35,988 --> 00:42:39,121
that would destroy us
from being a greatness.

928
00:42:39,252 --> 00:42:40,253
I pray against them.

929
00:42:40,383 --> 00:42:42,560
Holy Spirit in Jesus name.

930
00:42:42,690 --> 00:42:44,910
And everybody said
a big old Amen.

931
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:46,128
[All] Amen.

932
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:50,829
You joyful warriors
and patriots have watched

933
00:42:50,959 --> 00:42:53,483
as your tyrannical
governments have separated you

934
00:42:53,614 --> 00:42:55,834
from your churches,
from your schools,

935
00:42:55,964 --> 00:42:57,444
from your prosperity, right,

936
00:42:57,575 --> 00:43:00,186
from your families,
from your businesses.

937
00:43:00,316 --> 00:43:03,842
But now you can fight back,
'cause that's what we do.

938
00:43:03,972 --> 00:43:05,583
We fight back.

939
00:43:05,713 --> 00:43:08,020
[audience applauding]
[person yelling]

940
00:43:08,150 --> 00:43:10,283
How many veterans
I got in here?

941
00:43:10,413 --> 00:43:12,198
Let me hear you shout.

942
00:43:12,328 --> 00:43:14,417
[audience shouting]

943
00:43:14,548 --> 00:43:17,246
They're trying to make
us a socialist country.

944
00:43:19,553 --> 00:43:23,339
Maybe they're trying to
make us a communist country.

945
00:43:23,470 --> 00:43:25,515
I am deadly serious.

946
00:43:25,646 --> 00:43:27,648
The next three years
is gonna determine

947
00:43:27,779 --> 00:43:29,432
whether we remain
a free country.

948
00:43:29,563 --> 00:43:32,000
That's why, all over America,

949
00:43:32,131 --> 00:43:34,960
we need people like Eric,
particularly in the Senate.

950
00:43:35,090 --> 00:43:38,093
[audience cheering]

951
00:43:41,706 --> 00:43:43,969
Mayor Giuliani's never
stopped fighting.

952
00:43:44,099 --> 00:43:45,971
He's still on the front lines.

953
00:43:46,101 --> 00:43:48,582
And the day after the election,
he said, you know what?

954
00:43:48,713 --> 00:43:50,584
We got some serious
irregularities here.

955
00:43:50,715 --> 00:43:52,107
We need to look into this fraud.

956
00:43:52,238 --> 00:43:54,022
And what did you hear
from the mainstream media

957
00:43:54,153 --> 00:43:55,197
over and over again?

958
00:43:55,328 --> 00:43:56,938
They said,
oh, that's just crazy.

959
00:43:57,069 --> 00:43:58,548
You can't do that.

960
00:43:58,679 --> 00:44:00,899
You can't say that there's
any fraud in the election.

961
00:44:01,029 --> 00:44:04,380
Well, I'm proud to tell you
I'm the only person in this race

962
00:44:04,511 --> 00:44:07,296
from Missouri who went
down to the front lines

963
00:44:07,427 --> 00:44:08,689
in Arizona myself,

964
00:44:08,820 --> 00:44:10,517
to look at the election audit,

965
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:13,694
and they need to audit the
whole election.

966
00:44:13,825 --> 00:44:17,480
They need to audit the whole
election.

967
00:44:17,611 --> 00:44:19,831
[Narrator] Eric Greitens
is a highly decorated

968
00:44:19,961 --> 00:44:22,529
former Navy Seal
and a Rhodes Scholar.

969
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:25,880
He grew up as a Democrat and
after leaving the service,

970
00:44:26,011 --> 00:44:29,057
wrote several bestselling
books about humanitarianism.

971
00:44:29,188 --> 00:44:31,669
"Strength and Compassion" is
a book

972
00:44:31,799 --> 00:44:34,846
of photographs and essays from
eight different countries,

973
00:44:34,976 --> 00:44:36,978
where I did international
humanitarian work

974
00:44:37,109 --> 00:44:38,806
and documentary photography.

975
00:44:38,937 --> 00:44:40,547
[Narrator] He also co-founded

976
00:44:40,678 --> 00:44:43,898
the influential veteran
nonprofit,
The Mission Continues.

977
00:44:44,029 --> 00:44:45,421
While everybody's home
sleeping,

978
00:44:45,552 --> 00:44:46,422
we're out here working.

979
00:44:46,553 --> 00:44:47,772
The mission continues, baby.

980
00:44:47,902 --> 00:44:49,338
Our belief that The Mission
Continues

981
00:44:49,469 --> 00:44:51,297
was that every single
veteran who was coming home

982
00:44:51,427 --> 00:44:53,473
was an asset and that
they could all live lives

983
00:44:53,603 --> 00:44:55,736
of purpose and dignity
and meaning here at home.

984
00:44:55,867 --> 00:44:57,433
[Narrator] In 2015, he became

985
00:44:57,564 --> 00:44:59,740
the Republican governor of
Missouri,

986
00:44:59,871 --> 00:45:02,003
but resigned less
than two years later

987
00:45:02,134 --> 00:45:05,441
in the wake of a sex
and fundraising scandal.

988
00:45:05,572 --> 00:45:09,315
In 2021, he began his
campaign for the US Senate.

989
00:45:09,445 --> 00:45:11,709
When I took the oath to serve

990
00:45:11,839 --> 00:45:13,885
in the United States military,

991
00:45:14,015 --> 00:45:18,541
I took an oath to
defend the constitution

992
00:45:18,672 --> 00:45:24,634
against all enemies,
foreign and domestic.

993
00:45:25,113 --> 00:45:26,114
And domestic.

994
00:45:27,072 --> 00:45:29,901
[audience applauding]

995
00:45:30,031 --> 00:45:32,904
And folks, let's be clear,

996
00:45:33,034 --> 00:45:36,385
we have a fight on our
hands for this country.

997
00:45:36,516 --> 00:45:39,737
And we are here to let
the mainstream media know,

998
00:45:39,867 --> 00:45:42,696
and let the left know, and
the establishment know,

999
00:45:42,827 --> 00:45:44,480
and let the RINOs know,

1000
00:45:44,611 --> 00:45:47,832
that we are going to win, and
we're taking back our country.

1001
00:45:47,962 --> 00:45:52,314
[audience applauding and
cheering]

1002
00:45:53,402 --> 00:45:55,927
This is our country and
we're taking it back.

1003
00:45:56,057 --> 00:46:00,888
[audience applauding and
cheering]

1004
00:46:01,019 --> 00:46:05,545
There's a cadre of Iraq
and Afghanistan era veterans

1005
00:46:05,675 --> 00:46:09,984
who were trained in elite
military units,

1006
00:46:10,115 --> 00:46:11,812
who went to elite schools.

1007
00:46:11,943 --> 00:46:14,249
A Plus, we're with you all
the way.

1008
00:46:14,380 --> 00:46:16,904
Who know better.

1009
00:46:17,035 --> 00:46:21,387
And over the last few years
have seen Trump's rise to power,

1010
00:46:21,517 --> 00:46:23,693
and rather than
be disgusted by it,

1011
00:46:23,824 --> 00:46:26,566
because it goes against
all of our values,

1012
00:46:26,696 --> 00:46:29,090
they don't live by those values.

1013
00:46:29,221 --> 00:46:30,570
[Charlie] And you went from
high school to the Marines?

1014
00:46:30,700 --> 00:46:32,790
Yeah, the great thing
about the Marine Corps

1015
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:35,227
is that they really
force you to shape up.

1016
00:46:35,357 --> 00:46:38,317
I like to describe it as a
four-year character education,

1017
00:46:38,447 --> 00:46:41,711
because they teach you not
just how to iron a uniform,

1018
00:46:41,842 --> 00:46:43,061
but they teach you about
financial management.

1019
00:46:43,191 --> 00:46:44,714
They teach you
how to make your bed.

1020
00:46:44,845 --> 00:46:46,412
They teach you
a lot of the skillsets

1021
00:46:46,542 --> 00:46:49,023
that you need to be a
successful adult.

1022
00:46:49,154 --> 00:46:51,243
[Narrator] JD Vance is a
former Marine.

1023
00:46:51,373 --> 00:46:55,073
Like Stewart Rhodes, he
graduated from Yale Law School.

1024
00:46:55,203 --> 00:46:56,335
And like Eric Greitens,

1025
00:46:56,465 --> 00:46:57,771
he's a best-selling author

1026
00:46:57,902 --> 00:47:00,469
who was once a darling
of the New York Times.

1027
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:03,516
[Interviewer]
Are there commonalities
between poor whites,

1028
00:47:03,646 --> 00:47:05,561
poor blacks, poor Latinos?

1029
00:47:05,692 --> 00:47:07,302
Absolutely, there are
things that are shared

1030
00:47:07,433 --> 00:47:09,435
across different groups.

1031
00:47:09,565 --> 00:47:12,220
And I think that we should
take some inspiration from it,

1032
00:47:12,351 --> 00:47:15,745
some recognition that we are
sort of in this together.

1033
00:47:15,876 --> 00:47:18,836
[Narrator] In 2016, he
called Donald Trump an idiot.

1034
00:47:18,966 --> 00:47:20,315
I'm a never Trump guy.

1035
00:47:20,446 --> 00:47:21,447
I never liked him.

1036
00:47:21,577 --> 00:47:22,665
[Narrator] And suggested

1037
00:47:22,796 --> 00:47:24,102
that he could be
an American Hitler.

1038
00:47:24,232 --> 00:47:25,538
But four years later,

1039
00:47:25,668 --> 00:47:28,367
he changed his tune when
he launched his campaign

1040
00:47:28,497 --> 00:47:29,890
for Ohio's senate seat.

1041
00:47:30,021 --> 00:47:31,065
I wasn't always nice,

1042
00:47:31,196 --> 00:47:32,588
but the simple fact is

1043
00:47:32,719 --> 00:47:35,243
he's the best president
of my lifetime.

1044
00:47:35,374 --> 00:47:37,680
And he revealed the
corruption in this country

1045
00:47:37,811 --> 00:47:39,334
like nobody else.

1046
00:47:39,465 --> 00:47:40,945
JD Vance a few years ago,

1047
00:47:41,075 --> 00:47:43,948
I think a lot of people
across the political spectrum

1048
00:47:44,078 --> 00:47:45,384
had a lot of respect for him.

1049
00:47:45,514 --> 00:47:48,387
But now we see him
pretending to be an idiot.

1050
00:47:48,517 --> 00:47:50,302
Are you a racist?

1051
00:47:50,432 --> 00:47:51,694
Do you hate Mexicans?

1052
00:47:51,825 --> 00:47:52,870
I think it's ridiculous that
we're focused

1053
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,220
on this border in Ukraine.

1054
00:47:56,134 --> 00:47:57,048
I gotta be honest with you,

1055
00:47:57,178 --> 00:47:58,136
I don't really care what happens

1056
00:47:58,266 --> 00:47:59,659
to Ukraine one way or another.

1057
00:47:59,789 --> 00:48:01,966
A guy like Eric Greitens
or a guy like JD Vance,

1058
00:48:02,096 --> 00:48:06,187
they didn't internalize any of
the morals

1059
00:48:06,318 --> 00:48:09,408
that are supposed
to be instilled in us
during our training.

1060
00:48:09,538 --> 00:48:14,021
Things like valor and
honor and respect.

1061
00:48:14,152 --> 00:48:16,763
[guns firing]

1062
00:48:22,638 --> 00:48:24,945
They understand
when they're lying.

1063
00:48:25,076 --> 00:48:28,557
They understand when
they're fueling hatred.

1064
00:48:28,688 --> 00:48:30,081
I say it all the time, right?

1065
00:48:30,211 --> 00:48:31,691
I think the election
was stolen from Trump.

1066
00:48:31,821 --> 00:48:33,606
And technology
companies would not let us

1067
00:48:33,736 --> 00:48:35,173
talk about the fact
that Joe Biden

1068
00:48:35,303 --> 00:48:37,610
is the leader of the world's
biggest crime family.

1069
00:48:37,740 --> 00:48:40,526
And they recognize
that they need to do it

1070
00:48:40,656 --> 00:48:42,093
in order to achieve power.

1071
00:48:42,223 --> 00:48:44,008
Part of the problem for
the young veteran too,

1072
00:48:44,138 --> 00:48:46,053
is that some of these
manipulative voices

1073
00:48:46,184 --> 00:48:49,013
are former high ranking
military leaders.

1074
00:48:49,143 --> 00:48:51,319
General Michael Flynn.

1075
00:48:51,450 --> 00:48:54,279
[crowd cheering]

1076
00:48:55,845 --> 00:48:58,413
So when you hear somebody
who held sway over you

1077
00:48:58,544 --> 00:48:59,719
when you were in uniform,

1078
00:48:59,849 --> 00:49:00,589
and now they're out
and they're still

1079
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:02,200
commanding that respect,

1080
00:49:02,330 --> 00:49:04,463
that has just such a strong
purpose.

1081
00:49:04,593 --> 00:49:05,855
Trump won.

1082
00:49:09,598 --> 00:49:10,686
He won.

1083
00:49:10,817 --> 00:49:13,689
[crowd cheering]

1084
00:49:17,824 --> 00:49:21,697
He won the popular vote,
he won the popular vote,

1085
00:49:21,828 --> 00:49:24,091
and he won the electoral
college vote.

1086
00:49:24,222 --> 00:49:26,702
Ah, you know,
Flynn's a character.

1087
00:49:26,833 --> 00:49:28,661
He's something special.

1088
00:49:28,791 --> 00:49:30,184
It comes a little bit
from the comradery

1089
00:49:30,315 --> 00:49:31,446
of being a military person.

1090
00:49:31,577 --> 00:49:33,492
I can look at Flynn and I can
see that

1091
00:49:33,622 --> 00:49:38,279
he's got some really, really
deep love for this country

1092
00:49:38,410 --> 00:49:39,324
and respect for it.

1093
00:49:39,454 --> 00:49:41,195
And he does respect his oath.

1094
00:49:41,326 --> 00:49:43,981
I am not a
conspiracy theorist.

1095
00:49:44,111 --> 00:49:47,506
I base my life on facts and
judgment,

1096
00:49:47,636 --> 00:49:50,161
and what I believe is
right for this country,

1097
00:49:50,291 --> 00:49:51,989
for this country, period.

1098
00:49:52,119 --> 00:49:55,035
Flynn has been exposing
truth left and right,

1099
00:49:55,166 --> 00:49:56,428
and that's what makes
him one of the most

1100
00:49:56,558 --> 00:49:57,995
dangerous men in America.

1101
00:49:58,952 --> 00:50:00,693
[Narrator]
Michael Flynn is a retired

1102
00:50:00,823 --> 00:50:03,087
US Army three star general.

1103
00:50:03,217 --> 00:50:05,437
His specialty was
military intelligence.

1104
00:50:05,567 --> 00:50:06,742
Is it trusted?

1105
00:50:06,873 --> 00:50:09,745
The intelligence
community wants to

1106
00:50:09,876 --> 00:50:12,618
validate the sources of
information that we have

1107
00:50:12,748 --> 00:50:17,057
in order to ensure that it's
believable, reliable, relevant.

1108
00:50:17,188 --> 00:50:19,842
[Narrator] And the teams he
led were notoriously effective

1109
00:50:19,973 --> 00:50:23,324
in rooting out insurgencies
in Iraq and Afghanistan

1110
00:50:23,455 --> 00:50:24,804
for over a decade.

1111
00:50:24,934 --> 00:50:27,763
In 2012, he was nominated
by Barack Obama

1112
00:50:27,894 --> 00:50:30,853
to be the Director of the
Defense Intelligence Agency.

1113
00:50:30,984 --> 00:50:33,117
Mike Flynn brings
to this position

1114
00:50:33,247 --> 00:50:36,424
decades of experience in
military intelligence.

1115
00:50:37,512 --> 00:50:40,080
His knowledge of the
21st century battlefield

1116
00:50:40,211 --> 00:50:41,212
is unsurpassed.

1117
00:50:41,342 --> 00:50:42,691
[audience applauding]

1118
00:50:42,822 --> 00:50:43,866
[Narrator]
But three years later,

1119
00:50:43,997 --> 00:50:46,043
the one-time
Democrat had become

1120
00:50:46,173 --> 00:50:49,524
an avid supporter
of candidate Trump.

1121
00:50:49,655 --> 00:50:52,745
Lock her up, that's right.

1122
00:50:52,875 --> 00:50:55,008
Yeah, that's right,
lock her up.

1123
00:50:55,139 --> 00:50:56,444
[Narrator]
And would soon become

1124
00:50:56,575 --> 00:50:59,491
President Trump's
National Security Advisor.

1125
00:50:59,621 --> 00:51:02,059
But just 22 days into his term,

1126
00:51:02,189 --> 00:51:03,712
Trump fired him for lying

1127
00:51:03,843 --> 00:51:05,845
about his interactions
with Russia.

1128
00:51:05,975 --> 00:51:07,977
The evolving and eroding
level of trust

1129
00:51:08,108 --> 00:51:09,805
as a result of this situation,

1130
00:51:09,936 --> 00:51:11,677
is what led the President

1131
00:51:11,807 --> 00:51:14,767
to ask for General Flynn's
resignation.

1132
00:51:14,897 --> 00:51:16,290
[Narrator] And General Flynn
would soon

1133
00:51:16,421 --> 00:51:18,945
enter a plea deal with the FBI.

1134
00:51:19,076 --> 00:51:22,688
His prison sentence was under
review when Trump pardoned him

1135
00:51:22,818 --> 00:51:27,562
in December, 2020, less than
a month before leaving office.

1136
00:51:29,434 --> 00:51:31,523
Mike Flynn and I served
together for many years,

1137
00:51:31,653 --> 00:51:33,829
and were very close friends.

1138
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:37,790
I disagree with him politically.

1139
00:51:38,573 --> 00:51:41,924
I am disappointed

1140
00:51:42,055 --> 00:51:46,320
by the nature of the
comments that he makes,

1141
00:51:46,451 --> 00:51:47,843
the calls to action.

1142
00:51:47,974 --> 00:51:50,107
This is one of our top
quality guns.

1143
00:51:53,849 --> 00:51:56,504
[all laughing]

1144
00:51:58,289 --> 00:52:02,206
Disgraced former General
Michael Flynn, convicted felon.

1145
00:52:02,336 --> 00:52:05,905
He uses General like
it's his first name.

1146
00:52:06,035 --> 00:52:07,385
I'm his Facebook friend.

1147
00:52:07,515 --> 00:52:09,865
His Facebook name is Gen Flynn.

1148
00:52:10,823 --> 00:52:13,130
On Telegram, he's General Flynn.

1149
00:52:14,957 --> 00:52:17,525
He's using his rank as
part of his identity.

1150
00:52:17,656 --> 00:52:21,964
And he has adopted the
radical fascist politics

1151
00:52:22,095 --> 00:52:24,619
of MAGA and of QAnon.

1152
00:52:24,750 --> 00:52:26,055
Where we go one, we go all.

1153
00:52:26,186 --> 00:52:27,709
Where we go one, we go all.

1154
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:29,320
God bless America.

1155
00:52:29,450 --> 00:52:33,802
To build himself up as
a leader for an insurgency

1156
00:52:33,933 --> 00:52:35,456
against the people of the
United States.

1157
00:52:35,587 --> 00:52:37,241
This country is awake.

1158
00:52:37,371 --> 00:52:39,373
This is soil that we have
fought over

1159
00:52:39,504 --> 00:52:41,462
and we will fight for in the
future.

1160
00:52:41,593 --> 00:52:43,682
He could take military
capabilities

1161
00:52:43,812 --> 00:52:45,423
and he could place 'em
in those states,

1162
00:52:45,553 --> 00:52:48,469
and basically rerun an election
in each of those states.

1163
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:52,386
Clearly his military
experience
influences some people

1164
00:52:52,517 --> 00:52:56,390
to give him legitimacy that
he might not otherwise have.

1165
00:53:07,401 --> 00:53:09,186
No reason,
I mean it should happen,

1166
00:53:09,316 --> 00:53:10,926
No reason, that's right.

1167
00:53:11,057 --> 00:53:12,276
[Narrator]
Flynn's apparent endorsement

1168
00:53:12,406 --> 00:53:13,581
of a military coup

1169
00:53:13,712 --> 00:53:14,974
is not the only time

1170
00:53:15,104 --> 00:53:17,368
the former military
intelligence officer

1171
00:53:17,498 --> 00:53:20,066
has planted ideas about the
illegitimacy

1172
00:53:20,197 --> 00:53:23,287
of the federal government
and its partners in crime.

1173
00:53:23,417 --> 00:53:25,593
Well he doesn't need any
introduction

1174
00:53:25,724 --> 00:53:28,379
on this Friday,
January 28th broadcast.

1175
00:53:28,509 --> 00:53:31,947
He's General Flynn and of
course a embattled individual

1176
00:53:32,078 --> 00:53:34,036
in the fight for this republic.

1177
00:53:34,167 --> 00:53:36,169
All these global
organizations,

1178
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:37,910
they see themselves as,

1179
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:40,391
this is how we can control
societies.

1180
00:53:40,521 --> 00:53:42,480
This is how we can control
humanity.

1181
00:53:42,610 --> 00:53:45,831
So let's introduce something
called COVID.

1182
00:53:45,961 --> 00:53:48,399
And they did it and they did
it for a couple of reasons.

1183
00:53:48,529 --> 00:53:50,879
One of the big reasons was
was to steal an election.

1184
00:53:51,010 --> 00:53:53,969
They have an intent to
have a new world order.

1185
00:53:54,100 --> 00:53:57,408
They have an intent to track
every single one of us.

1186
00:53:57,538 --> 00:53:59,018
And they use it under the skin.

1187
00:53:59,148 --> 00:54:01,194
They use a means by which
it's under the skin.

1188
00:54:01,325 --> 00:54:04,371
Dr. Fauci would be right
in there in the same room

1189
00:54:04,502 --> 00:54:07,113
with people like Dr. Mengele
and Dr. Zell,

1190
00:54:07,244 --> 00:54:10,159
who worked for the
Nazis at the time of

1191
00:54:11,204 --> 00:54:13,815
all of Hitler's experimentation
on human beings.

1192
00:54:13,946 --> 00:54:17,036
The reality is, as you
learn the ability to lead,

1193
00:54:17,166 --> 00:54:18,429
whether it's military or not,

1194
00:54:18,559 --> 00:54:21,432
you learn the ability to
get people to do stuff.

1195
00:54:21,562 --> 00:54:23,129
And that's just
what he's doing.

1196
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:26,263
We are in a crucible
moment in the history

1197
00:54:26,393 --> 00:54:28,047
of the United States of America.

1198
00:54:28,177 --> 00:54:29,483
We're fighting with faith,

1199
00:54:29,614 --> 00:54:31,050
we're fighting with courage,

1200
00:54:31,180 --> 00:54:33,748
and nothing can resist
the power of prayer.

1201
00:54:33,879 --> 00:54:36,664
He perverts this military
experience,

1202
00:54:36,795 --> 00:54:39,276
this religious experience

1203
00:54:39,406 --> 00:54:43,628
to evoke this kind of
feeling of a higher purpose.

1204
00:54:43,758 --> 00:54:47,458
The oppression that they
have used with this virus

1205
00:54:47,588 --> 00:54:50,025
is an abomination to freedom.

1206
00:54:51,853 --> 00:54:54,291
There is no righteousness
on their side.

1207
00:54:54,421 --> 00:54:58,730
The Lord is not on their
side, he is on ours.

1208
00:55:00,732 --> 00:55:01,950
[Audience Member] That's
right.

1209
00:55:02,081 --> 00:55:06,868
We will not go silently
in to the night.

1210
00:55:08,392 --> 00:55:09,741
We will fight.

1211
00:55:10,655 --> 00:55:14,702
We are making our lists and
we are checking them twice.

1212
00:55:14,833 --> 00:55:16,617
And we are finding out

1213
00:55:18,271 --> 00:55:21,709
who is the enemy of America.

1214
00:55:22,841 --> 00:55:26,235
People that are creating the
oppression in this country,

1215
00:55:26,366 --> 00:55:29,456
the people that are involved
with tearing down our freedoms,

1216
00:55:29,587 --> 00:55:32,764
our liberties and the value

1217
00:55:32,894 --> 00:55:35,027
of what we hold dear in this
country

1218
00:55:35,157 --> 00:55:37,812
need to be placed on lists.

1219
00:55:37,943 --> 00:55:41,120
People like Dr. Fauci that have
constantly

1220
00:55:41,250 --> 00:55:42,643
in his life caused death,

1221
00:55:42,774 --> 00:55:46,255
destruction, illness, and
horrible things.

1222
00:55:46,386 --> 00:55:48,127
They have to be put on these
lists.

1223
00:55:48,257 --> 00:55:51,173
They have to be put out of
our society all together

1224
00:55:51,304 --> 00:55:52,653
and never be trusted again.

1225
00:55:52,784 --> 00:55:55,482
Now, if someone ends up

1226
00:55:56,527 --> 00:55:57,963
attacking these people

1227
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:01,314
that have been found to be
an enemy of the United States

1228
00:56:01,445 --> 00:56:05,318
and they're criminals, I'm not
gonna shed a tear about it.

1229
00:56:08,713 --> 00:56:09,540
Come here.

1230
00:56:10,410 --> 00:56:11,280
Good boy.

1231
00:56:14,893 --> 00:56:17,243
When I left the military,
I was a hardcore Republican.

1232
00:56:17,374 --> 00:56:20,681
I was libertarian like a lot
of people in the military.

1233
00:56:21,290 --> 00:56:23,815
I was looking at like, I can't
even call 'em documentaries.

1234
00:56:23,945 --> 00:56:28,341
But these YouTube videos
like this movie, "Zeitgeist."

1235
00:56:30,691 --> 00:56:32,911
You had better wake up and
understand

1236
00:56:33,041 --> 00:56:35,435
that there are people
who are guiding your life

1237
00:56:35,566 --> 00:56:36,784
and you don't even know it.

1238
00:56:36,915 --> 00:56:38,743
Now that I study extremism,

1239
00:56:38,873 --> 00:56:43,704
I recognize it's filled
with anti-Semitic tropes.

1240
00:56:43,835 --> 00:56:46,228
The theme of the movie
without explicitly saying it,

1241
00:56:46,359 --> 00:56:49,144
is that Jewish people are out
there controlling the banks

1242
00:56:49,275 --> 00:56:51,103
and the banks are the
reasons why we go into wars.

1243
00:56:51,233 --> 00:56:54,062
So therefore the Jews
are responsible for
my friends dying.

1244
00:56:54,193 --> 00:56:55,847
That's the connection
that it's trying to make.

1245
00:56:55,977 --> 00:56:57,457
[Rockefeller] The ultimate
goal is to get everybody

1246
00:56:57,588 --> 00:57:00,591
in this world chipped with an
RFID chip.

1247
00:57:00,721 --> 00:57:02,767
And have all money
be on those chips

1248
00:57:02,897 --> 00:57:04,464
and everything
on those chips.

1249
00:57:04,595 --> 00:57:06,771
And if anybody wants
to protest what we do,

1250
00:57:06,901 --> 00:57:10,122
or violate what we want,
we just turn off their chip.

1251
00:57:10,252 --> 00:57:14,605
I just absorbed this
propaganda and fell for it,

1252
00:57:14,735 --> 00:57:15,649
fell into it.

1253
00:57:16,128 --> 00:57:17,390
And I was watching Alex Jones

1254
00:57:17,521 --> 00:57:18,957
before anyone knew what his
name was.

1255
00:57:19,087 --> 00:57:20,654
I mean now they're openly
bragging

1256
00:57:20,785 --> 00:57:22,743
it's world government and they
run it.

1257
00:57:22,874 --> 00:57:25,311
[Kristofer]
Tucker Carlson when
he was back on MSNBC

1258
00:57:25,442 --> 00:57:26,181
and Glenn Beck.

1259
00:57:26,312 --> 00:57:27,444
It's all connected.

1260
00:57:27,574 --> 00:57:30,229
These people down
here are radicals.

1261
00:57:30,359 --> 00:57:32,492
And all of these concepts
started to fit together

1262
00:57:32,623 --> 00:57:34,146
and feed this narrative,

1263
00:57:34,276 --> 00:57:36,844
this idea that I had felt

1264
00:57:36,975 --> 00:57:38,977
but couldn't put
words to for so long,

1265
00:57:39,107 --> 00:57:41,980
that I was the victim,
not just of circumstance,

1266
00:57:42,110 --> 00:57:47,855
but of some sort of nefarious
group of powerful individuals

1267
00:57:47,986 --> 00:57:51,163
who were manipulating all
of us and that everyone

1268
00:57:51,293 --> 00:57:53,426
was just acting as puppets.

1269
00:57:53,557 --> 00:57:56,168
You know what people
now call the deep state,

1270
00:57:56,298 --> 00:57:57,604
but we were awake.

1271
00:58:00,825 --> 00:58:03,088
And it was our job to
wake everybody else up.

1272
00:58:05,133 --> 00:58:06,308
Who's a patriot?

1273
00:58:07,527 --> 00:58:08,963
Video.

1274
00:58:10,487 --> 00:58:13,011
[rock music]

1275
00:58:30,550 --> 00:58:31,682
[Speaker] Ladies and
gentlemen,

1276
00:58:31,812 --> 00:58:36,164
prepare for the storm
[indistinct].

1277
00:58:37,644 --> 00:58:39,254
Yep that's.

1278
00:58:39,385 --> 00:58:41,779
[Speaker] Come on, come on.

1279
00:58:42,910 --> 00:58:44,521
There was a lot there.

1280
00:58:44,651 --> 00:58:48,394
They flashed photos of the
pyramid on our dollar bills.

1281
00:58:48,525 --> 00:58:51,397
They showed a picture of George
Soros.

1282
00:58:51,528 --> 00:58:53,921
They talked about the World
Bank.

1283
00:58:54,052 --> 00:58:55,357
Everything's incorporated.

1284
00:58:55,488 --> 00:58:58,273
These are all things
that I didn't understand

1285
00:58:58,404 --> 00:59:04,453
when I was watching
my propaganda videos
back in 2007, 2008.

1286
00:59:04,584 --> 00:59:05,977
But man, I mean,

1287
00:59:06,107 --> 00:59:07,805
it's like they just took
notes off of the shit

1288
00:59:07,935 --> 00:59:10,634
that had me all confused
and crazy back then.

1289
00:59:10,764 --> 00:59:13,114
And the second
thing was my family.

1290
00:59:14,202 --> 00:59:16,378
These groups have always
operated on a playbook

1291
00:59:16,509 --> 00:59:20,644
of using the prevailing social
context to mobilize people,

1292
00:59:20,774 --> 00:59:22,559
recruit and radicalize.

1293
00:59:26,998 --> 00:59:30,436
The 20s Klan was
anti-Black and anti-Jewish,

1294
00:59:30,567 --> 00:59:32,873
but it was also anti-Mexican
near the border,

1295
00:59:33,004 --> 00:59:35,093
anti-labor in the Pacific
northwest,

1296
00:59:35,223 --> 00:59:36,616
anti-immigrant in the northeast

1297
00:59:36,747 --> 00:59:37,835
where there were a lot of
immigrants.

1298
00:59:37,965 --> 00:59:39,358
What it did was figure out

1299
00:59:39,488 --> 00:59:41,229
what the prevailing social
tensions were

1300
00:59:41,360 --> 00:59:42,840
in a given community,

1301
00:59:42,970 --> 00:59:46,626
and use those to recruit
people for its own purposes.

1302
00:59:46,757 --> 00:59:48,628
[explosion]

1303
00:59:48,759 --> 00:59:50,064
[Narrator]
The prevailing feeling

1304
00:59:50,195 --> 00:59:52,676
among a host of veterans
returning from Vietnam,

1305
00:59:52,806 --> 00:59:55,243
was that they had been
stabbed in the back

1306
00:59:55,374 --> 00:59:57,463
by an ungrateful society,

1307
00:59:57,594 --> 00:59:59,334
their own feckless government,

1308
01:00:00,858 --> 01:00:02,207
and the media elite.

1309
01:00:02,337 --> 01:00:04,513
Well it seems now
more certain than ever,

1310
01:00:04,644 --> 01:00:06,690
that the bloody experience of
Vietnam

1311
01:00:06,820 --> 01:00:08,605
is to end in a stalemate.

1312
01:00:08,735 --> 01:00:10,215
[Narrator] It made them ripe
recruits

1313
01:00:10,345 --> 01:00:14,523
for a new, conspiracy-fueled
wave of violent extremism

1314
01:00:14,654 --> 01:00:17,352
aimed at rooting
out the enemy within.

1315
01:00:17,483 --> 01:00:19,833
The Cubans are coming
in by the thousands.

1316
01:00:19,964 --> 01:00:22,401
The Mexicans are coming
in by the millions.

1317
01:00:22,531 --> 01:00:25,273
The the Haitians are
coming in from Haiti

1318
01:00:25,404 --> 01:00:28,102
or wherever that little
nigger country is,

1319
01:00:28,233 --> 01:00:30,235
coming in by the hundreds of
thousands.

1320
01:00:30,365 --> 01:00:31,497
White people have had enough.

1321
01:00:31,628 --> 01:00:33,107
They can no longer
even afford to buy

1322
01:00:33,238 --> 01:00:35,806
proper housing for themselves,

1323
01:00:35,936 --> 01:00:37,503
yet our government would have
us spend

1324
01:00:37,634 --> 01:00:40,245
thousands and thousands
of millions of dollars

1325
01:00:40,375 --> 01:00:41,594
on non-whites.

1326
01:00:41,725 --> 01:00:43,161
They've had enough.

1327
01:00:43,291 --> 01:00:44,597
One of the key figures
in the white power movement

1328
01:00:44,728 --> 01:00:45,816
after the Vietnam War,

1329
01:00:45,946 --> 01:00:47,948
and one of the architects of
its move

1330
01:00:48,079 --> 01:00:49,428
to cell style terrorism,

1331
01:00:49,558 --> 01:00:50,864
to using the early internet

1332
01:00:50,995 --> 01:00:52,997
and to a number of
other major changes

1333
01:00:53,127 --> 01:00:56,609
that fueled its rise is a
veteran named, Louis Beam.

1334
01:00:56,740 --> 01:00:59,220
The only thing that's
important tonight,

1335
01:00:59,351 --> 01:01:03,268
is will America be white
100 years from tonight?

1336
01:01:03,398 --> 01:01:04,965
And if so,

1337
01:01:05,096 --> 01:01:08,403
will you commit yourself to
the battle to make it so?

1338
01:01:08,534 --> 01:01:10,884
[Narrator] Louis Beam
served two tours in Vietnam

1339
01:01:11,015 --> 01:01:12,233
as a helicopter gunner,

1340
01:01:12,364 --> 01:01:15,367
and came home in 1968 with
multiple medals

1341
01:01:15,497 --> 01:01:17,238
for bravery in combat.

1342
01:01:17,369 --> 01:01:19,937
Says that I used great
professional skill and courage

1343
01:01:20,067 --> 01:01:22,766
in the face of great personal
danger.

1344
01:01:22,896 --> 01:01:25,507
That hasn't changed at all in
my opinion.

1345
01:01:25,638 --> 01:01:28,685
Presently, I'm having to use
utmost skill,

1346
01:01:28,815 --> 01:01:31,339
and I think it does take courage

1347
01:01:31,470 --> 01:01:33,777
to do what I'm doing,

1348
01:01:33,907 --> 01:01:35,561
and I'm doing it in the face of
the enemy.

1349
01:01:35,692 --> 01:01:40,261
This time the enemy goes
under a different name.

1350
01:01:40,392 --> 01:01:43,003
[Narrator] Beam took the
skills he honed in the military

1351
01:01:43,134 --> 01:01:45,223
and brought them to the KKK,

1352
01:01:45,353 --> 01:01:48,487
where he rose to Grand
Dragon of the Texas Knights.

1353
01:01:48,617 --> 01:01:50,489
I have been paid by the
government

1354
01:01:50,619 --> 01:01:53,840
$300 a month to fight and kill
commies,

1355
01:01:53,971 --> 01:01:59,280
or execute 'em, whatever term
you want to use, in Vietnam.

1356
01:01:59,411 --> 01:02:01,718
And what is the difference
between Vietnam

1357
01:02:01,848 --> 01:02:04,938
and Houston, Texas, but
a few thousand miles?

1358
01:02:09,464 --> 01:02:10,814
One of the reasons that Beam

1359
01:02:10,944 --> 01:02:13,773
rose so quickly in these
organizations,

1360
01:02:13,904 --> 01:02:16,254
is that he told a story
about warfare and trauma

1361
01:02:16,384 --> 01:02:19,039
that a lot of other
people were mobilized by,

1362
01:02:19,170 --> 01:02:21,041
including people
who didn't serve.

1363
01:02:21,172 --> 01:02:25,393
I saw a young man
about 19 years old,

1364
01:02:26,394 --> 01:02:29,746
entrapped in a armored
personnel carrier

1365
01:02:31,225 --> 01:02:34,098
about 22 miles
northeast of Saigon,

1366
01:02:35,229 --> 01:02:37,057
with his legs pinned beneath
the seat

1367
01:02:37,188 --> 01:02:40,887
as a result of a rocket
propelled grenade.

1368
01:02:41,018 --> 01:02:44,108
And he stayed on the radio,

1369
01:02:45,109 --> 01:02:46,414
kept asking for help,

1370
01:02:48,852 --> 01:02:50,636
asking us to

1371
01:02:51,419 --> 01:02:52,551
come get him.

1372
01:02:56,250 --> 01:02:59,471
So his argument was
about the wrongness of war,

1373
01:02:59,601 --> 01:03:01,821
the horror of seeing
casualties in the field,

1374
01:03:01,952 --> 01:03:04,302
the horror of losing your
fellow soldiers.

1375
01:03:04,432 --> 01:03:06,217
But his pivot was,

1376
01:03:06,347 --> 01:03:09,437
this is why we should come
back to the United States

1377
01:03:09,568 --> 01:03:13,354
and bring that violence home
to everybody who left us there.

1378
01:03:13,485 --> 01:03:16,357
Our mission is a
reconnaissance patrol.

1379
01:03:16,488 --> 01:03:19,883
We have information that the
enemy

1380
01:03:20,753 --> 01:03:22,407
is in the area.

1381
01:03:23,408 --> 01:03:24,278
Halt.

1382
01:03:26,193 --> 01:03:29,240
The Jews have assumed leadership
of the federal government.

1383
01:03:29,370 --> 01:03:32,330
They totally control it, and
they're controlling us thusly.

1384
01:03:32,460 --> 01:03:34,549
The government that's
in Washington DC today

1385
01:03:34,680 --> 01:03:36,987
does not represent the
interest of the white people.

1386
01:03:37,117 --> 01:03:39,467
Therefore, we will
replace them with people

1387
01:03:39,598 --> 01:03:41,208
who will represent the ideals

1388
01:03:41,339 --> 01:03:44,385
of white western Christian
civilization.

1389
01:03:45,517 --> 01:03:48,868
How are we gonna replace
them? By any means necessary.

1390
01:03:48,999 --> 01:03:52,263
We want the heads of the
enemies in our to toe sacks.

1391
01:03:52,393 --> 01:03:53,568
In Vietnam, they took ears.

1392
01:03:53,699 --> 01:03:55,092
We're gonna take heads.

1393
01:03:56,441 --> 01:03:58,878
[Narrator] Beam's rhetoric
and military exercises

1394
01:03:59,009 --> 01:04:01,968
eventually got the attention of
the FBI.

1395
01:04:02,099 --> 01:04:06,320
And in 1983, he left Texas
for Hayden Lake, Idaho,

1396
01:04:06,451 --> 01:04:09,410
a haven for white supremacists.

1397
01:04:09,541 --> 01:04:11,630
He joined forces with Aryan
nations

1398
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:15,329
and began to command a cell
style terrorist movement

1399
01:04:15,460 --> 01:04:16,940
of white power activists.

1400
01:04:17,070 --> 01:04:19,856
The idea was that one or a
few white power activists

1401
01:04:19,986 --> 01:04:22,293
could work together
towards a commonly held

1402
01:04:22,423 --> 01:04:24,121
set of goals and targets,

1403
01:04:24,251 --> 01:04:26,471
but without prosecutable
ties between them,

1404
01:04:26,601 --> 01:04:29,169
and without direct ties
to movement leadership.

1405
01:04:30,344 --> 01:04:32,042
[Narrator] But there was a
problem.

1406
01:04:32,172 --> 01:04:34,305
The cells, which were
spread across the country

1407
01:04:34,435 --> 01:04:35,741
and into Canada,

1408
01:04:35,872 --> 01:04:38,309
still needed to communicate
with each other.

1409
01:04:38,439 --> 01:04:42,008
And even when the FBI wasn't
listening on their phones,

1410
01:04:42,139 --> 01:04:44,619
Beam wanted to
do more than talk.

1411
01:04:44,750 --> 01:04:48,362
He wanted to share ideas
and create networks.

1412
01:04:48,493 --> 01:04:50,060
[phone dialing]

1413
01:04:50,190 --> 01:04:53,280
So they created a social
network called Liberty Net.

1414
01:04:53,411 --> 01:04:55,413
And one of the first postings
was titled,

1415
01:04:55,543 --> 01:04:58,068
"On-Line for God and Country."

1416
01:05:01,375 --> 01:05:04,596
And then Louis Beam
traveled around the country,

1417
01:05:04,726 --> 01:05:07,251
teaching people
how to go online.

1418
01:05:07,381 --> 01:05:10,428
These message boards
included assassination lists,

1419
01:05:10,558 --> 01:05:14,040
and ideological content and
who you should hate and why.

1420
01:05:14,171 --> 01:05:17,000
But they also included
social network content

1421
01:05:17,130 --> 01:05:18,523
like personal ads.

1422
01:05:19,916 --> 01:05:22,309
And this was in 1984-85,

1423
01:05:22,440 --> 01:05:24,355
way before most
people think about

1424
01:05:24,485 --> 01:05:26,226
far right online activism.

1425
01:05:26,357 --> 01:05:27,749
Decades before Facebook.

1426
01:05:30,491 --> 01:05:32,972
[Narrator] Using this
early form of the internet,

1427
01:05:33,103 --> 01:05:37,759
Klansman, skinheads, Neo Nazis,
and other extremist groups

1428
01:05:37,890 --> 01:05:41,067
banded together to commit a
series of heinous robberies,

1429
01:05:41,198 --> 01:05:43,940
bombings, and murders
across the country.

1430
01:05:44,070 --> 01:05:45,332
And since we're all racist,

1431
01:05:45,463 --> 01:05:47,247
since we're all
the radical right,

1432
01:05:47,378 --> 01:05:49,293
and that's a crime in America.

1433
01:05:49,423 --> 01:05:53,036
When you have to do the
time, don't regret the crime.

1434
01:05:53,166 --> 01:05:54,994
We'll be at the forefront of
the fight.

1435
01:05:55,125 --> 01:05:56,474
[Interviewer] Doing what?

1436
01:05:56,604 --> 01:06:00,260
Hopefully smashing
the skulls of communists

1437
01:06:00,391 --> 01:06:02,436
or executing race traitors

1438
01:06:02,567 --> 01:06:05,831
or shooting on sight anybody
we don't think is white.

1439
01:06:05,962 --> 01:06:07,441
We have to get our government
back.

1440
01:06:07,572 --> 01:06:08,747
That's what it's all about.

1441
01:06:08,877 --> 01:06:10,879
All these so-called
subversive groups

1442
01:06:11,010 --> 01:06:14,666
are nothing but patriotic
citizens trying to do just that.

1443
01:06:14,796 --> 01:06:17,277
[Narrator] By 1985,
the Department of Justice

1444
01:06:17,408 --> 01:06:20,541
came to believe that the
network of white power cells

1445
01:06:20,672 --> 01:06:22,108
behind these crimes

1446
01:06:22,239 --> 01:06:25,894
represented a serious
threat to national security.

1447
01:06:26,025 --> 01:06:29,724
Louis Beam has been charged
with Seditious Conspiracy,

1448
01:06:29,855 --> 01:06:32,466
along with 13 other individuals.

1449
01:06:36,035 --> 01:06:38,820
What else is a country boy
gonna do on Saturday night

1450
01:06:38,951 --> 01:06:41,301
when the only drugstore in
town's closed?

1451
01:06:42,389 --> 01:06:43,477
[Narrator] But the trial

1452
01:06:43,608 --> 01:06:45,262
was a disaster for the
government.

1453
01:06:45,392 --> 01:06:47,003
A stunning verdict this
afternoon,

1454
01:06:47,133 --> 01:06:49,657
the trial of 13 white
supremacists.

1455
01:06:49,788 --> 01:06:51,398
Among charges they faced,

1456
01:06:51,529 --> 01:06:54,314
conspiracy to overthrow the
government of the United States.

1457
01:06:54,445 --> 01:06:55,968
The verdicts from the all
white jury

1458
01:06:56,099 --> 01:06:58,536
came on the fourth day of
deliberations.

1459
01:06:58,666 --> 01:07:02,235
Beam and his co-defendants
were acquitted on all charges.

1460
01:07:02,366 --> 01:07:04,716
The humiliating
outcome led the DOJ

1461
01:07:04,846 --> 01:07:08,241
to focus their attention
on individual criminals

1462
01:07:08,372 --> 01:07:11,636
and abandon investigations
of the white power movement

1463
01:07:11,766 --> 01:07:14,073
as a domestic terrorist threat.

1464
01:07:14,204 --> 01:07:17,033
The catastrophic legacy
of leaderless resistance

1465
01:07:17,163 --> 01:07:19,426
has been that we as a public

1466
01:07:19,557 --> 01:07:21,124
have lost sight of this
movement.

1467
01:07:21,254 --> 01:07:24,083
We don't have any domestic
terrorism legislation.

1468
01:07:24,214 --> 01:07:25,911
We don't have domestic
terrorism laws.

1469
01:07:26,042 --> 01:07:28,827
For example, the number one tool

1470
01:07:28,957 --> 01:07:31,482
FBI agents and prosecutors use

1471
01:07:31,612 --> 01:07:34,354
to disrupt terrorist
attacks in the United States

1472
01:07:34,485 --> 01:07:35,834
is material support.

1473
01:07:39,446 --> 01:07:42,754
Material support is
basically a charge to levy

1474
01:07:42,884 --> 01:07:46,018
on individuals who are helping
a terrorist organization

1475
01:07:46,149 --> 01:07:47,889
or a violent organization.

1476
01:07:48,020 --> 01:07:49,543
Unfortunately,
we don't have that

1477
01:07:49,674 --> 01:07:52,155
when it comes to domestic
terrorist organizations.

1478
01:07:54,461 --> 01:07:56,550
The problem with this situation
is,

1479
01:07:56,681 --> 01:07:59,423
when you don't have
domestic terrorism laws,

1480
01:07:59,553 --> 01:08:01,077
you need an act to happen.

1481
01:08:01,207 --> 01:08:04,993
You need a hot body in order
to start an investigation,

1482
01:08:05,124 --> 01:08:07,518
and usually you can
charge that individual

1483
01:08:07,648 --> 01:08:09,955
with hate crime or
with other charges,

1484
01:08:10,086 --> 01:08:11,696
but you cannot charge
them with terrorism.

1485
01:08:11,826 --> 01:08:14,786
You cannot go after
the whole network.

1486
01:08:14,916 --> 01:08:17,615
[News Reporter] Holy cow,
about a third of the building

1487
01:08:17,745 --> 01:08:20,835
has been blown away,
it's just devastating.

1488
01:08:21,793 --> 01:08:24,578
[crowd shouting]

1489
01:08:25,405 --> 01:08:26,928
A massive car bomb exploded

1490
01:08:27,059 --> 01:08:28,452
outside of a large federal
building

1491
01:08:28,582 --> 01:08:30,280
in downtown Oklahoma City,

1492
01:08:30,410 --> 01:08:32,891
shattering that building,
killing children,

1493
01:08:33,021 --> 01:08:36,721
killing federal employees,
military men and civilians.

1494
01:08:36,851 --> 01:08:38,679
Even Timothy McVeigh,

1495
01:08:38,810 --> 01:08:41,508
he blew up a
whole federal building,

1496
01:08:41,639 --> 01:08:43,989
and prosecutors could not charge

1497
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:47,906
him or his associates with
terrorism.

1498
01:08:50,082 --> 01:08:52,650
The bombing of Oklahoma City
in 1995

1499
01:08:52,780 --> 01:08:55,305
was the largest deliberate
mass casualty event

1500
01:08:55,435 --> 01:08:58,699
on American soil between
Pearl Harbor and 9-11,

1501
01:08:58,830 --> 01:09:01,137
but most people
still don't understand

1502
01:09:01,267 --> 01:09:03,443
what that event was
and what it meant.

1503
01:09:03,574 --> 01:09:04,749
[News Reporter] The
indictment charges

1504
01:09:04,879 --> 01:09:06,620
that Timothy McVeigh
and Terry Nichols,

1505
01:09:06,751 --> 01:09:09,319
former army buddies with a
grudge against the government,

1506
01:09:09,449 --> 01:09:11,147
planned the bombing,
selected the [indistinct].

1507
01:09:11,277 --> 01:09:13,888
McVeigh and Nichols met each
other through their service.

1508
01:09:14,019 --> 01:09:16,456
They trained together
at Fort Riley, Kansas,

1509
01:09:16,587 --> 01:09:18,850
before McVeigh
deployed to the Gulf

1510
01:09:18,980 --> 01:09:21,766
as part of Big Red One
Infantry Unit in Iraq.

1511
01:09:21,896 --> 01:09:24,464
There he seems to have
experienced some amount

1512
01:09:24,595 --> 01:09:27,511
of traumatic combat
before their return home.

1513
01:09:29,339 --> 01:09:32,820
After washing out of Special
Forces, he was really angry,

1514
01:09:32,951 --> 01:09:36,476
and we see at that moment
his deepening involvement

1515
01:09:36,607 --> 01:09:39,044
in radical white power activity.

1516
01:09:39,175 --> 01:09:41,307
[guns firing]

1517
01:09:41,438 --> 01:09:45,355
Ranging from McVeigh's
connection
to the Michigan militia.

1518
01:09:45,485 --> 01:09:46,965
The federal government itself

1519
01:09:47,095 --> 01:09:49,054
is the child of the armed
citizen.

1520
01:09:49,185 --> 01:09:50,621
We, the people are the parent

1521
01:09:50,751 --> 01:09:52,318
of the child we call government.

1522
01:09:52,449 --> 01:09:54,581
In short, the federal
government needs a good spanking

1523
01:09:54,712 --> 01:09:56,104
to make it behave.

1524
01:09:56,235 --> 01:09:58,063
His contact and attempted
contact with groups

1525
01:09:58,194 --> 01:10:00,718
like the Arizona Patriots
and the National Alliance,

1526
01:10:00,848 --> 01:10:04,156
and his written belief
in white power principles

1527
01:10:04,287 --> 01:10:07,115
that were published in
his hometown newspaper.

1528
01:10:07,246 --> 01:10:09,509
[Narrator] McVeigh used
his military training

1529
01:10:09,640 --> 01:10:12,338
to help carry out the
Oklahoma City bombing.

1530
01:10:12,469 --> 01:10:14,079
And in a letter to a friend,

1531
01:10:14,210 --> 01:10:17,604
he invoked his military
oath to justify it.

1532
01:10:17,735 --> 01:10:21,042
I have sworn to uphold and
defend the constitution

1533
01:10:21,173 --> 01:10:25,308
against all enemies, foreign
and domestic, and I will.

1534
01:10:25,438 --> 01:10:27,179
Blood will flow in the streets.

1535
01:10:27,310 --> 01:10:28,789
Good versus evil.

1536
01:10:28,920 --> 01:10:32,402
Free men versus socialist
wannabe slaves.

1537
01:10:32,532 --> 01:10:34,882
Pray it's not your blood,
my friend.

1538
01:10:35,013 --> 01:10:36,580
The other key component here

1539
01:10:36,710 --> 01:10:39,322
was his use of
"The Turner Diaries".

1540
01:10:39,452 --> 01:10:41,062
[Narrator] At gun shows,
Timothy McVeigh

1541
01:10:41,193 --> 01:10:43,674
would hand out copies
of "The Turner Diaries",

1542
01:10:43,804 --> 01:10:45,763
a dystopian novel that details

1543
01:10:45,893 --> 01:10:47,591
how to topple the US government.

1544
01:10:47,721 --> 01:10:49,636
The fictional
revolutionaries start

1545
01:10:49,767 --> 01:10:51,682
by blowing up a federal
building,

1546
01:10:51,812 --> 01:10:54,946
and then proceed to exterminate
their political enemies,

1547
01:10:55,076 --> 01:10:58,689
including all
Jews, Blacks, and Latinos.

1548
01:10:58,819 --> 01:11:01,126
"The Turner Diaries"
became enormously important

1549
01:11:01,257 --> 01:11:03,650
to this movement, not
because it's a good book,

1550
01:11:03,781 --> 01:11:06,087
but because it provides
the imaginative answer

1551
01:11:06,218 --> 01:11:07,872
to a really important question,

1552
01:11:08,002 --> 01:11:11,310
which is how can a tiny group
of people,

1553
01:11:11,441 --> 01:11:13,138
a small fringe movement,

1554
01:11:13,269 --> 01:11:15,053
do what they're setting
out to do in this period,

1555
01:11:15,183 --> 01:11:17,925
which is to overthrow the
most militarized superstate

1556
01:11:18,056 --> 01:11:19,623
in world history.

1557
01:11:19,753 --> 01:11:22,190
[Narrator] In 1997,
McVeigh was convicted

1558
01:11:22,321 --> 01:11:25,150
of murdering 168 people,

1559
01:11:25,281 --> 01:11:27,587
using a weapon of mass
destruction,

1560
01:11:27,718 --> 01:11:29,850
and blowing up a federal
building.

1561
01:11:29,981 --> 01:11:33,027
No domestic terrorism charges
were brought, however,

1562
01:11:33,158 --> 01:11:36,596
because he and Nichols were
thought to have acted alone.

1563
01:11:36,727 --> 01:11:40,774
Just imagine if Timothy
McVeigh's name was Mohamed.

1564
01:11:40,905 --> 01:11:42,472
We will look at
that terrorism threat

1565
01:11:42,602 --> 01:11:45,039
in a very different lens.

1566
01:11:45,170 --> 01:11:46,389
First of all,

1567
01:11:46,519 --> 01:11:48,565
we will look at it as a
terrorist threat.

1568
01:11:48,695 --> 01:11:50,218
We will go after McVeigh.

1569
01:11:50,349 --> 01:11:52,569
We will go after all the
people who are helping him

1570
01:11:52,699 --> 01:11:54,484
and who are assisting him.

1571
01:11:54,614 --> 01:11:57,225
We will keep
the investigation going

1572
01:11:57,356 --> 01:11:59,750
in order to get
the whole network.

1573
01:11:59,880 --> 01:12:04,058
When you are very limited
with the tools you are using,

1574
01:12:04,189 --> 01:12:06,104
these groups will
take benefits from it.

1575
01:12:06,234 --> 01:12:07,497
These are not lone wolves.

1576
01:12:07,627 --> 01:12:09,325
These are people who
are united by ideology,

1577
01:12:09,455 --> 01:12:12,676
by social ties,
by selection of targets.

1578
01:12:12,806 --> 01:12:14,373
These are all part
of the same movement,

1579
01:12:14,504 --> 01:12:15,940
and this is really
what we're seeing

1580
01:12:16,070 --> 01:12:18,029
continuing into
our present day moment.

1581
01:12:19,465 --> 01:12:22,338
[dark music]

1582
01:12:22,468 --> 01:12:26,167
Tonight, the plot to kidnap
a governor foiled by the FBI.

1583
01:12:29,040 --> 01:12:30,694
[Narrator] In October, 2020,

1584
01:12:30,824 --> 01:12:33,436
less than a month before
the presidential election,

1585
01:12:33,566 --> 01:12:36,482
14 men were arrested in a plot
to kidnap

1586
01:12:36,613 --> 01:12:38,963
Michigan Governor Gretchen
Whitmer,

1587
01:12:39,093 --> 01:12:42,140
their plans included
storming the state capitol,

1588
01:12:42,270 --> 01:12:44,621
using zip ties to take hostages,

1589
01:12:44,751 --> 01:12:46,797
and conducting a trial
that would result

1590
01:12:46,927 --> 01:12:49,234
in a public hanging
of the governor.

1591
01:12:49,365 --> 01:12:52,585
The suspects were all members
of the Wolverine Watchmen,

1592
01:12:52,716 --> 01:12:55,980
a paramilitary group
commanded by a former Marine

1593
01:12:56,110 --> 01:12:58,635
that had ties to the Michigan
militia.

1594
01:12:58,765 --> 01:13:01,855
Prosecutors contend that
they wanted to kidnap her

1595
01:13:01,986 --> 01:13:04,597
to try to ignite another
American Civil War

1596
01:13:04,728 --> 01:13:06,120
before the 2020 election,

1597
01:13:06,251 --> 01:13:07,731
in hopes of disrupting it

1598
01:13:07,861 --> 01:13:09,820
and perhaps keeping Joe Biden
from becoming president.

1599
01:13:09,950 --> 01:13:12,213
[Narrator] But federal
prosecutors could not charge

1600
01:13:12,344 --> 01:13:15,042
any of the conspirators
with material support.

1601
01:13:15,173 --> 01:13:17,088
And despite having a mountain
of evidence

1602
01:13:17,218 --> 01:13:18,959
laid out against them at trial.

1603
01:13:19,090 --> 01:13:20,221
[News Reporter] The
group's leader, Adam Fox,

1604
01:13:20,352 --> 01:13:22,006
telling the informant he was
inspired

1605
01:13:22,136 --> 01:13:25,096
by Oklahoma City bombing
terrorist, Timothy McVeigh,

1606
01:13:25,226 --> 01:13:27,881
telling the informant, if
we can't have our world,

1607
01:13:28,012 --> 01:13:29,405
they can't have theirs.

1608
01:13:29,535 --> 01:13:30,754
Burning it down.

1609
01:13:30,884 --> 01:13:32,320
[Narrator] Like Louis Beam
before them.

1610
01:13:32,451 --> 01:13:34,671
If we can't have this
country, nobody gets it.

1611
01:13:34,801 --> 01:13:36,020
Is that clear?

1612
01:13:36,150 --> 01:13:37,543
There's gonna be total ashes
everywhere.

1613
01:13:37,674 --> 01:13:38,849
[Narrator] None of the
defendants

1614
01:13:38,979 --> 01:13:41,547
were convicted
on federal charges.

1615
01:13:41,678 --> 01:13:44,202
The goals of this insurgency
in Michigan

1616
01:13:44,332 --> 01:13:46,422
were to take over
the State House,

1617
01:13:46,552 --> 01:13:48,946
and then to kidnap and
execute the governor.

1618
01:13:49,076 --> 01:13:50,817
The goal of the insurgency
on January 6th

1619
01:13:50,948 --> 01:13:53,559
was to overturn the results
of a democratic election.

1620
01:13:53,690 --> 01:13:56,867
So if we see this
as part of a movement,

1621
01:13:56,997 --> 01:13:59,739
it's to stop the American people

1622
01:13:59,870 --> 01:14:01,175
being able to choose
their own leaders.

1623
01:14:01,306 --> 01:14:02,742
An insurgency is all about

1624
01:14:02,873 --> 01:14:04,614
seizing control of a government,

1625
01:14:04,744 --> 01:14:06,354
not through winning an election,

1626
01:14:06,485 --> 01:14:08,531
not through democratic
processes,
not through persuasion,

1627
01:14:08,661 --> 01:14:09,749
but through violence.

1628
01:14:10,794 --> 01:14:12,404
It's a form of war.

1629
01:14:12,535 --> 01:14:14,624
[Crowd] USA, USA, USA.

1630
01:14:16,364 --> 01:14:18,976
Fuckin coward traitor bitch!

1631
01:14:19,106 --> 01:14:21,152
If you look at January 6th,

1632
01:14:21,282 --> 01:14:24,024
what we're looking at
is really the collision

1633
01:14:24,155 --> 01:14:26,549
of three different streams of
activity.

1634
01:14:26,679 --> 01:14:28,768
One is the organized white
power movement

1635
01:14:28,899 --> 01:14:32,076
that is coming off of
decades, if not generations,

1636
01:14:32,206 --> 01:14:35,732
of organizing, armament,
training, and ideological
content.

1637
01:14:35,862 --> 01:14:38,082
They want to know what
the orange hats stand for.

1638
01:14:38,212 --> 01:14:39,605
Fucking Proud Boys.

1639
01:14:39,736 --> 01:14:42,260
Another is QAnon, which
is newer, more radical,

1640
01:14:42,390 --> 01:14:43,348
works very fast.

1641
01:14:43,479 --> 01:14:45,002
Where we go one, we go all.

1642
01:14:45,132 --> 01:14:46,960
And the final one, the
biggest one,

1643
01:14:47,091 --> 01:14:48,614
is simply the Trump base.

1644
01:14:48,745 --> 01:14:52,966
[Crowd] We want Trump, we
want Trump, we want Trump.

1645
01:14:53,097 --> 01:14:54,533
We want Trump.

1646
01:14:54,664 --> 01:14:56,361
[Stanley] It's clear
to me that what you had

1647
01:14:56,492 --> 01:15:00,234
was a concerted effort by a
number of different organizers.

1648
01:15:00,365 --> 01:15:01,497
Do you want your house back?

1649
01:15:01,627 --> 01:15:02,541
[crowd] Yes.

1650
01:15:02,672 --> 01:15:04,238
Take it.

1651
01:15:04,369 --> 01:15:05,979
To take these various
groups together

1652
01:15:06,110 --> 01:15:10,723
and focus their energies
and to create a critical mass.

1653
01:15:10,854 --> 01:15:14,161
And that's not new.

1654
01:15:14,292 --> 01:15:16,729
[gun firing]

1655
01:15:19,515 --> 01:15:21,386
Allahu Akbar.

1656
01:15:21,517 --> 01:15:26,522
[speaking in foreign language]

1657
01:15:28,393 --> 01:15:32,484
In Iraq, when Al Qaeda in
Iraq emerged,

1658
01:15:32,615 --> 01:15:36,314
it really came led by a guy
named Abu Musab al-Zarqawi.

1659
01:15:36,444 --> 01:15:39,970
He traveled around the
country, had a charisma to him,

1660
01:15:40,100 --> 01:15:42,233
and he portrayed this,

1661
01:15:42,363 --> 01:15:45,236
hey, I'm not your normal
political leader,

1662
01:15:45,366 --> 01:15:48,935
and we are going to show
the kind of commitment

1663
01:15:49,066 --> 01:15:51,068
that real men would do.

1664
01:15:51,895 --> 01:15:55,942
And Al Qaeda in Iraq, which
was very extreme ideologically,

1665
01:15:56,073 --> 01:15:57,465
started to be joined by people

1666
01:15:57,596 --> 01:15:59,337
who weren't natural bedfellows.

1667
01:15:59,467 --> 01:16:00,773
People go, finally,

1668
01:16:00,904 --> 01:16:04,037
someone who's not gonna
put up with the crap,

1669
01:16:04,168 --> 01:16:07,650
someone who's going to take
the law into their own hands,

1670
01:16:07,780 --> 01:16:10,174
and is gonna get
us what we deserve,

1671
01:16:10,304 --> 01:16:16,876
because we have been exploited
by the elites of the region.

1672
01:16:17,007 --> 01:16:20,837
I think Abu Musab
al-Zarqawi and Donald Trump

1673
01:16:20,967 --> 01:16:25,058
both understand that you
can inflame those passions.

1674
01:16:25,189 --> 01:16:29,410
It is where the leader
takes those frustrations

1675
01:16:29,541 --> 01:16:33,023
that becomes potentially
disastrous.

1676
01:16:33,153 --> 01:16:35,112
Grievance narratives
are made up.

1677
01:16:35,242 --> 01:16:36,983
They're constructed narratives,

1678
01:16:37,114 --> 01:16:40,508
but they are used by
demagogues because they work.

1679
01:16:40,639 --> 01:16:41,858
And if you have a political
party

1680
01:16:41,988 --> 01:16:44,164
that is organized around
grievance,

1681
01:16:44,295 --> 01:16:46,950
around a sense of loss
and a sense of threat,

1682
01:16:47,080 --> 01:16:48,952
you have the basis for the
ideology

1683
01:16:49,082 --> 01:16:50,736
that will promote violence.

1684
01:16:50,867 --> 01:16:53,391
We're gathered together in the
heart of our nation's capital

1685
01:16:53,521 --> 01:16:57,656
for one very, very
basic and simple reason,

1686
01:16:57,787 --> 01:17:00,659
to save our democracy.

1687
01:17:00,790 --> 01:17:03,749
We're gonna walk down to the
capitol.

1688
01:17:03,880 --> 01:17:06,056
[crowd cheering]

1689
01:17:06,186 --> 01:17:10,016
And we're gonna cheer
on our brave senators

1690
01:17:10,147 --> 01:17:12,889
and congressmen and women.

1691
01:17:13,019 --> 01:17:15,326
And we're probably not
gonna be cheering so much

1692
01:17:15,456 --> 01:17:17,458
for some of them,

1693
01:17:19,199 --> 01:17:23,160
because you'll never take back
our country with weakness.

1694
01:17:23,290 --> 01:17:24,465
You have to show strength,

1695
01:17:24,596 --> 01:17:25,989
and you have to be strong.

1696
01:17:27,120 --> 01:17:29,601
[crowd shouting]

1697
01:17:29,732 --> 01:17:32,169
DC is a motherfucking war
zone.

1698
01:17:32,299 --> 01:17:33,649
Let's go.

1699
01:17:33,779 --> 01:17:36,477
This is what we came for, yeah.

1700
01:17:36,608 --> 01:17:38,784
[Narrator] The siege of
the capitol on January 6th

1701
01:17:38,915 --> 01:17:42,005
did not overturn the results
of the 2020 election,

1702
01:17:42,875 --> 01:17:44,572
but that's not the only measure

1703
01:17:44,703 --> 01:17:48,098
by which the actions of
that day are being judged.

1704
01:17:48,228 --> 01:17:50,448
There's footage of Proud
Boys directing journalists

1705
01:17:50,578 --> 01:17:52,102
to read "The Turner Diaries."

1706
01:17:53,277 --> 01:17:54,670
Read "The Turner Diaries."

1707
01:17:58,325 --> 01:17:59,631
On January 6th,

1708
01:17:59,762 --> 01:18:01,415
"The Turner Diaries"
was structuring

1709
01:18:01,546 --> 01:18:05,985
a lot of the imaginative,
performative action of that day.

1710
01:18:06,116 --> 01:18:07,683
The noose hung outside the
Capitol,

1711
01:18:07,813 --> 01:18:09,859
refers to events in "The Turner
Diaries"

1712
01:18:09,989 --> 01:18:11,164
called The Day of the Rope,

1713
01:18:11,295 --> 01:18:13,863
which is the hanging of race
traitors,

1714
01:18:13,993 --> 01:18:16,648
which include politicians.

1715
01:18:21,653 --> 01:18:23,220
And significantly,

1716
01:18:23,350 --> 01:18:26,092
there is a strike on the capitol
that is not supposed to be

1717
01:18:26,223 --> 01:18:27,528
a mass casualty attack.

1718
01:18:27,659 --> 01:18:29,443
In "The Turner Diaries",
it's a mortar attack.

1719
01:18:29,574 --> 01:18:32,185
It's meant to be simply
the selected killing

1720
01:18:32,316 --> 01:18:34,013
of a few corrupt legislators

1721
01:18:34,144 --> 01:18:36,624
in order to show other white
people

1722
01:18:36,755 --> 01:18:40,890
that extremists can strike at
the heart of American power.

1723
01:18:41,020 --> 01:18:44,154
[rioter yelling]

1724
01:18:44,284 --> 01:18:45,546
- We did it.
- We did it.

1725
01:18:45,677 --> 01:18:47,026
We fucking did it.

1726
01:18:47,157 --> 01:18:50,160
Yo, take laptops,
paperwork, take everything.

1727
01:18:50,290 --> 01:18:51,944
All that shit.

1728
01:18:55,600 --> 01:18:58,690
And by that measure,
I think that they succeeded.

1729
01:18:58,821 --> 01:19:01,214
Donald Trump tweeted out a
video.

1730
01:19:01,345 --> 01:19:04,217
He said, we did a good fucking
job.

1731
01:19:06,176 --> 01:19:08,482
January 6th was a huge
success for them.

1732
01:19:08,613 --> 01:19:12,182
January 6th inspired
so many people,

1733
01:19:12,312 --> 01:19:16,229
not only here in the United
States, but even in Europe,

1734
01:19:16,360 --> 01:19:19,145
that violence is the way
to change the government,

1735
01:19:19,276 --> 01:19:23,671
is a way to change the
establishments

1736
01:19:23,802 --> 01:19:27,719
in the western world that
they consider corrupt,

1737
01:19:27,850 --> 01:19:29,852
they consider evil.

1738
01:19:29,982 --> 01:19:32,593
They consider that these
governments are nothing

1739
01:19:32,724 --> 01:19:34,030
but tools to the Jews

1740
01:19:34,160 --> 01:19:36,684
or to whatever conspiracy they
believe in.

1741
01:19:41,994 --> 01:19:43,866
[Speaker] You believe the
rich people in the world

1742
01:19:43,996 --> 01:19:46,433
are using this disease and
exaggerating it

1743
01:19:46,564 --> 01:19:49,915
to create some sort of
apocalyptic nightmare, right?

1744
01:19:50,046 --> 01:19:51,612
You think it's common sense

1745
01:19:51,743 --> 01:19:54,746
that we all have to stay inside
and be afraid of the air?

1746
01:19:55,312 --> 01:19:56,443
[audience applauding]

1747
01:19:56,574 --> 01:19:59,272
[crowd hooting]

1748
01:20:01,622 --> 01:20:03,233
You look at January 6th,

1749
01:20:03,363 --> 01:20:05,801
I think the people that were
there that participated in it,

1750
01:20:05,931 --> 01:20:08,716
number one, they wanted it
to serve as a wake up call

1751
01:20:08,847 --> 01:20:10,718
to those people who are in
power.

1752
01:20:10,849 --> 01:20:13,547
And the fact of the matter is,

1753
01:20:13,678 --> 01:20:15,854
every single person
that was there that day

1754
01:20:15,985 --> 01:20:17,900
is a patriot of this nation.

1755
01:20:18,030 --> 01:20:19,162
[Speaker] Yo Randy, maybe you
wanna put

1756
01:20:19,292 --> 01:20:21,642
the beers inside the fridge.

1757
01:20:21,773 --> 01:20:24,036
Maybe you want to get off
your ass and do something.

1758
01:20:24,167 --> 01:20:26,909
Being a patriot, being a person
that loves their country,

1759
01:20:27,039 --> 01:20:29,389
especially, you know,
being a military veteran,

1760
01:20:29,520 --> 01:20:31,435
you take an oath to the
Constitution.

1761
01:20:31,565 --> 01:20:34,786
And for a lot of those people
that were there that day,

1762
01:20:34,917 --> 01:20:38,311
they felt that their
constitution
was being shredded up.

1763
01:20:38,442 --> 01:20:41,401
Our democracy was being shredded
right in front of our eyes.

1764
01:20:42,838 --> 01:20:44,056
I think it's absolutely
heartbreaking

1765
01:20:44,187 --> 01:20:45,666
to see veterans involved in
these things,

1766
01:20:45,797 --> 01:20:47,930
and I know for a lot of
them that their hearts

1767
01:20:48,060 --> 01:20:49,670
are in some ways in the right
place,

1768
01:20:49,801 --> 01:20:52,717
that we just don't live in the
same world of truth anymore.

1769
01:21:00,768 --> 01:21:02,509
The people in DC they
were Americans, yeah,

1770
01:21:02,640 --> 01:21:03,946
and they were patriots.

1771
01:21:04,076 --> 01:21:06,252
They only broke laws
because the DC police

1772
01:21:06,383 --> 01:21:07,819
didn't do their job.

1773
01:21:08,776 --> 01:21:10,474
[Interviewer] Okay, okay.

1774
01:21:10,604 --> 01:21:13,520
That's it, people died because
they didn't do their job.

1775
01:21:14,434 --> 01:21:15,958
So they broke into the capitol

1776
01:21:16,088 --> 01:21:17,829
because DC police
didn't do their job.

1777
01:21:17,960 --> 01:21:19,004
The DC police.

1778
01:21:19,135 --> 01:21:20,005
They didn't break into
anything.

1779
01:21:20,136 --> 01:21:21,615
They let 'em in.

1780
01:21:21,746 --> 01:21:23,443
Not only did they let them in,

1781
01:21:24,444 --> 01:21:25,793
it's paid for by tax dollars.

1782
01:21:25,924 --> 01:21:28,274
It's their fucking property.

1783
01:21:30,363 --> 01:21:32,017
Sorry.

1784
01:21:32,148 --> 01:21:36,108
This is the lethal danger of
the big election lie, right?

1785
01:21:36,239 --> 01:21:38,328
This is a conspiracy theory
that says,

1786
01:21:38,458 --> 01:21:40,286
the very heart of American
political life,

1787
01:21:40,417 --> 01:21:41,548
the very heart of our democracy,

1788
01:21:41,679 --> 01:21:43,420
has been destroyed
and taken from us,

1789
01:21:43,550 --> 01:21:45,161
which leaves us what recourse?

1790
01:21:45,291 --> 01:21:46,510
Do I believe the
election was stolen?

1791
01:21:46,640 --> 01:21:47,946
Absolutely, without a doubt.

1792
01:21:48,077 --> 01:21:50,862
There's no way in hell
Joe Biden was elected.

1793
01:21:50,993 --> 01:21:54,083
81 Million votes for Joe
Biden, I don't think so.

1794
01:21:54,213 --> 01:21:56,172
We're in a situation right now
where,

1795
01:21:57,086 --> 01:21:59,653
we can't trust our elections
anymore, we know that.

1796
01:21:59,784 --> 01:22:03,831
So what really is scary is, is
that what will the people do?

1797
01:22:03,962 --> 01:22:07,139
What will the average American
do when they finally wake up

1798
01:22:07,270 --> 01:22:09,054
to the reality of all this?

1799
01:22:09,185 --> 01:22:12,318
And the answer to that is, we
don't know.

1800
01:22:12,449 --> 01:22:15,147
We have no idea what the
American people will do.

1801
01:22:15,278 --> 01:22:18,542
This no longer is a
constitutional republic,

1802
01:22:18,672 --> 01:22:20,065
and we are going to fight

1803
01:22:20,196 --> 01:22:23,068
to bring our constitutional
republic back again.

1804
01:22:24,069 --> 01:22:27,203
We've had violent domestic
extremist organizations

1805
01:22:27,333 --> 01:22:28,944
for a long time,

1806
01:22:29,074 --> 01:22:30,815
but I think what makes this
moment particularly dangerous,

1807
01:22:30,946 --> 01:22:32,556
there are a couple of things.

1808
01:22:32,686 --> 01:22:35,559
The first one is the fact that
it's able to ride on a wave

1809
01:22:35,689 --> 01:22:37,865
of conspiracy thinking,

1810
01:22:37,996 --> 01:22:40,259
and general distrust

1811
01:22:40,390 --> 01:22:42,435
that's happening because of
social media technologies.

1812
01:22:42,566 --> 01:22:43,828
It's happening because of the
way

1813
01:22:43,959 --> 01:22:45,743
we've structured our
society on the internet,

1814
01:22:45,873 --> 01:22:48,528
that gives them the
sheer numbers of people

1815
01:22:48,659 --> 01:22:50,008
that they could never dream

1816
01:22:50,139 --> 01:22:51,749
of bringing to bear on their
own.

1817
01:22:51,879 --> 01:22:53,316
Everybody's gotta put
their shoulder to the wheel.

1818
01:22:53,446 --> 01:22:55,535
We need participation 24/7.

1819
01:22:55,666 --> 01:22:57,233
We need you to be a force
multiplier.

1820
01:22:57,363 --> 01:23:00,149
As a soldier and as a general,

1821
01:23:00,279 --> 01:23:04,762
as a retired general, we have
an army of digital soldiers.

1822
01:23:04,892 --> 01:23:07,504
If you can do command and
control over social media,

1823
01:23:07,634 --> 01:23:09,245
and you're fighting
against evil,

1824
01:23:09,375 --> 01:23:10,986
and you're on the side of God,

1825
01:23:11,116 --> 01:23:13,423
and you're on the side of the
United States and your oath,

1826
01:23:13,553 --> 01:23:15,468
it's a very attractive
proposition.

1827
01:23:16,513 --> 01:23:17,905
The sad part is,

1828
01:23:18,036 --> 01:23:19,211
is you're using all those
skills and that goodness

1829
01:23:19,342 --> 01:23:20,908
and that purity of heart

1830
01:23:21,039 --> 01:23:24,129
that you think is actually
absolute unadulterated bullshit.

1831
01:23:26,349 --> 01:23:27,654
The second major difference

1832
01:23:27,785 --> 01:23:30,614
is you have political
cover from the very top.

1833
01:23:30,744 --> 01:23:33,660
The only way we're
gonna lose this election

1834
01:23:33,791 --> 01:23:37,099
is if the election is
rigged, remember that.

1835
01:23:37,229 --> 01:23:39,492
January 6th was the
culmination of two months

1836
01:23:39,623 --> 01:23:41,233
of a propagation of a big lie,

1837
01:23:41,364 --> 01:23:42,539
and of conspiracy theories,

1838
01:23:42,669 --> 01:23:45,237
by the president
of the United States.

1839
01:23:45,368 --> 01:23:47,805
Two-thirds of house
Republicans go along with Trump

1840
01:23:47,935 --> 01:23:49,285
and vote to overturn
the electors

1841
01:23:49,415 --> 01:23:51,983
on the evening of January 6th.

1842
01:23:52,114 --> 01:23:53,767
We a United States Senator

1843
01:23:53,898 --> 01:23:55,943
and members of the
House of Representatives

1844
01:23:56,074 --> 01:23:58,250
object to the counting
of the electoral votes

1845
01:23:58,381 --> 01:23:59,773
of the state of Pennsylvania.

1846
01:23:59,904 --> 01:24:02,254
Madam Speaker, I rise
to support the objection.

1847
01:24:02,385 --> 01:24:04,213
Madam Speaker, I rise
to support the objection.

1848
01:24:04,343 --> 01:24:06,650
Madam Speaker, I rise
to support the objection.

1849
01:24:06,780 --> 01:24:09,870
Madam Chair, I vigorously
support this objection.

1850
01:24:10,001 --> 01:24:11,350
And I ask you.

1851
01:24:11,481 --> 01:24:12,569
In a vote that has
always been thought to be

1852
01:24:12,699 --> 01:24:15,876
ceremonial and ministerial,

1853
01:24:16,007 --> 01:24:18,183
where you accept the
electoral college results,

1854
01:24:18,314 --> 01:24:20,142
which were in no serious
way contested.

1855
01:24:20,272 --> 01:24:21,708
I mean, that's almost as
astounding

1856
01:24:21,839 --> 01:24:24,407
as what happened in terms
of the insurrection.

1857
01:24:24,537 --> 01:24:28,411
How can so many people
believe that it was unfair?

1858
01:24:28,541 --> 01:24:30,630
It was because their
president said it was unfair.

1859
01:24:30,761 --> 01:24:32,458
Their senator said it was
unfair.

1860
01:24:32,589 --> 01:24:34,852
Their member of Congress
said it was unfair.

1861
01:24:34,982 --> 01:24:37,376
A full audit is absolutely
necessary.

1862
01:24:37,507 --> 01:24:39,509
We should get injunctions if
necessary.

1863
01:24:39,639 --> 01:24:41,119
And normally those are people

1864
01:24:41,250 --> 01:24:42,860
that the electorate
can have faith in.

1865
01:24:42,990 --> 01:24:46,690
I rise for myself and 60
of my colleagues to object

1866
01:24:46,820 --> 01:24:50,781
to the counting of the
electoral ballots from Arizona.

1867
01:24:50,911 --> 01:24:53,653
Is the objection in writing,
and signed by a senator?

1868
01:24:54,741 --> 01:24:55,829
Yes, it is.

1869
01:24:55,960 --> 01:24:56,830
It is.

1870
01:25:00,356 --> 01:25:02,619
[Narrator] But it is
not just the big lie

1871
01:25:02,749 --> 01:25:06,013
that appears to have captured
much of the Republican party.

1872
01:25:06,144 --> 01:25:08,886
Congressman Denver Riggleman
lost his party's nomination

1873
01:25:09,016 --> 01:25:10,148
over the weekend.

1874
01:25:10,279 --> 01:25:11,671
The first term congressman
was ousted

1875
01:25:11,802 --> 01:25:15,153
by former Liberty University
employee, Bob Good.

1876
01:25:16,415 --> 01:25:17,764
Getting run outta the
Republican party

1877
01:25:17,895 --> 01:25:19,331
was really interesting.

1878
01:25:19,462 --> 01:25:21,333
I believe I was the first
one that was affected

1879
01:25:21,464 --> 01:25:24,162
by Q conspiracy theories
when I didn't even know it.

1880
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:28,471
I had conducted a same sex
wedding in summer of 2019.

1881
01:25:28,601 --> 01:25:30,690
Two guys who had worked
for me, or volunteered.

1882
01:25:30,821 --> 01:25:33,998
And then I started hearing
these weird things.

1883
01:25:34,129 --> 01:25:36,218
I'm funded by George
Soros, I'm a secret Jew,

1884
01:25:36,348 --> 01:25:37,828
I'm a secret Dem.

1885
01:25:37,958 --> 01:25:40,091
I'm trying to change the
sexual orientation of children.

1886
01:25:40,222 --> 01:25:41,397
I'm a tool of the antichrist.

1887
01:25:41,527 --> 01:25:43,094
And I'm hearing all this,

1888
01:25:43,225 --> 01:25:44,922
I'm like, this sounds like
new world order, crazy stuff.

1889
01:25:45,052 --> 01:25:47,054
You know,
the old anti-Semitic tropes.

1890
01:25:48,404 --> 01:25:51,146
[Speaker] You had better
wake up and understand that.

1891
01:25:52,582 --> 01:25:53,844
Then I started doing my own
research

1892
01:25:53,974 --> 01:25:55,062
and I'm pretty good at it.

1893
01:25:55,193 --> 01:25:57,543
And I saw some
of the same patterns

1894
01:25:57,674 --> 01:25:59,241
that you saw with foreign
terrorists, you know,

1895
01:25:59,371 --> 01:26:03,462
and when you chased ISIS
or Al-Qaeda or IED resupply

1896
01:26:03,593 --> 01:26:06,944
from Iraq into Iran,
I've seen some things.

1897
01:26:07,074 --> 01:26:10,817
And what I saw was that
people were using language

1898
01:26:10,948 --> 01:26:13,994
in the open that I thought we
would never see as Americans.

1899
01:26:14,125 --> 01:26:15,431
My two decades of intelligence,

1900
01:26:15,561 --> 01:26:17,259
war fighting and
counter-terrorism experience,

1901
01:26:17,389 --> 01:26:20,566
coupled with serving
in the 116th Congress,

1902
01:26:20,697 --> 01:26:22,829
is why I will not allow
conspiracy peddlers

1903
01:26:22,960 --> 01:26:24,831
to hijack our ability to conduct

1904
01:26:24,962 --> 01:26:26,616
reasonable policy discussions

1905
01:26:26,746 --> 01:26:28,270
for the betterment of all
Americans.

1906
01:26:28,400 --> 01:26:30,881
I was pretty much
drummed out and censured,

1907
01:26:31,011 --> 01:26:33,971
for following the law and
trying to save this country.

1908
01:26:34,101 --> 01:26:36,408
And I'm not, I don't think
I'm overstating that.

1909
01:26:36,539 --> 01:26:39,585
[Crowd] Stop the steal, stop
the steal, stop the steal.

1910
01:26:39,716 --> 01:26:43,198
One of our two parties is
committed to

1911
01:26:43,328 --> 01:26:46,026
an Orwellian whitewashing of
history.

1912
01:26:46,157 --> 01:26:47,463
If you didn't know the TV
footage

1913
01:26:47,593 --> 01:26:49,639
was a video from January the
sixth,

1914
01:26:49,769 --> 01:26:52,163
you would actually think it
was a normal tourist visit.

1915
01:26:52,294 --> 01:26:53,991
Is committed to propagating

1916
01:26:54,121 --> 01:26:57,081
or at least not quarreling
with a big lie.

1917
01:26:57,212 --> 01:27:00,215
The big lie, the big
lie is a lot of bullshit,

1918
01:27:00,345 --> 01:27:01,694
that's what it is.

1919
01:27:01,825 --> 01:27:03,000
[crowd cheering]

1920
01:27:03,130 --> 01:27:04,654
Is committed to not
quarreling much

1921
01:27:04,784 --> 01:27:06,308
with conspiracy theories,

1922
01:27:06,438 --> 01:27:08,614
is committed to purging those
Republicans

1923
01:27:08,745 --> 01:27:11,051
at the state and local level
and at the national level

1924
01:27:11,182 --> 01:27:13,315
who want to fight back
against the lies

1925
01:27:13,445 --> 01:27:14,751
and the conspiracy theories.

1926
01:27:14,881 --> 01:27:15,926
That's a big deal.

1927
01:27:18,276 --> 01:27:20,322
War is literally the
continuation of politics

1928
01:27:20,452 --> 01:27:22,106
by other violent means.

1929
01:27:22,237 --> 01:27:24,543
Our military forces are
the part of our society

1930
01:27:24,674 --> 01:27:26,980
that carries out that piece.

1931
01:27:27,111 --> 01:27:29,069
Then we come home, and the
question is,

1932
01:27:29,200 --> 01:27:31,637
do we have a political
system that functions?

1933
01:27:31,768 --> 01:27:35,119
Or are we at a point
where our own politics,

1934
01:27:35,250 --> 01:27:36,468
the politics inside our own
communities,

1935
01:27:36,599 --> 01:27:38,296
the politics inside our own
country,

1936
01:27:38,427 --> 01:27:40,298
can only be continued through
other means?

1937
01:27:40,429 --> 01:27:41,995
And we gotta be very careful,

1938
01:27:42,126 --> 01:27:43,649
because if you think you have
support

1939
01:27:43,780 --> 01:27:46,043
from the highest levels of
government,

1940
01:27:46,173 --> 01:27:47,436
why aren't you fighting for
your country?

1941
01:27:47,566 --> 01:27:49,568
Aren't you already sort
of sworn in to do this?

1942
01:27:49,699 --> 01:27:51,091
The issue is, is that the people

1943
01:27:51,222 --> 01:27:53,485
that we are identifying as
extremists,

1944
01:27:53,616 --> 01:27:56,140
they're identifying as
patriots or freedom fighters.

1945
01:27:56,271 --> 01:27:57,968
And that is,

1946
01:27:58,098 --> 01:28:00,362
it almost sounds like I'm
talking
about terrorism right now.

1947
01:28:01,406 --> 01:28:05,845
[dark music]
[keyboard clicking]

1948
01:28:05,976 --> 01:28:07,543
One of the organizations

1949
01:28:07,673 --> 01:28:09,501
that I'm particularly
interested in,

1950
01:28:10,067 --> 01:28:11,721
is the Patriot Front.

1951
01:28:23,254 --> 01:28:26,213
They're producing what
they refer to as propaganda.

1952
01:28:26,344 --> 01:28:28,390
They're studying books on
fascism,

1953
01:28:28,520 --> 01:28:31,610
because they believe democracy
has failed,

1954
01:28:31,741 --> 01:28:36,398
and their vision for the
future is a dominant white race

1955
01:28:36,528 --> 01:28:40,140
that has captured the
Republican party

1956
01:28:40,271 --> 01:28:44,231
and has defeated their
political opponents

1957
01:28:44,362 --> 01:28:46,843
by violence or by exclusion.

1958
01:28:49,454 --> 01:28:51,021
These guys showed up in
Philadelphia

1959
01:28:51,151 --> 01:28:55,199
on the 4th of July, 2021 and
assaulted a bunch of people.

1960
01:29:04,121 --> 01:29:05,252
Nothing came of it,

1961
01:29:05,383 --> 01:29:06,515
'cause
the local cops didn't know

1962
01:29:06,645 --> 01:29:08,473
what the hell they
were dealing with.

1963
01:29:09,387 --> 01:29:11,258
So this is a fascist gang

1964
01:29:11,389 --> 01:29:14,697
who's operating
all around the country.

1965
01:29:14,827 --> 01:29:16,699
Police in Idaho say they
prevented

1966
01:29:16,829 --> 01:29:19,528
a possible domestic terror
attack over the weekend.

1967
01:29:19,658 --> 01:29:22,182
31 men were arrested, all
dressed alike,

1968
01:29:22,313 --> 01:29:25,316
allegedly on their way to
wreak havoc at a Pride event

1969
01:29:25,447 --> 01:29:27,100
in the city of Coeur d'Alene.

1970
01:29:27,231 --> 01:29:28,972
[Narrator] Coeur d'Alene
is just a few miles

1971
01:29:29,102 --> 01:29:30,539
north of Hayden Lake,

1972
01:29:30,669 --> 01:29:32,018
and the Patriot Front,

1973
01:29:32,149 --> 01:29:34,456
following in the footsteps of
Louis Beam

1974
01:29:34,586 --> 01:29:36,675
had made it the base of
operations.

1975
01:29:36,806 --> 01:29:38,721
And in the same way Denver
Riggleman

1976
01:29:38,851 --> 01:29:42,855
had been targeted by QAnon
for officiating a gay wedding,

1977
01:29:42,986 --> 01:29:46,816
Q's rhetoric casting the LGBTQ
community

1978
01:29:46,946 --> 01:29:49,384
as groomers and pedophiles

1979
01:29:49,514 --> 01:29:51,908
helped put them squarely in the
sights

1980
01:29:52,038 --> 01:29:54,824
of the white nationalist
Patriot Front.

1981
01:29:54,954 --> 01:29:57,130
While the Proud Boys, the
Oath Keepers,

1982
01:29:57,261 --> 01:29:59,698
the Three Percenters are a
threat.

1983
01:29:59,829 --> 01:30:03,223
The ones that I'm really
afraid of, are the Gen Z ones,

1984
01:30:03,354 --> 01:30:05,312
the service members who have
served

1985
01:30:05,443 --> 01:30:07,010
during a time of relative peace.

1986
01:30:07,140 --> 01:30:09,273
These young people who joined
to fight,

1987
01:30:09,404 --> 01:30:11,014
never got a chance to fight,

1988
01:30:11,144 --> 01:30:15,322
and who, starting in
conservative
echo chambers online,

1989
01:30:15,453 --> 01:30:20,110
have been brought into the
Proud Boy to fascist pipeline.

1990
01:30:20,240 --> 01:30:25,071
So Gab is an alternative
social media platform

1991
01:30:25,202 --> 01:30:29,511
that was created to be a
safe space for neo-Nazis.

1992
01:30:29,641 --> 01:30:32,992
One of the groups on here is
the National Justice Party.

1993
01:30:33,123 --> 01:30:36,779
This is a neo-Nazi party
within the United States,

1994
01:30:36,909 --> 01:30:43,002
whose goal is to use protests
to radicalize Trump supporters

1995
01:30:43,133 --> 01:30:47,398
into explicit white supremacy.

1996
01:30:47,529 --> 01:30:50,619
They're developing new
and original propaganda

1997
01:30:50,749 --> 01:30:53,404
that paint them in a light of
achieving

1998
01:30:53,535 --> 01:30:57,930
the power and the ability
to shape politics,

1999
01:30:58,061 --> 01:31:00,890
and engage in violence in a way

2000
01:31:01,020 --> 01:31:03,893
that they thought they were
gonna get from the military.

2001
01:31:04,023 --> 01:31:08,158
They understand how to recruit
people into that lifestyle.

2002
01:31:08,288 --> 01:31:10,769
So right here, this is
in Italian, "mene frego".

2003
01:31:12,336 --> 01:31:13,903
"I don't care".

2004
01:31:14,033 --> 01:31:18,037
That was the slogan of the
Fascist Party under Mussolini.

2005
01:31:19,212 --> 01:31:22,259
So what they're trying to
do is make white nationalism

2006
01:31:22,389 --> 01:31:26,742
look like it's a
testosterone-filled way to be a
man.

2007
01:31:26,872 --> 01:31:29,701
I believe that these young
veterans who are getting out

2008
01:31:29,832 --> 01:31:31,442
and joining things like Patriot
Front

2009
01:31:31,573 --> 01:31:32,965
and Nationalist Socialist Club,

2010
01:31:33,096 --> 01:31:36,447
and the word Nazi is
nationalist-socialist.

2011
01:31:36,578 --> 01:31:39,189
I think that the Republican
Party is

2012
01:31:40,495 --> 01:31:43,323
more than capable of
adopting that ideology

2013
01:31:43,454 --> 01:31:45,978
in a way that that's
unfathomable even to me.

2014
01:31:46,109 --> 01:31:48,154
You know, I never saw
us where we are today.

2015
01:31:48,285 --> 01:31:51,680
I think another four years,

2016
01:31:51,810 --> 01:31:53,159
things could be far worse.

2017
01:31:54,334 --> 01:31:56,859
[dark music]

2018
01:31:58,730 --> 01:32:00,166
I think the worst case
scenario

2019
01:32:00,297 --> 01:32:03,213
is probably worse than
most of us want to imagine.

2020
01:32:03,343 --> 01:32:04,954
I could see a civil war.

2021
01:32:05,084 --> 01:32:06,346
Because this is the same
movement

2022
01:32:06,477 --> 01:32:08,435
we've been dealing with this
whole time,

2023
01:32:08,566 --> 01:32:10,742
it's reasonable to assume
that what we can see

2024
01:32:10,873 --> 01:32:13,092
is only about half of the
activity,

2025
01:32:13,223 --> 01:32:14,485
that there is an underground

2026
01:32:14,616 --> 01:32:16,052
that is mounting violent action,

2027
01:32:16,182 --> 01:32:17,793
training in camps,

2028
01:32:17,923 --> 01:32:20,578
trying to accumulate weapons
and preparing for violence.

2029
01:32:20,709 --> 01:32:22,275
When you talk about civil war

2030
01:32:22,406 --> 01:32:25,235
or specific sectors of the
country that could go kinetic,

2031
01:32:25,365 --> 01:32:26,584
just go to these areas where
you see

2032
01:32:26,715 --> 01:32:28,325
the first big far left protests.

2033
01:32:28,455 --> 01:32:30,980
When Republicans take
back the house, boom.

2034
01:32:31,110 --> 01:32:32,242
If there's anybody out there

2035
01:32:32,372 --> 01:32:34,853
from Antifa or Black Lives
Matters,

2036
01:32:34,984 --> 01:32:37,856
spend your first fucking
bullet at my chest, okay?

2037
01:32:37,987 --> 01:32:39,423
Or if Republicans think

2038
01:32:39,554 --> 01:32:41,599
that one of the state
elections were stolen, boom.

2039
01:32:41,730 --> 01:32:43,296
Forget writing your
legislators.

2040
01:32:43,427 --> 01:32:44,602
You gotta do something.

2041
01:32:44,733 --> 01:32:46,299
It's us, it's we the people.

2042
01:32:46,430 --> 01:32:48,084
You're gonna have to take my
life.

2043
01:32:48,214 --> 01:32:49,564
There's no way, I'll die on
this hill.

2044
01:32:49,694 --> 01:32:51,566
There's no way, no way.

2045
01:32:51,696 --> 01:32:53,002
All of this can happen.

2046
01:32:53,132 --> 01:32:55,178
Who's to say that if
legislation came down

2047
01:32:55,308 --> 01:32:57,397
where we lost our second
amendment tomorrow,

2048
01:32:57,528 --> 01:32:59,530
that that wouldn't start a
civil war?

2049
01:32:59,661 --> 01:33:01,271
To be honest with you,

2050
01:33:01,401 --> 01:33:02,968
I don't know of any veteran
that wants war in this country.

2051
01:33:03,099 --> 01:33:04,491
But at the very same time,

2052
01:33:04,622 --> 01:33:06,842
when you look back to
what our founding fathers

2053
01:33:06,972 --> 01:33:08,626
wanted for this country,

2054
01:33:08,757 --> 01:33:10,367
we are so far away
from that today.

2055
01:33:10,497 --> 01:33:11,803
It's just something
they're ready for,

2056
01:33:11,934 --> 01:33:13,675
and their gun safe is full.

2057
01:33:16,852 --> 01:33:17,940
If you're prepared,
you're prepared,

2058
01:33:18,070 --> 01:33:19,419
and if you're not, you're not.

2059
01:33:19,550 --> 01:33:21,726
If you're armed, then
you're somewhat prepared

2060
01:33:21,857 --> 01:33:23,772
to defend your family and
yourself.

2061
01:33:23,902 --> 01:33:26,426
If you're not armed,
you're dog meat.

2062
01:33:29,908 --> 01:33:31,344
There's imminent civil war.

2063
01:33:31,475 --> 01:33:32,650
If we don't fix our elections

2064
01:33:32,781 --> 01:33:34,913
and actually make
them bonafide again,

2065
01:33:35,044 --> 01:33:36,219
we don't have 2024.

2066
01:33:37,655 --> 01:33:39,570
There is no 2024.

2067
01:33:39,701 --> 01:33:41,790
[Narrator] But it is
the election of 2024

2068
01:33:41,920 --> 01:33:43,618
that opens up a different front,

2069
01:33:43,748 --> 01:33:48,057
one that is potentially as
dangerous as a violent civil
war.

2070
01:33:48,187 --> 01:33:49,928
There are people in
this movement who believe

2071
01:33:50,059 --> 01:33:52,365
that the nation cannot
be saved as it is,

2072
01:33:52,496 --> 01:33:53,758
and must be overthrown

2073
01:33:53,889 --> 01:33:55,891
in order to make way
for a white ethno-state.

2074
01:33:56,021 --> 01:33:57,936
And then there are probably
people in this movement

2075
01:33:58,067 --> 01:33:59,329
who think, aha,

2076
01:33:59,459 --> 01:34:01,200
there's an opening here to run
for office,

2077
01:34:01,331 --> 01:34:03,986
and mount a sort
of coup from inside

2078
01:34:04,116 --> 01:34:06,728
in order to change the
very nature of the nation.

2079
01:34:06,858 --> 01:34:08,512
Now, I worry about scenarios
in which,

2080
01:34:08,643 --> 01:34:11,820
in 2024, one party controls
Congress.

2081
01:34:11,950 --> 01:34:13,430
The other party wins a
presidential election.

2082
01:34:13,560 --> 01:34:15,301
Congress refuses to certify the
election.

2083
01:34:15,432 --> 01:34:18,087
The Republican party has
a pretty systematic plan

2084
01:34:18,217 --> 01:34:20,785
to have state legislatures
impose themselves

2085
01:34:20,916 --> 01:34:23,832
much more directly into the
certification of electors,

2086
01:34:23,962 --> 01:34:25,921
to perhaps also suppress
some democratic votes

2087
01:34:26,051 --> 01:34:27,357
along the way.

2088
01:34:27,487 --> 01:34:29,576
So I do think the
chances of a real attempt

2089
01:34:29,707 --> 01:34:33,363
to overturn a legitimate
election result are not nothing,

2090
01:34:33,493 --> 01:34:35,104
and they're not tiny.

2091
01:34:35,234 --> 01:34:37,715
And then somebody as president
or people that are elected

2092
01:34:37,846 --> 01:34:40,413
that aren't there in a legal
way.

2093
01:34:40,544 --> 01:34:42,067
And then that's when the
dissent happens,

2094
01:34:42,198 --> 01:34:44,200
and that's the end of our
country and our legal norms.

2095
01:34:44,330 --> 01:34:46,202
And that scares
the hell outta me.

2096
01:34:46,332 --> 01:34:48,378
This country,
you as individuals

2097
01:34:48,508 --> 01:34:49,727
with the individual liberties

2098
01:34:49,858 --> 01:34:51,424
and the individual rights that
you have,

2099
01:34:51,555 --> 01:34:53,165
you need to start assuming risk

2100
01:34:53,296 --> 01:34:56,429
for your neighborhoods and your
communities and your towns.

2101
01:34:56,560 --> 01:34:58,127
You have to get involved.

2102
01:34:58,257 --> 01:35:01,304
General Flynn's ultimate
plan is to undermine democracy,

2103
01:35:01,434 --> 01:35:04,655
is to get his digital soldiers

2104
01:35:04,786 --> 01:35:08,093
to radicalize the rest
of the Republican base.

2105
01:35:08,224 --> 01:35:10,008
Go run for dog catcher.

2106
01:35:10,139 --> 01:35:11,923
If you don't like this, who's
running your school board?

2107
01:35:12,054 --> 01:35:13,664
Go run for the school board.

2108
01:35:13,795 --> 01:35:15,710
If you don't like who's
running your little town

2109
01:35:15,840 --> 01:35:18,713
or your little parish,
go get involved.

2110
01:35:18,843 --> 01:35:21,237
If Flynn can convince his
followers

2111
01:35:21,367 --> 01:35:24,414
to push enough good
people out of government,

2112
01:35:24,544 --> 01:35:26,851
they'll beat us into submission.

2113
01:35:26,982 --> 01:35:28,244
I don't want guys like

2114
01:35:28,374 --> 01:35:31,073
disgraced former General
Michael Flynn

2115
01:35:31,203 --> 01:35:34,816
to be deciding who's an
American and who's not.

2116
01:35:34,946 --> 01:35:36,426
General Flynn, do you believe

2117
01:35:36,556 --> 01:35:39,603
the violence on January 6th was
justified?

2118
01:35:41,736 --> 01:35:46,610
Because their movement
is about excluding others.

2119
01:35:46,741 --> 01:35:50,135
It's not about
the will of the people.

2120
01:35:50,266 --> 01:35:52,616
It's about suppressing
opposition.

2121
01:35:52,747 --> 01:35:54,531
It's about power.

2122
01:35:54,661 --> 01:35:56,707
General Flynn, do you believe
in the peaceful transition

2123
01:35:56,838 --> 01:36:00,232
of power in the United States
of America?

2124
01:36:01,843 --> 01:36:04,236
This is how countries fall
apart.

2125
01:36:04,367 --> 01:36:05,977
Part of my experience as a
veteran,

2126
01:36:06,108 --> 01:36:07,457
and as somebody who's worked
with refugees

2127
01:36:07,587 --> 01:36:08,893
and done human rights work,

2128
01:36:09,024 --> 01:36:11,983
I know what happens when
the center cannot hold

2129
01:36:12,114 --> 01:36:14,246
and a society falls apart.

2130
01:36:14,377 --> 01:36:16,814
I know what happens when
your ethnic identity

2131
01:36:16,945 --> 01:36:18,468
or your in-group out-group
membership

2132
01:36:18,598 --> 01:36:20,470
becomes a life and death issue,

2133
01:36:20,600 --> 01:36:23,429
and when neighbors start killing
each other, I've seen it.

2134
01:36:23,560 --> 01:36:26,215
And whatever your Twitter
bravado

2135
01:36:26,345 --> 01:36:29,392
about the next civil war is,
nobody wants to see that.

2136
01:36:29,522 --> 01:36:30,785
That is the road to hell.

2137
01:36:30,915 --> 01:36:32,787
The very worst case scenario

2138
01:36:32,917 --> 01:36:36,268
is that we slide to
authoritarianism,

2139
01:36:36,399 --> 01:36:38,705
that we are not able

2140
01:36:38,836 --> 01:36:41,012
to climb out of this.

2141
01:36:41,143 --> 01:36:44,494
We have seen this happen
over and over and over again

2142
01:36:44,624 --> 01:36:46,104
in other countries.

2143
01:36:46,235 --> 01:36:50,543
We have seen them fight
back against the first wave,

2144
01:36:50,805 --> 01:36:52,328
and not be ready for the second,

2145
01:36:52,458 --> 01:36:54,809
and not be ready for the third.

2146
01:36:54,939 --> 01:36:56,985
This is gonna take a long time,

2147
01:36:57,115 --> 01:36:59,422
and it's going to take
everything we have

2148
01:36:59,552 --> 01:37:00,815
to make sure that our democracy

2149
01:37:00,945 --> 01:37:02,512
is still standing at the end of
it.

2150
01:37:02,642 --> 01:37:04,557
I hope that people are
fucking scared,

2151
01:37:04,688 --> 01:37:07,952
because being scared motivates
people.

2152
01:37:08,083 --> 01:37:11,042
And I want you to be
scared by what's true.

2153
01:37:11,173 --> 01:37:13,001
And I want you to look at
evidence.

2154
01:37:13,131 --> 01:37:14,698
I want you to think critically,

2155
01:37:14,829 --> 01:37:16,265
and do everything within your
power

2156
01:37:16,395 --> 01:37:19,877
and within the confines of the
law

2157
01:37:20,008 --> 01:37:21,183
to make sure that we don't live

2158
01:37:21,313 --> 01:37:22,575
in that dystopian future,

2159
01:37:22,706 --> 01:37:24,534
that could just be a few years
away.

2160
01:37:30,540 --> 01:37:32,672
I went to my son's grave site,

2161
01:37:32,803 --> 01:37:34,849
and I just felt so helpless.

2162
01:37:34,979 --> 01:37:37,460
It made me angry that
my son's sacrifice

2163
01:37:37,590 --> 01:37:38,983
almost felt like it was in vain.

2164
01:37:39,114 --> 01:37:41,638
Now I've refocused and I
had to take a look at it,

2165
01:37:41,768 --> 01:37:43,161
and I had to do a lot of soul
searching

2166
01:37:43,292 --> 01:37:45,250
to understand that that's not
the case.

2167
01:37:49,602 --> 01:37:52,344
And this fight is not over.

2168
01:37:52,475 --> 01:37:54,303
It's far from over and
it may never be over.

2169
01:37:54,433 --> 01:37:56,435
But his sacrifice is not in
vain.

2170
01:37:57,567 --> 01:38:00,265
My service, the service of
everyone
else, of all Americans,

2171
01:38:00,396 --> 01:38:01,701
regardless if you wore a uniform

2172
01:38:01,832 --> 01:38:02,920
as long as you got up in the
morning,

2173
01:38:03,051 --> 01:38:04,487
you just tried to do the right
thing.

2174
01:38:04,617 --> 01:38:06,054
It's not in vain.

2175
01:38:06,184 --> 01:38:07,794
What if every young American

2176
01:38:07,925 --> 01:38:09,492
did national service for a year,

2177
01:38:09,622 --> 01:38:11,886
maybe in uniform, but not
necessarily?

2178
01:38:12,756 --> 01:38:15,715
What if they did it in
healthcare,
conservation, education,

2179
01:38:15,846 --> 01:38:18,936
how would they feel about
each other at the end of that?

2180
01:38:19,067 --> 01:38:22,157
By experience we know you
almost always feel different,

2181
01:38:22,287 --> 01:38:23,854
more tightly, you break down

2182
01:38:23,985 --> 01:38:28,554
many of your preconceived
prejudices against other groups.

2183
01:38:28,685 --> 01:38:30,382
Trust starts to build.

2184
01:38:32,994 --> 01:38:37,955
In 2013, I first applied to
my local community college.

2185
01:38:41,480 --> 01:38:45,354
Having had my military
experience turn out so negative,

2186
01:38:45,484 --> 01:38:47,747
I'll be honest, my
confidence was destroyed,

2187
01:38:47,878 --> 01:38:51,099
and I was like terrified
of registering for classes,

2188
01:38:51,229 --> 01:38:53,275
because I was terrified of
failure.

2189
01:38:53,405 --> 01:38:56,408
And I went over the course
of my first semester

2190
01:38:56,539 --> 01:38:58,889
at Nassau Community College,

2191
01:38:59,020 --> 01:39:01,457
fulfilling a lot of bad
stereotypes about veterans.

2192
01:39:01,587 --> 01:39:04,155
You know, coming in,
having my headphones on,

2193
01:39:04,286 --> 01:39:05,635
having my hoodie over my head,

2194
01:39:05,765 --> 01:39:08,029
and just like sitting down,

2195
01:39:08,159 --> 01:39:10,422
not talking to anybody, not
engaging.

2196
01:39:10,553 --> 01:39:13,599
And a group of student veterans
at my community college

2197
01:39:13,730 --> 01:39:15,427
identified that,

2198
01:39:15,558 --> 01:39:17,125
recognized that it was a
problem,

2199
01:39:17,255 --> 01:39:18,996
and helped to break me of my
shell.

2200
01:39:21,085 --> 01:39:23,522
I went from being that guy
who doesn't talk to anybody

2201
01:39:23,653 --> 01:39:26,351
and sits in the corner to
being elected to represent

2202
01:39:26,482 --> 01:39:28,179
all of the student veterans at
my school.

2203
01:39:28,310 --> 01:39:31,226
Student Veterans of Nassau is a
chapter

2204
01:39:31,356 --> 01:39:32,749
of Student Veterans of America.

2205
01:39:32,879 --> 01:39:35,926
It's a national organization
focused on basically

2206
01:39:36,057 --> 01:39:37,536
easing people into the
transition

2207
01:39:37,667 --> 01:39:40,148
from combat to college to
careers.

2208
01:39:40,278 --> 01:39:42,367
One of the things that
the Veterans Center does,

2209
01:39:42,498 --> 01:39:46,110
is it allows for us to get
back into an environment

2210
01:39:46,241 --> 01:39:47,372
that we we're familiar with.

2211
01:39:47,503 --> 01:39:49,157
It gives us a sense of
camaraderie

2212
01:39:49,287 --> 01:39:51,811
that we really miss from the
military.

2213
01:39:51,942 --> 01:39:53,726
It's not something that
happened overnight,

2214
01:39:53,857 --> 01:39:56,033
but it set me on the
path towards recovery.

2215
01:39:56,164 --> 01:40:00,255
And rather than feel like
the future was predetermined

2216
01:40:00,385 --> 01:40:01,604
by these powerful groups,

2217
01:40:01,734 --> 01:40:02,909
and that there was nothing that
I could do

2218
01:40:03,040 --> 01:40:03,954
to fight against them.

2219
01:40:04,085 --> 01:40:06,609
I started to accept the idea of

2220
01:40:06,739 --> 01:40:08,959
maybe the truth is
somewhere in the middle.

2221
01:40:09,090 --> 01:40:12,354
And because most of my
interactions with the outside
world

2222
01:40:12,484 --> 01:40:14,530
were in person, person to
person,

2223
01:40:14,660 --> 01:40:18,925
I wasn't as easily able to
seek out an echo chamber

2224
01:40:19,056 --> 01:40:20,797
that didn't challenge my
opinions,

2225
01:40:20,927 --> 01:40:23,234
that only reinforced my beliefs.

2226
01:40:23,365 --> 01:40:26,759
That diversity of opinion
is what kept me from

2227
01:40:26,890 --> 01:40:29,414
joining the Oath Keepers
when it first sprang up,

2228
01:40:29,545 --> 01:40:31,242
it helped to break me out of it.

2229
01:40:32,461 --> 01:40:34,158
A lot of veterans getting out,

2230
01:40:34,289 --> 01:40:35,942
they don't have that
opportunity.

2231
01:40:36,073 --> 01:40:37,422
We're in a different world.

2232
01:40:38,597 --> 01:40:40,251
In this new world,

2233
01:40:40,382 --> 01:40:44,255
our troops have to be trained
to not only defend themselves

2234
01:40:44,386 --> 01:40:48,607
against a Chinese sniper
or a Russian tank,

2235
01:40:49,695 --> 01:40:54,048
but against enemy disinformation
campaigns on the internet.

2236
01:40:54,178 --> 01:40:56,441
It's also true that
disinformation

2237
01:40:56,572 --> 01:41:00,489
is not just coming from China
and Russia.

2238
01:41:00,619 --> 01:41:04,884
We know how to combat
malicious misinformation.

2239
01:41:05,015 --> 01:41:09,193
We did a pretty good job
teaching soldiers and citizens

2240
01:41:09,324 --> 01:41:11,717
how to not fall for Nazi
propaganda.

2241
01:41:11,848 --> 01:41:14,851
We did a pretty good job
teaching soldiers and citizens

2242
01:41:14,981 --> 01:41:16,635
how to not fall for communist
propaganda

2243
01:41:16,766 --> 01:41:18,028
all through the Cold War.

2244
01:41:19,247 --> 01:41:21,553
The problem with that, of
course, is that,

2245
01:41:21,684 --> 01:41:23,860
opposition to the Nazis
was a goal shared

2246
01:41:23,990 --> 01:41:25,340
by both political parties in
America.

2247
01:41:25,470 --> 01:41:28,212
Opposition to the Soviet
Union was a goal shared

2248
01:41:28,343 --> 01:41:30,910
by most across the political
spectrum in America.

2249
01:41:31,041 --> 01:41:34,262
Right now, this conflict,
it's far too partisan,

2250
01:41:34,392 --> 01:41:36,786
it's far too divisive and
it's far too politicized.

2251
01:41:36,916 --> 01:41:39,354
We know how to do this,
but it takes unity.

2252
01:41:39,484 --> 01:41:41,399
And this is a layer cake of
problems.

2253
01:41:41,530 --> 01:41:43,706
This is something that does not
just exist

2254
01:41:43,836 --> 01:41:46,491
at say DOD policy level.

2255
01:41:46,622 --> 01:41:49,103
This is about how journalists
talk about the movement,

2256
01:41:49,233 --> 01:41:51,192
how our laws prosecute the
movement,

2257
01:41:51,322 --> 01:41:55,196
how our national leaders direct
their time and attention.

2258
01:41:55,326 --> 01:41:58,460
We know that there is
a lack of political will

2259
01:41:58,590 --> 01:42:03,291
to establish or to create
a domestic terrorism law.

2260
01:42:03,421 --> 01:42:06,555
Yet I think there is a big
possibility

2261
01:42:06,685 --> 01:42:09,210
that we can designate these
groups

2262
01:42:09,340 --> 01:42:11,951
as international terrorist
organizations.

2263
01:42:12,082 --> 01:42:17,522
So what that means, we
can take all the rules,

2264
01:42:18,349 --> 01:42:20,960
the laws, the authorities,

2265
01:42:21,091 --> 01:42:22,832
that the FBI and other law
enforcement

2266
01:42:22,962 --> 01:42:26,662
and intelligence agencies
have to go after them,

2267
01:42:26,792 --> 01:42:28,968
the same way we go after

2268
01:42:29,099 --> 01:42:31,101
international terrorist
organizations.

2269
01:42:31,232 --> 01:42:32,885
Who's paid a price?

2270
01:42:33,016 --> 01:42:34,713
Who's paid a price for being

2271
01:42:34,844 --> 01:42:38,326
a conspiratorial irresponsible
demagogic extremist?

2272
01:42:38,456 --> 01:42:40,545
With the exception of a few
true believers

2273
01:42:40,676 --> 01:42:43,200
who were just duped and taken in

2274
01:42:43,331 --> 01:42:45,333
and foolishly believed all this
stuff,

2275
01:42:45,463 --> 01:42:48,901
most of them are going about
going along, doing fine.

2276
01:42:49,032 --> 01:42:52,209
Voters need to decide
whether they are comfortable

2277
01:42:52,340 --> 01:42:56,082
with those who incite
violence representing them,

2278
01:42:56,213 --> 01:43:00,086
and movements like this end,

2279
01:43:00,217 --> 01:43:03,133
when the entire
population decides

2280
01:43:03,264 --> 01:43:05,309
that they are unacceptable.

2281
01:43:05,440 --> 01:43:06,876
We haven't seen that yet.

2282
01:43:08,530 --> 01:43:11,359
[dark music]

2283
01:43:11,489 --> 01:43:13,535
So the ideal solution
is de-radicalization,

2284
01:43:13,665 --> 01:43:15,624
but that's not something
I'm interested in.

2285
01:43:15,754 --> 01:43:19,018
I'm interested in justice,

2286
01:43:19,149 --> 01:43:21,891
and I'm interested
in imposing costs

2287
01:43:22,021 --> 01:43:25,155
on people who are trying to
hurt America and Americans.

2288
01:43:26,156 --> 01:43:28,463
All I think about all
day is finding bad guys

2289
01:43:28,593 --> 01:43:30,508
and hoping that
they end up in jail,

2290
01:43:30,639 --> 01:43:33,859
documenting any potentially
criminal behavior,

2291
01:43:33,990 --> 01:43:36,993
documenting things that
if they're not illegal,

2292
01:43:37,123 --> 01:43:39,865
society would frown upon.

2293
01:43:39,996 --> 01:43:42,781
And ultimately it's to put a
cost behind

2294
01:43:42,912 --> 01:43:47,221
being an insurgent
within the United States.

2295
01:43:47,351 --> 01:43:49,440
I'm a Nazi hunter.

2296
01:43:49,571 --> 01:43:50,702
But it doesn't mean we're
gonna win,

2297
01:43:50,833 --> 01:43:52,704
and that's what I want to tell
people.

2298
01:43:53,749 --> 01:43:55,185
Good doesn't always triumph,

2299
01:43:55,316 --> 01:43:57,666
but I do believe the oath means
something.

2300
01:43:57,796 --> 01:44:00,669
And I know that I'm going
directly against people

2301
01:44:00,799 --> 01:44:02,888
who think that they also
are honoring their oath

2302
01:44:03,019 --> 01:44:04,455
in the same way.

2303
01:44:04,586 --> 01:44:06,631
And that's why I think
this makes this dangerous.

2304
01:44:06,762 --> 01:44:09,286
But what's enabling
that schism to happen,

2305
01:44:11,941 --> 01:44:13,551
is the lie.

2306
01:44:13,682 --> 01:44:16,380
Which world of truth do you
live in?

2307
01:44:16,511 --> 01:44:18,817
It's not about commitment
to country, that's shared.

2308
01:44:18,948 --> 01:44:20,732
So the only way to get back
together,

2309
01:44:20,863 --> 01:44:23,257
the only possibility of
reconciliation

2310
01:44:23,387 --> 01:44:26,869
is a conversation that can occur
in an environment of truth.

2311
01:44:26,999 --> 01:44:30,176
We can either reconcile with
with each other as a country,

2312
01:44:30,307 --> 01:44:32,178
or we can have a conflict.

2313
01:44:32,309 --> 01:44:33,919
Where do I want America to go?

2314
01:44:35,312 --> 01:44:37,096
Not here, not where we're at.

2315
01:44:37,880 --> 01:44:39,142
This path we're on will kill us.

2316
01:44:39,273 --> 01:44:40,622
It'll kill this country.

2317
01:44:40,752 --> 01:44:42,450
It'll kill freedom,
it'll kill our comradery,

2318
01:44:42,580 --> 01:44:44,278
it'll kill our compassion

2319
01:44:44,408 --> 01:44:46,671
and our human decency for each
other.

2320
01:44:46,802 --> 01:44:49,587
What I'd like to see is for
the people on both sides,

2321
01:44:49,718 --> 01:44:53,678
all come together and agree
on going by the truth only.

2322
01:44:54,679 --> 01:44:57,769
If we can do that, then
this nation can be salvaged.

2323
01:44:57,900 --> 01:44:59,249
Do I see that happening?

2324
01:45:00,729 --> 01:45:01,599
No, I don't.

2325
01:45:02,905 --> 01:45:04,123
I can hope though.

2326
01:45:06,387 --> 01:45:09,172
