1
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:33,640
<i>All drivers to your cars, please.
All drivers to your cars.</i>

2
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:19,240
- Distracted?
- No, that's not exactly right.

3
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,720
Your son seems to be interested
in only one thing.

4
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,440
All he talks about

5
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,600
all he seems capable
of thinking about

6
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,320
is automobile racing.

7
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:30,280
Well, you know,
his father designs racing cars.

8
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,800
- And where is your husband?
- Working.

9
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:35,000
He couldn't be here.

10
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,080
Perhaps the apple hasn't fallen
very far from the tree.

11
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,120
Is your husband's name Rex?

12
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,200
No, that's his older brother, Rex.
Why?

13
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,960
This is the test he turned
in last week.

14
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:56,960
Bang!

15
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,880
All right, pencils down.

16
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,000
Take your answer sheets

17
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,960
place it into the first part
of your booklet

18
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:54,440
pack up your things
and bring your... to my desk.

19
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,520
Speed Racer, slow down!

20
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,760
Take it you're ready to go?

21
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,560
- How was school?
- Fine.

22
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:22,040
Are you going to the track?
Mom said you were.

23
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,360
You don't have to drop me off.
I could just go with you.

24
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,520
- No way.
- Oh, come on. Take me with you.

25
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,120
- Come on, please.
- I can't, Speed.

26
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,560
- Pops would kill me.
- He doesn't have to know.

27
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,400
I won't say anything.
Nobody will know.

28
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:41,960
Come on, please, Rex, please...

29
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,000
Are you wearing the socks?

30
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:54,480
Okay. But if you roll us again,
this'll be the last time.

31
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,520
Deal?

32
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:57,680
<i>Deal.</i>

33
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,280
Oh, yeah!

34
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:20,960
Come on!

35
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,640
Yeah!

36
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:24,960
You feel that shimmy?

37
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,896
It's your hind legs
trying to outrun your front.

38
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:28,920
What do I do?

39
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,760
You stop steering
and you start driving.

40
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,760
This ain't no dead piece of metal.

41
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,480
Car is a living, breathing thing,
all right?

42
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,560
She's alive.

43
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,576
You can feel her talking to you

44
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,096
telling you what she wants,
what she needs.

45
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,200
All you gotta do is listen.

46
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,040
Close your eyes and listen.

47
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,280
You know, they say
that Ben Burns drove the final lap

48
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,976
of the Vanderbilt Cup
with his eyes closed.

49
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,360
- No way!
- No?

50
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,520
Maybe you just can't hear it, then.

51
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,176
Maybe you ought to start
hitting those books.

52
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,760
- No! I hear it!
- Oh, is that so, Mr. Burns?

53
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,760
All right. Tell me when to punch it
for the jump.

54
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,160
Now?

55
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,600
Now!

56
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,040
Local fan favorite, Speed Racer,
is gobbling up this track.

57
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,720
(Italian)

58
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,776
(Japanese) Competing in the Grand
Prix is not a dream out of reach.

59
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,200
(Russian)
He's a new rising star in the sky.

60
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:54,680
Let us hope he does not make
the same mistakes

61
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:55,880
that his brother made.

62
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,880
Heads up, Speed. Seven o'clock.

63
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,240
I got Snake drafting Pitter Pat.

64
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:08,960
I got him.

65
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,520
I figure he'll slingshot after you
in the next turn.

66
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,640
I'm ready.

67
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,200
Great move, Speed!

68
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,456
All right, watch out
for the dog balls coming up.

69
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,840
You may want to ease off a little.

70
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,640
Not this time, Sparky.

71
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,640
Holy cannoli, Speed.

72
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,200
<i>- You know who you're racing?</i>
- Yeah.

73
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,960
Rex is gonna win it, ain't he, Pops?

74
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,360
Nobody's gonna catch him.
He's gonna win it.

75
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,760
He's gonna set the course record.

76
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,960
- Nobody's gonna stop him.
- Quiet, Speed.

77
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,320
- There's still a lot of race to go.
- No way. It's over.

78
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,160
My brother's the best racer
in the world.

79
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,840
Everyone else is running for second.

80
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,120
Yeah!

81
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,160
I told you to take him out!

82
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,720
We're trying, sir, we're trying,
but he's just too fast.

83
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,400
It's unbelievable, folks!

84
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,400
No one has seen moves like this

85
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,520
since that remarkable night
eight years ago.

86
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,696
There's no doubt in my mind.
He's gunning for the record.

87
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,576
(Russian) The record that was held
for the last eight years...

88
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,640
He is not alone out there,
he is chasing someone.

89
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,800
He is chasing the ghost of Rex Racer.

90
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:28,360
Jeepers, he could do it, Pops.
He could really do it.

91
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,440
What if he does it?
What if he does it, Pops?

92
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,640
I don't know if I can watch this.

93
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,360
There's that Speed Racer.

94
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,520
My daddy told me
that his daddy used to work

95
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:07,200
for the Mishida Motorworks
but he quit.

96
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:10,680
My daddy told me that it was
a completely crazy thing to do.

97
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,800
He says the whole family is crazy.

98
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,360
Speed's not crazy.

99
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,360
No. He's just dumb.

100
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,240
Probably the dumbest kid
in the class.

101
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:21,880
Mrs. Waterstraat had me
alphabetize the IRB tests

102
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,800
and you wouldn't believe
what the retard did...

103
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Speed!

104
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,320
Speed!

105
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,480
Are you all right?

106
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,720
Who are you?

107
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:56,280
I'm Trixie. I'm in your class.

108
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:57,760
Oh, yeah.

109
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:01,160
Hey, you wanna see my car collection?

110
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,160
I'd love to.

111
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,960
- Hey, Rex. Hey, Pops.
- Hey, Speedy.

112
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:16,280
- Who's your friend?
- Her name's Trixie.

113
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,960
- She's in my class.
- Hi.

114
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,440
Pleasure to meet you... young lady.

115
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,840
Hey, Pops, a guy told me
to give this to you.

116
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:25,760
- Says he was a big fan.
- Oh, a fan, is it?

117
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,176
Well, it's not every day
we get people

118
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,960
with such good taste around here.
Where is he?

119
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,320
He was in a hurry,
driving a '68 Fendersin.

120
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,400
- Sweet set of wheels.
- Let me see that.

121
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,560
Cool beans.

122
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,200
No one
from these parts will ever forget

123
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,080
the tragic story of Rex Racer.

124
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:04,160
(Japanese) How can anyone
forget about the incident?

125
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,760
He nearly ruined racing.

126
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:08,120
One of the bravest men
to ever drive a racecar.

127
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,200
(French)

128
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,800
<i>Can I come with you, Rex?</i>

129
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,160
Not this time, Speedy.

130
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,840
When are you coming back?

131
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:24,640
I don't know. I don't know.

132
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,680
Hey. There's something I want you
to have.

133
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,160
But the Mach Five's your car.

134
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,240
Not anymore.

135
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,280
Look, Speed.

136
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,280
One day, people might say things
about me.

137
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:52,680
But no matter what they say,
I just...

138
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,760
Look, I hope you never believe them.

139
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:58,760
I won't.

140
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:02,560
Come here.

141
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,640
So, you're quitting?

142
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,120
I have to.

143
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,520
No, you don't.

144
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:18,360
This is a choice. You're selling out.

145
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:21,000
Turning your back
on everything we've built here.

146
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:24,760
- I'm done arguing with you, Pops.
- Don't you turn your back on me.

147
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,080
You can't tell me what to do.
It's my life to live.

148
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,600
You walk out that door now,
you better not ever come back.

149
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,880
<i>Rex Racer, driving the black
and red Uniron car</i>

150
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:51,760
<i>got into a tangle with Richenbach,
who was favored to win.</i>

151
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:54,000
<i>Come on, that was no tangle.
He took Richenbach out.</i>

152
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,456
<i>Well, we don't know that,
but I imagine</i>

153
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,640
<i>the WRL will be reviewing this crash.</i>

154
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:00,000
<i>That's the third DNF crash
Racer's been involved in.</i>

155
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:02,376
- Turn it off, Speed.
<i>- Heck, they oughta just suspend him.</i>

156
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,456
<i>- Well, that's...</i>
- I don't want you

157
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,736
- watching this anymore.
<i>- Racer's career if he found guilty.</i>

158
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,560
The trial of Rex Racer shook
the World Racing League

159
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:09,760
to its very foundation.

160
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,920
Once a rat, always a rat

161
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,480
and in my book,
Rex Racer's nothing but a rat.

162
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:19,440
<i>Did you see that?
That will definitely leave a mark.</i>

163
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:23,360
<i>And Rex Racer nearly took
Yokima's head off with that jump.</i>

164
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,000
<i>Hey, there is no doubt in my mind
that Rex Racer</i>

165
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:28,560
<i>is one of the dirtiest drivers
in the world.</i>

166
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:31,560
For five years, Rex Racer took orders
from the criminal underworld.

167
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:37,200
(Italian)

168
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:41,160
- Fight...
- Fight...

169
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,600
- Fight...
- No! You stop this!

170
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,280
- You stop it right now!
- I just told him the truth!

171
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:49,880
His crum bum brother doesn't belong
on a race track, he belongs in jail!

172
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,000
- Hey!
- Speed.

173
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,320
The indictment brought down

174
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,840
the perennial racing powerhouse,
Uniron.

175
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,800
Uniron was linked
to the notorious fixer

176
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,000
Blackjack Benelli.

177
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,760
Still in prison today

178
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,840
Benelli was rumored to be behind
the Casa Cristo tragedy.

179
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:10,000
<i>This is one of the worst crashes
I have ever...</i>

180
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,560
<i>How could this happen?</i>

181
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:17,240
<i>This is terrible.
This is just terrible.</i>

182
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,640
<i>And still no sign
of driver Rex Racer.</i>

183
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,000
(Italian)

184
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:55,160
(Russian) He shoots ahead!
What the hell is he doing?

185
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:58,520
- (Italian)
- (Russian) This is my night.

186
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,920
- (Italian)
- (Russian)

187
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,720
"Forget the past," he's saying.
"This is my night!"

188
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:18,040
- He's coming hard.
- It's gonna be close!

189
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,600
<i>What a race!</i>

190
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,760
- (Italian)
- (Russian) So close!

191
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:36,960
Unbelievable!

192
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,760
A split second late.

193
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,800
The record still stands.

194
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,720
Come on. Let's go. Victory Lane.

195
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:55,320
<i>Folks, I knew Rex Racer,
and if he's up there somewhere</i>

196
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:58,280
<i>watching this race,
you can bet your ass</i>

197
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:00,480
<i>he's damn proud
of his little brother.</i>

198
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:05,720
<i>Pulling into Victory Lane,
the winner, Speed Racer!</i>

199
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,800
He's going to be very good.

200
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,120
No, he's going to be the best...

201
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,560
if they don't destroy him first.

202
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,720
Hey, hey! What are you two doing?

203
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Nothing.

204
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:07,400
Was that the same nothing
that broke my last couch?

205
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:10,440
Naw. That was
a totally different nothing.

206
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,400
Got it!

207
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,360
- Racer residence.
<i>- Good morning.</i>

208
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,520
<i>May I speak to Speed Racer?</i>

209
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:19,040
- He's not interested.
- Spritle?

210
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,960
- What?
- Was that for Speed?

211
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:23,480
Yeah. But Speed doesn't want
to talk to them.

212
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:25,960
- You don't know that.
- Sure, I do.

213
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:28,400
Speed's gotta drive for Pops.
He's gotta.

214
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,120
Well, that's for Speed to decide.

215
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,960
Now get dressed.
Tell your father breakfast is ready.

216
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,120
"It was a virtuoso display of talent
the likes of which has not been seen

217
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,680
at Thunderhead since Racer, the Elder

218
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,200
dropped jaws eight years ago.

219
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,520
Now, as we once again pull

220
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,600
our collective jaw up from the floor
we have to ask

221
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,536
"Will it be different this time
or will tragedy..."

222
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:46,560
That's enough.

223
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,456
I just can't believe
there's not one mention

224
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,560
of Racer Motors in here.

225
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:53,440
That's because the sponsors control
the media, Sparky.

226
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,800
- Morning, everyone.
- Good morning.

227
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:58,440
- Is Speed up yet?
- In spirit, anyway.

228
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:02,240
- Oh, thanks. Hey, Superstar.
- Hey, Trix.

229
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,120
Have you seen the papers
this morning?

230
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:05,960
- They're all in love with you.
- Really?

231
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,576
Yeah, but there seems to be a lot
of speculation

232
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,000
about which team you'll sign with.

233
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:13,560
Really?

234
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,520
- What the...
- Earthquake! Earthquake!

235
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,000
Quick, Pops, the kitchen

236
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:21,400
is the most dangerous place
in an earthquake!

237
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,560
- Everybody, run for your life!
- Spritle, calm down!

238
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:39,960
- Mr. Racer, morning.
- What?

239
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:44,280
(I'm... May I?)

240
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:53,080
Mr. and Mrs. Racer, I hope
you will forgive this imposition.

241
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:56,080
These are bluebells from Eden, Inc.

242
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,800
I'm told they'll bloom
at least three times

243
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,680
each time a different color.

244
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,680
And Mr. Racer, these are for you.

245
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,560
Straight from the Isle of Kamut,
hand-rolled, premium blend.

246
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:09,360
Thanks, but who are you?

247
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:12,720
I am E.P. Arnold Royalton, Esquire

248
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:15,040
President and Chairman
of Royalton Industries.

249
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,480
And it is my honor to meet you both.

250
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,960
Oh, dear, I seem to have interrupted
your breakfast.

251
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,640
Is that pancakes I smell?

252
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:28,200
Oh, are you hungry, Mr. Royalton?

253
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:31,480
A figure like mine requires
constant attention, Mrs. Racer.

254
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:33,240
And do you like pancakes?

255
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:38,240
When I was a child, we used to say,
<i>"Pfannkuchen sind Liebchen!"</i>

256
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:42,720
Pancakes are love.

257
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,400
Gorgeous, Mrs. Racer.

258
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,920
Superb density.

259
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,680
Hints of vanilla. Cinnamon?

260
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:00,720
- That's right.
- Absolutely gorgeous.

261
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,360
Well, I'm glad you like them.

262
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,840
Like them? I want to buy your recipe.

263
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:07,920
No. I'll give you the recipe,
Mr. Royalton.

264
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,040
Nonsense!

265
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:12,200
Cenestro Foods, a subdivision
of Royalton Industries is planning

266
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:14,200
a new range
of homecooked meals for travelers

267
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:16,600
and this is just the kind
of magic we're looking for.

268
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,920
I'll have my attorney draw up
the paperwork.

269
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:24,920
Now, then, we all know the reason
I'm here is because of you, Speed.

270
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:28,960
I was watching last night
and I have to tell you, young man

271
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:31,560
you gave me goosebumps.

272
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,440
I knew at once this was
no mere driver I was watching.

273
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,160
This was an artist.

274
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:42,000
I imagine the phone's been ringing
off the hook.

275
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:44,680
Yeah. But Speed doesn't want
to drive for you

276
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,320
or any other sponsors.

277
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:50,000
- Is this your manager, then?
- That's our youngest, Spritle.

278
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,680
Nice to meet you, youngster.

279
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:57,400
- We got our eye on you, mister.
- Excellent.

280
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:01,360
The first thing I want
to make perfectly clear is that

281
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,840
I have no intention whatsoever

282
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:05,240
of trying to get Speed away
from Racer Motors.

283
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:06,840
What you have here

284
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:09,280
is what teams spend years
and millions of dollars

285
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,240
trying to achieve, chemistry.

286
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:13,280
I wouldn't dare touch a thing.

287
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:17,680
Well, excuse me for asking,
but what do you want?

288
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,480
To help.

289
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:24,160
I want to make sure you have access
to whatever resources you need

290
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,520
to continue doing
exactly what you're doing.

291
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:29,360
No offense, Royalton,
but Racer Motors has always run

292
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,440
as an independent.

293
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,000
None taken, I completely understand,
I sympathize.

294
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:35,520
No, strike that. I empathize.

295
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:39,120
You may think of R.I.
as a huge corporate conglomerate

296
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,080
but I will have you know, sir,
I still remember working all night

297
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:45,760
on a Commodore 64 in the basement
of my foster parents' home.

298
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:48,720
I built R.I.
from below the ground up.

299
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:52,160
So, while Royalton Industries may
look like a major sponsor to you

300
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:55,560
it remains in my heart
as independent to me

301
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:58,240
as the first day I quit my job
at GloBoCom

302
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,960
to start working for myself.

303
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:02,880
Now, then...

304
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:08,600
I've had this wonderful opportunity
to meet your family.

305
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:13,320
All I'm asking for is the chance
to introduce you to mine.

306
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,800
I've never flown
so low through the city.

307
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,240
Special permit.

308
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,600
Only six of them are granted a year.

309
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:34,680
Take whatever you like.

310
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,040
Thank you.

311
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,600
- Spritle!
- What?

312
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,360
She said we could have some.

313
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,640
All right, maybe one apiece.

314
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,800
Hey, look,
that's the Grand Prix Colosseum.

315
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:51,920
My brother's gonna win
the Grand Prix someday.

316
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,840
No doubt in my mind, young man.

317
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:57,880
Given the right circumstances,
no doubt in my mind whatsoever.

318
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:22,000
This is Gennie, our talent manager.

319
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:25,480
Ask for anything.
Her job is to make it come true.

320
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:28,120
Hello, Speed. Welcome to Royalton.

321
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:32,960
What's this?

322
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,800
To make an informed decision,
you'll have to understand

323
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,520
how we take care of our drivers.

324
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,720
- All aboard.
- Oh, cool!

325
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:54,200
Royalton Tower is the crown jewel
among the properties that I control.

326
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:56,400
It functions
as the corporate headquarters

327
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,800
for the top 12 divisions
of our parent corp.

328
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:01,960
One big industrious family.

329
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:08,120
Our vertically integrated plant
is the fastest in the world

330
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,720
from initial carbon bond
to finished car in 36 hours.

331
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,640
How long does it take
at Racer Motors?

332
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,000
Several weeks, at least.

333
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,920
This kind of production facility

334
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
could be at your disposal, Mr. Racer.

335
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,400
This is our operating theater

336
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:31,000
where our patented
Refusion Distributor is installed

337
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:32,240
in the turbine drive.

338
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,400
Is that
an Inner Positive Transponder?

339
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:37,160
We control the only
transponder foundry in the world

340
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:40,040
outside of Musha Motors.

341
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,320
Sorry, trade secret.

342
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:48,800
As you know, a T-180 driver's got
to be in peak physical condition.

343
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:53,040
No expense is spared to ensure
that when our drivers suit up

344
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:56,880
they are as perfectly tuned
as the machines they are controlling.

345
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,760
The best drivers
must be able to withstand

346
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:02,360
over four G's of force
in a typical race.

347
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:06,600
The will to win is nothing
without the will to prepare.

348
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,520
And at Team Royalton

349
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:13,280
we prepare our drivers
for any eventuality

350
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:17,080
and every possible condition.

351
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:18,320
I'm good!

352
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:27,080
I hope I didn't scare you, Speed,
with how hard we push our team.

353
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:30,000
I just wanted you to see
how committed we are to winning.

354
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:33,160
- I get that.
- Good.

355
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:37,960
Because I also want you to understand
that R.I. isn't all work and no play.

356
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,600
That's Cannonball Taylor!

357
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,280
Stop the car. Jack!

358
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:00,800
Jack. Come here.

359
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:05,240
Someone I'd like you to meet.
Speed Racer.

360
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,400
Allow me to introduce,
two time Grand Prix winner

361
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:13,360
five time WRL Champion
and future Hall of Famer

362
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,280
Jack Cannonball Taylor.

363
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:19,680
- Honor to meet you.
- Caught that Thunderhead replay.

364
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:21,880
Nice piece of work.

365
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:24,920
Thanks.

366
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,360
There was a rumor
you might be visiting.

367
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:30,880
It's pretty impressive.

368
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:35,240
Only thing I cared about
was that wall over there.

369
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:36,880
That's what sold me.

370
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:39,920
You want to win in this League,
you're talking to the right guy.

371
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,080
Thanks, Jack.

372
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,520
Sweet!

373
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:01,000
We treat our thoroughbreds
the way they deserve to be treated.

374
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:03,840
Sweet!

375
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:06,440
There's a full maid service,
of course, with personal chef

376
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:08,480
and masseurs available 24-7.

377
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:12,560
Sweet!

378
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:15,640
Thank you.

379
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,560
Should be perfect.

380
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:22,080
Try it on.

381
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,240
Okay.

382
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:34,880
So, Mrs. Racer, what do you think
about my family?

383
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,480
Impressed?

384
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,440
- You could say that.
- Good.

385
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,776
Because I want you to understand
the possibilities

386
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,480
that exist for your son right now.

387
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,320
What's wrong, Mr. Racer?

388
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:47,960
To be honest, Royalton

389
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,680
I'm feeling more intimidated
than impressed.

390
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:53,000
This kind of company scares me.

391
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:55,960
People like you
have way too much money.

392
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,720
When someone gets that kind of money

393
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:00,360
they start thinking that
the rules everybody else plays by

394
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:02,200
don't mean squat to them.

395
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:06,600
However, my sons
are the most important thing

396
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:09,400
I've ever done in my life
besides marrying my best friend.

397
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:14,800
And if Speed wants us to figure out
some kind of an alliance...

398
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:19,920
then you can bet your ass
we'll be in business.

399
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:27,360
- Hubba hubba.
- Oh, honey, you look so handsome.

400
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,800
- Yeah?
- Very sharp, Speed.

401
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,320
Suits you perfectly.

402
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:34,160
Regardless of what happens,
I want you to have it, it's a gift.

403
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,880
Thanks, Mr. Royalton.

404
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:41,400
So, how are you feeling, Speed?

405
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,200
It's very...

406
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,040
impressive.

407
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,400
You think that
maybe there's something

408
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:48,840
that could work out here?

409
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:55,640
I guess I'd like to think about it...

410
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:57,800
if I could.

411
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:01,240
This isn't the kind of offer
I go around making every day, son.

412
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:04,160
No, I understand that, sir.

413
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:08,880
So, if I had to give you
an answer now, then

414
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,360
- to be honest...
- Stop right there.

415
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:13,600
You're right.
You should think about it.

416
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:17,200
I'm sure you're feeling
a bit overwhelmed.

417
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,800
You should take a little time.

418
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:21,880
Think about what you saw
and heard here

419
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,800
and we'll get together
early next week.

420
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:28,000
- Deal?
- Deal.

421
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:34,720
I thought we had a deal.

422
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,040
I thought we were friends.

423
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:45,960
Well, maybe where you come from,
that's how you treat your friends.

424
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:47,600
But around here

425
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:51,000
we don't take too kindly to it,
do we, fellas?

426
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:57,000
- It hurts our feelings.
- Problem is I like you, Taejo.

427
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:04,320
And I've got a real soft spot
in my heart for that sister of yours.

428
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:10,560
And normally

429
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:13,760
under circumstances such as this

430
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:20,080
we'd be pouring you a nice
comfortable pair of concrete shoes.

431
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:24,840
But I think I thought
of another solution.

432
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:29,560
How are my babies?

433
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:32,280
Hungry?

434
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,280
Ready for seconds?

435
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,520
Boys!

436
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:49,840
No!

437
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:52,240
Don't worry, it only hurts
for a few seconds

438
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:53,600
then you'll probably black out.

439
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,160
No, please!

440
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,000
It's gonna be hard to drive
with skellie hands.

441
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:02,080
No, please!

442
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,200
You even think about turning rat

443
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:07,000
and next time
it's your sister going in there!

444
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,640
- What?
- Someone's tailing us.

445
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,840
- Is it him?
- It could be.

446
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:32,720
- Oh, God!
- It's him!

447
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:44,840
Crush him!

448
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:05,800
He's out front.

449
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:14,800
Gotcha!

450
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:18,360
Damn!

451
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,600
- Boss!
- My babies!

452
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,080
My babies!

453
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:06,920
Put your finger in there!

454
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:09,760
Do it!

455
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:16,520
Nice fishes, nice fishes.

456
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:18,080
No...

457
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:22,160
<i>- We can't take another hit, boss!</i>
- Pull over.

458
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,080
But don't stop.

459
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:49,280
- Are you hurt?
- No.

460
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:51,760
Then get up.

461
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:57,600
Thank you. You saved my life.

462
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:02,400
I didn't save anything worth saving
unless you get smart real fast.

463
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:04,440
You thought you could take
on the Cartel.

464
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,360
You can't. Not without help.

465
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,360
I don't know
what you're talking about.

466
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:13,920
You have been
on Cruncher Block's leash for so long

467
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:17,240
maybe you forgot how it feels
to stand up and be a man.

468
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:20,960
The only way you'll ever stop
these people

469
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,560
is to bring them to justice.

470
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Justice?

471
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:27,760
That's a commodity
I don't waste my money on.

472
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:33,400
Get out.

473
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:43,000
- I'll see you at Fuji.
- You won't finish.

474
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,440
When you lose

475
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:48,120
if you can still dial a phone,
call this number.

476
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:51,600
You're really considering signing
with Royalton.

477
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:54,520
- I just said it was tempting.
- Why?

478
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:59,840
Well, they got a really good team.
Cannonball Taylor, Maggie Manifold.

479
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,360
They win a lot of majors.

480
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:04,640
And since when did winning
become so important?

481
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:07,560
It is important.

482
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,936
You gotta win
if you want to keep driving

483
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:11,240
and that's what I want to do.

484
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:14,000
It's the only thing
I really know how to do.

485
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:16,960
- That's not true.
- Come on.

486
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,600
I wouldn't have made it out
of high school without your help.

487
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:21,320
Okay, well, that's true.

488
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,280
But when I'm in a T-180,
I don't know.

489
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,760
Everything just makes sense.

490
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:35,360
So, are you saying
this doesn't make sense?

491
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:39,760
Okay, this makes sense, too.

492
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:44,840
- So, you like this?
- Yeah.

493
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:46,640
This ain't so bad.

494
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,160
I was starting to wonder.

495
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:53,360
Wonder what?

496
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:57,680
Well, with you so busy becoming
Mr. Super Famous Racecar Driver

497
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:01,720
I was starting to wonder
if you were still interested in this.

498
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:06,440
- You know I am.
- Do I?

499
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,240
What, like you forgot?

500
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,760
- Maybe I need a reminder.
- Ah, a reminder.

501
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:13,640
Sometimes a girl could use
a reminder.

502
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:16,280
You mean like a new igniter
for your helicopter?

503
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:20,680
Well, how about a tire burn
that spells out your name?

504
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:23,200
Warmer.

505
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:28,000
Maybe at the end of some big race,
when I pull into Victory Lane

506
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:30,480
I scoop you up and kiss you

507
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,960
with thousands
of flashbulbs going off.

508
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:38,000
Would that be so terrible,
Mr. Super Famous Racecar Driver?

509
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:40,440
I don't know.

510
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:44,080
- Maybe we should practice.
- Maybe we should.

511
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:49,920
- Oh, God, I'm gonna hurl.
- Spritle.

512
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:51,480
He did not.

513
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,760
- Spritle.
- You little sneak.

514
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:03,480
- Wasn't my idea.
- Oh, no?

515
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:06,360
- It was his.
- Wait till we tell Pops.

516
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:09,120
Naw, don't do that.
We couldn't sleep.

517
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,520
We just wanted to hang out.

518
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:13,360
We didn't know you were going
to In-spew-ation Point.

519
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:15,640
By the way, cootie shot.

520
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:19,200
- I'm taking you home.
- Wait. Wait.

521
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:21,600
Can we stop for ice cream first?

522
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:30,360
The new GRX has a supercharged
Inner-Positive Transponder

523
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:34,400
and will be capable of speeds
in excess of 800km an hour.

524
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:37,480
If such a car were
to win the Grand Prix this year

525
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:40,640
one would expect the demand
for transponders

526
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:42,320
to increase dramatically.

527
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,360
One would expect.

528
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:46,400
And if a single company
gained control

529
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:48,800
of all the transponder foundries
in the world

530
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,440
one might expect that company
to do very well for itself.

531
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:56,000
You know what I want, and I know
that for the last few years

532
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:59,160
you've been trying to buy out
your main rival, Tetsua Togokahn.

533
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:01,080
The question is, can we make a deal?

534
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:09,080
Deliver Togokahn at that price
and the transponder foundry is yours.

535
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:11,640
Done.

536
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:21,840
- Speed!
- Mr. Royalton.

537
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,720
Welcome!

538
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:25,920
Come here!

539
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:27,280
Look at this.

540
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:35,160
Yeah, that's what I thought.

541
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:38,440
We're still working on the R and R,
but it's getting there. Come, sit!

542
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:41,480
We can talk logos later.
Can I get you something to drink?

543
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:43,040
Water? Bubbly?

544
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:46,080
- A shot of rye?
- No. I'm okay.

545
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:52,800
So, I can see you've been giving
some serious thought to this thing.

546
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:57,160
- I have. Yes, sir.
- Good.

547
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,456
That means you understand
we're talking about

548
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:02,200
not just your future
but your family's future.

549
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:06,840
- My family means a lot to me.
- I know. I can tell.

550
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:10,360
That's why this is so important.
Because you can help them.

551
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:13,120
All you have to say is yes.

552
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:16,760
That's all I need to hear
and I can make so many things happen

553
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:18,200
for you and your family.

554
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:21,720
You ready for that?

555
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:24,600
You ready to say yes, Speed?

556
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:52,320
Jackpot.

557
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:56,360
Oh, boy, oh, boy.

558
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:01,360
This isn't an easy decision for me,
Mr. Royalton.

559
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:07,000
For my family, racing's everything.

560
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:11,920
I was tooling timing pins with Pops
while I was still wearing diapers.

561
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:14,880
I mean, there's nothing more perfect

562
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:16,280
than a picnic at Thunderhead.

563
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:23,360
But when my brother died,
all that went away.

564
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:27,320
I can't tell you
how painful that was.

565
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:29,200
It nearly killed all of us.

566
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:31,880
Especially Pops.

567
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:35,320
He didn't set foot in his shop
for over a year.

568
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:41,000
But one night,
when I was still pretty young

569
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:42,936
I couldn't sleep
and I went into the living room

570
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,800
and there was Pops
in his beat up robe

571
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:47,080
watching some old race recordings.

572
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:50,360
<i>What a move by Burns
coming into that last turn.</i>

573
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:52,760
<i>Stickleton didn't see
that one coming!</i>

574
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:55,320
So, I sat with him there
watching old Ben Burns

575
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:57,960
coming around the last turn
of the 43 Prix and...

576
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:00,720
all of a sudden,
Pops started screaming.

577
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:01,936
<i>race out of that last turn.</i>

578
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:02,960
Go!

579
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:05,120
<i>And then I started screaming.</i>

580
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:09,120
<i>And as Burns and Stickleton
duked it out heading for the finish</i>

581
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,720
<i>we were cheering our heads off.</i>

582
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:14,520
<i>It's gonna be tight!
It's... It's Burns! Burns win!</i>

583
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:16,360
And the second
the black and white came down

584
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:18,760
we looked at each other

585
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:22,360
and we realized
racing's in our blood.

586
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:28,520
But for Pops, it isn't just a sport.

587
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:30,840
It's way more important than that.

588
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:34,000
It's like a religion.

589
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:35,400
And in our house

590
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:39,280
the major sponsors
are kind of like the devil.

591
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:43,840
I don't mean to offend you, sir,
and I do appreciate your offer

592
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:47,200
but after all we've been through...

593
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:51,440
I don't think
this kind of deal's for me.

594
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:02,160
You poor, naive chump.

595
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:08,600
I'm gonna pretend I didn't hear
that load of sickening schmaltz

596
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:10,176
and I'm gonna give you
a bit of an education.

597
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:12,320
And at the end of it,
if you're smart, you'll thank me

598
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:13,800
and then you'll sign that contract.

599
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:34,640
Jig's up.

600
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:39,360
Holy moly.

601
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:44,120
Hey, this is Marvin,
down at the landing pad.

602
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:45,960
I think we got mice again.

603
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:49,600
<i>All right, we'll send someone over
to take care of it. Over.</i>

604
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:54,560
Look. There is the true spirit
of the golden age of racing.

605
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:58,200
Benjamin Braddack, Reginald White,
George Wheeler

606
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:01,320
Diamond Dave Tewksbury,
and Oliver Potter.

607
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:03,560
The five most powerful men
in the world

608
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:05,000
at the turn of the last century.

609
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:06,640
For all intents and purposes

610
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:08,800
they created the modern
automotive industry.

611
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:10,840
But the true stroke of their genius

612
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:12,800
was the invention of the WRL

613
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:14,680
the world's first racing league.

614
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:27,000
Interesting that you and your father
were so moved by the 43 Prix.

615
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:29,800
One of the great finishes
in the history of racing, right?

616
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:32,880
Everyone remembers Burns
and Stickleton slugging it out

617
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:35,960
but who remembers Carl Potts?

618
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:40,800
Driving this rebuilt Wittigan
for lodyne Industries

619
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:44,240
Potts spun out in the second lap
and went down as a DNF

620
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:46,320
a forgettable and pathetic finish.

621
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:50,600
So bad that, afterwards,
Iodyne stock dropped six points.

622
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:55,600
But, as Ben Burns sat guzzling cold,
fresh milk in Victory Lane

623
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:57,480
a thousand cameras taking his picture

624
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,520
Sirrus Aeronautics
saw almost a 12-point gain

625
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:02,600
which immediately blocked
Penninsula Power Cell

626
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:05,200
from being able to afford the price
of a complete takeover.

627
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:07,960
This put Joel Goldman,
the CEO of lodyne, Inc.

628
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:09,920
In the exact position
he wanted to be in.

629
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,200
By first buying controlling interest
in his own company

630
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:14,640
at a devalued price,
he then brokered a merger

631
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:16,760
with Sirrus
that immediately sent lodyne

632
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:20,000
into the gains record book,
the only record book that matters.

633
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:22,280
Look out that window.

634
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:25,160
There isn't a single plane
or helicopter or K-Harrier

635
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:27,840
that isn't powered
by lodyne fuel cells.

636
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:29,360
That's what racing is about.

637
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:31,800
It has nothing to do with cars
or drivers.

638
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:36,080
All that matters is power
and the unassailable might of money.

639
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:39,120
Dude! Yeah!

640
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:49,640
Out of the way! Out of the way!
Get out of the way!

641
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:00,760
You understand?

642
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:06,360
Burns knew he was going to win.
It was already decided.

643
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:10,120
A week before the Prix,
Goldman and Sirrus met

644
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:12,720
with several other major players
at the Cargyle Hotel.

645
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:14,480
They met there as they had for years.

646
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:18,000
They met to negotiate
the finish order of the Grand Prix.

647
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:22,320
No race is more important
and no race is more controlled.

648
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:24,520
That year, Goldman
was supposed to win

649
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:26,136
but he knew that
if he sold his win to Sirrus

650
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:27,880
whatever that win
might be worth was nothing

651
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:29,560
compared to what could be gained.

652
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:33,880
That's why I spent $3 million
on this burnt

653
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:35,560
and twisted lump of metal.

654
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:37,680
Because it reminds me
of what really matters.

655
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:41,800
This is the true heart of racing,
boy.

656
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:44,880
This is my religion.

657
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:51,440
You don't know how many times
I've seen that same cow eyed

658
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:53,560
say-it-isn't-so look of disbelief.

659
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:55,600
Every bumpkin
who comes in from the sticks

660
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:57,240
looks exactly as you do now.

661
00:45:57,320 --> 00:45:58,720
I won't bother proving it to you.

662
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:01,080
You walk away from me,
you walk away from this deal

663
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:02,800
you'll know
how true it is soon enough.

664
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:03,920
So, last chance.

665
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:06,600
You ready to put away your toys
and grow up?

666
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:08,480
Are you ready to make more money
in one year

667
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:10,120
than your father made
in his whole life?

668
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:12,480
Are you ready to become
a real racecar driver?

669
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:14,240
Then sign that contract!

670
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:31,160
Spearhook.

671
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:47,280
What's this?

672
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:50,520
If that's your idea of racing,
you can keep it.

673
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:57,720
Listen to me and listen good, kid

674
00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:00,040
because I'm gonna give you
one more history lesson.

675
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:02,296
You're gonna go to Fuji
and you're gonna try and prove

676
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:04,400
that everything I just told you
is nothing but a lie.

677
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:07,320
But no matter how well you drive,
you won't win, you won't place.

678
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:10,280
I guarantee you right now,
you won't even finish the race.

679
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:21,280
Speed Racer's making his move,
gunning for the lead.

680
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:53,800
The Harbinger of Boom
once again leaves his mark

681
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:56,320
a trail of carnage and chaos
cartwheeling behind him!

682
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:58,120
Oh, but the fans love it, don't they?

683
00:47:58,200 --> 00:47:59,560
They do, God help them.

684
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:00,936
And they're about to get some more

685
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:03,960
<i>as lodyne is now slugging it out
with young Taejo Togokahn.</i>

686
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:36,360
<i>Oh, terrible crash!</i>

687
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:38,856
<i>They're gonna have to fish Taejo
and Billy Ray out of the drink.</i>

688
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:40,240
<i>This race is far from over.</i>

689
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:43,560
<i>And right now, one car stands
between Speed Racer and the lead.</i>

690
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:45,320
<i>The Gray Ghost.</i>

691
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:47,240
We got ourselves a real race here!

692
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:54,200
Show me what you got.
Show me what you got!

693
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:13,640
- Speed, get out of there!
- I can't, I can't move!

694
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:33,920
Soon after that

695
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,760
there'll be litigation against some
of your father's designs.

696
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:40,560
Are you Pops Racer of Racer Motors?

697
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:42,080
Yeah. But I'm still on vacation.

698
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:43,760
You are hereby served a summons.

699
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:44,840
What?

700
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:47,200
You are being sued
for IP infringement

701
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:48,840
by Janus Automakers.

702
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:51,000
- No way!
- That's ridiculous.

703
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:53,080
That's for a jury to decide.

704
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
The legitimacy of the lawsuits
won't matter.

705
00:49:57,080 --> 00:49:58,960
They'll be enough
to discredit his company.

706
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:01,480
Whatever contracts he has,
he'll lose.

707
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:03,520
Within a year,
he'll be filing for bankruptcy.

708
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:05,920
After that, you and the rest
of your pathetic family

709
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,240
will be history.

710
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:09,560
Pops is right.

711
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:11,840
You are the devil.

712
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:15,520
- Mr. Royalton.
- What?

713
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:17,560
- Speed!
- Spritle?

714
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:19,800
I found these two sneaking around
the restricted area.

715
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:23,160
Get this Racer trash out
of my building.

716
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:25,840
- I'll see you in Fuji.
- Yes.

717
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:27,960
And then you'll find out
you just made

718
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:30,360
the biggest mistake of your life!

719
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:40,080
Hey, kid.

720
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:45,960
- Ben Burns?
- Nice race.

721
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:49,320
I ain't seen moves like that
in a long time.

722
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:52,680
It didn't matter, I still lost.

723
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:55,560
Yeah. Tough break.

724
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:02,560
Well, good luck.

725
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:08,360
Mr. Burns, can I ask you something?

726
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:10,760
Sure, kid.

727
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:14,440
The 43 Prix.

728
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:17,840
Did you know you were gonna win?

729
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:23,280
You know, everybody thought that me
and Stickleton hated each other.

730
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:26,280
Funny, ain't it?

731
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:36,960
"Controversy surrounds Racer Motors,
now embroiled in IP litigation.

732
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:39,360
And while evidence
remains inconclusive

733
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:41,560
whether or not Speed
used an illegal device

734
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:45,760
the Fuji Helexicon seems destined
to become another mark of shame

735
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:48,440
added to the notorious
Racer family legacy

736
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:51,776
a legacy that has forever tainted
the integrity of this beloved sport."

737
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:52,800
Sparky.

738
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:55,320
Sorry, ma'am.

739
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:58,520
I'm gonna send that guy
some Chim Chim cookies.

740
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:02,000
- You'll do no such thing.
- We gotta do something, Pops.

741
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:04,400
This is exactly
what he said would happen

742
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:05,800
if I didn't drive for him.

743
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:09,040
He's just trying to scare you, son.
They tried the same thing with Rex.

744
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:11,136
If it's a fight they want,
it's a fight they'll get.

745
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:13,280
How? What can we do?

746
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:16,520
- How can we fight this?
- The truth will come out.

747
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:20,720
The truth? Don't be naive, Pops.

748
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:38,320
Speed?

749
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:40,800
Are you all right?

750
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:43,600
I don't know.

751
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:51,520
It's gonna be okay.
We'll work this out.

752
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:56,760
I don't know, Mom.
I may have really messed things up.

753
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:57,920
How?

754
00:52:59,360 --> 00:53:00,920
By not joining Royalton.

755
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:02,440
Oh, don't be silly.

756
00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:04,920
You never would have been happy
racing for that terrible man.

757
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:08,080
Maybe that's not the point.

758
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:11,720
Maybe Royalton's right
and racing's all about business

759
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:13,256
and anyone
who doesn't understand that

760
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:14,280
is just a chump.

761
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:16,160
Now you listen to me, young man.

762
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:18,480
What you do behind the wheel
of a racecar

763
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:20,720
has nothing to do with business.

764
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:22,600
Before you could even talk

765
00:53:22,680 --> 00:53:24,880
you were making noises
that sounded like an engine.

766
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:26,696
We'd try to take you to the park

767
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:28,400
and you never wanted to get out
of the car.

768
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:30,440
I loved that old wagon.

769
00:53:30,520 --> 00:53:32,760
And you remember when Rex
took you out to Thunderhead

770
00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:34,840
and let you drive?

771
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:36,520
And I turned it over.

772
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:39,120
Oh, my heart starts pounding
just thinking about it.

773
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:42,120
Mom!

774
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:45,480
Yeah, you should've seen it! Yeah!

775
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:48,480
Rex told me
the only reason we survived

776
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:50,560
was because I was wearing red socks.

777
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:52,496
And I thought your father
would have a heart attack

778
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:54,600
when you came in
with that crazy smile.

779
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:59,960
Speed, when I watch you do
some of the things you do

780
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:05,160
I feel like I'm watching someone
paint or... or make music.

781
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:08,160
I go to the races
to watch you make art.

782
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:14,440
And it's beautiful and inspiring
and everything that art should be

783
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:20,560
even though there are times
when I have to close my eyes.

784
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:24,120
But then there are other times...

785
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:27,360
when you just take my breath away.

786
00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:33,520
That is at those moments,
when I feel your father's chest swell

787
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:36,200
and I know that he's smiling
because he's pretending

788
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:38,400
that he doesn't have tears
in his eyes

789
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:40,720
that I just go to pieces.

790
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:43,760
Why?

791
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:49,200
Because I am so impossibly proud
to be your mom.

792
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:54,040
It's gonna be okay, honey.
You'll see.

793
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:56,720
We'll work this out.
We just have to stick together.

794
00:54:57,440 --> 00:54:59,880
And something good will happen.
You'll see.

795
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:14,760
Racer Hex! The Harbinger of Boom!

796
00:55:14,840 --> 00:55:16,760
Run for your lives!

797
00:55:19,840 --> 00:55:22,040
What are you two squawking about?

798
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:25,280
Pops, whatever you do,
don't open that door.

799
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:28,680
This is a bad idea.

800
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:30,840
If it was any other driver,
you'd be here.

801
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:34,360
Inspector Detector.

802
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:37,840
Good morning, Mr. Racer.
I know it's been a long time.

803
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:39,600
Ten years.

804
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:42,480
We've been after Royalton for years

805
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:44,440
for dozens
of capital corporate crimes

806
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:46,000
including WRL fixing

807
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:47,840
but we haven't had
the evidence we needed

808
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:49,760
to convict him until now.

809
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:52,280
What's he doing here?

810
00:55:52,520 --> 00:55:55,480
Racer X works closely with our WRL
corporate crimes division

811
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:57,640
helping us recruit drivers like you,
Speed.

812
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:01,120
Why does he always wear that mask?

813
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:03,200
If any of you actually knew
his identity

814
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:04,720
you'd become targets for his enemies

815
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:06,720
which include some
of the most vicious fixers

816
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:07,800
in the world.

817
00:56:10,360 --> 00:56:11,520
What do you want with me?

818
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:13,720
Are you familiar
with the driver Taejo Togokahn?

819
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:16,680
- Of course.
- For years, he's been contracted

820
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:18,440
by a fixer named Cruncher Block.

821
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:21,840
Recently, Taejo has been forced
to lose races

822
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:22,960
and he began resisting

823
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:24,600
thinking that he could do it
on his own.

824
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:28,720
After Fuji,
he realized he needed help.

825
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:30,080
Why help him?

826
00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:32,400
Because he has a file
with enough information

827
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:33,800
to connect Block to Royalton

828
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:35,480
which could put both of them
behind bars

829
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:36,880
for the rest of their lives.

830
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:39,280
The problem is,
he won't give us the file

831
00:56:39,360 --> 00:56:42,080
unless we help him stop
the takeover of his family's company.

832
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:44,360
How?

833
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:48,320
There's an upcoming race

834
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:51,240
that Taejo believes if he can win,
it'll catapult Togokahn Motors

835
00:56:51,320 --> 00:56:53,560
back into the spotlight
and double the cost of the buyout

836
00:56:53,640 --> 00:56:54,640
which should kill it.

837
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,440
But there aren't any more races left
except for the Grand Prix

838
00:56:57,480 --> 00:56:58,880
and we both failed to qualify.

839
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:02,120
There aren't any more track races.

840
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:07,280
- This is a cross country rally.
- Casa Cristo.

841
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:08,920
What?

842
00:57:09,640 --> 00:57:11,360
I know it seems cruel of me to ask.

843
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:14,496
But Taejo made it clear that he had
to have Speed and X on his team

844
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:15,560
or there would be no deal.

845
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:16,920
Absolutely not!

846
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,240
You'll have the support
of the entire CIB.

847
00:57:19,320 --> 00:57:21,840
No. Rally racing
is a back alley sport

848
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:23,840
filled with jackals,
headhunters, and thugs.

849
00:57:24,320 --> 00:57:25,320
I'm sorry, Inspector

850
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:27,320
but I've already lost one son
to that deathtrap.

851
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:28,480
I won't lose another.

852
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:30,240
I understand.

853
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:34,680
- If you change your mind...
- Keep your card, Chief Inspector.

854
00:57:35,240 --> 00:57:36,320
Thank you for your time.

855
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:46,200
But Pops will never let you go.

856
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:49,440
He won't if I ask him.

857
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:52,520
Speed Racer, what are you thinking?

858
00:57:52,840 --> 00:57:54,920
You weren't in Royalton's office,
Trix.

859
00:57:55,240 --> 00:57:56,560
You don't know what it was like.

860
00:57:57,600 --> 00:57:59,920
Felt as though he had his hand
inside my chest

861
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,920
and he was trying to crush everything
in my life that mattered to me.

862
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:10,400
All right. Let's do it.
You're gonna need an alibi.

863
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:13,720
- We'll say we're going skiing.
- What? No way.

864
00:58:13,880 --> 00:58:15,120
You're gonna need my help.

865
00:58:15,360 --> 00:58:18,160
Casa Cristo is a rally.
I can spot from a 'copter.

866
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:21,400
Trixie, this isn't a game.
These people play rough.

867
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:24,800
I know.
That's why I'm going with you.

868
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:27,040
And if you even try to argue with me

869
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:29,320
I'll tell Pops and he'll never
let you out of his sight.

870
00:58:30,080 --> 00:58:31,720
You would, wouldn't you?

871
00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:35,440
Well...

872
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:38,320
I guess we're going skiing.

873
00:58:40,560 --> 00:58:42,120
<i>We're just minutes away
from the start</i>

874
00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:44,720
<i>of the 82nd annual
Casa Cristo Classic</i>

875
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:46,160
<i>the grande dame of cross country</i>

876
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:48,080
<i>the second oldest rally race
in the world</i>

877
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:50,720
<i>spanning two continents,
three climate changes</i>

878
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:54,880
<i>and 5,000km of the most winding
and treacherous roads ever raced.</i>

879
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:57,320
<i>With me again is five-time
Casa Cristo champion</i>

880
00:58:57,400 --> 00:58:59,400
- Spritle!
<i>- Johnny "Goodboy" Jones.</i>

881
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:03,120
What are you two doing?

882
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:07,600
Just watching a little TV, Pops.
It's his favorite show.

883
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:13,840
- It's in German.
- Not the monkey parts.

884
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:17,000
Oh, no, you don't.
You are not watching that race.

885
00:59:17,080 --> 00:59:19,880
Out you go. Outside!
Get some exercise.

886
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:21,360
You're too pale!

887
00:59:22,560 --> 00:59:25,720
Speed. I want you to understand

888
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:28,320
how much the CIB appreciates
your help on this.

889
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:30,560
I'm not doing this to help the CIB.

890
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,720
I don't know anything
about corporate crimes

891
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:34,760
and honestly, if I did,
it wouldn't really matter.

892
00:59:35,160 --> 00:59:37,560
I'm doing this because
someone's trying to hurt my family

893
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:39,840
and I'm gonna do everything I can
to hurt him back.

894
00:59:41,840 --> 00:59:44,360
Safety has been a primary concern
for Casa Cristo officials

895
00:59:44,440 --> 00:59:45,880
especially the last few years.

896
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:47,416
That's right, Colton.
There were a number

897
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:48,720
of fatalities several years ago.

898
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:50,280
It really had a bad reputation.

899
00:59:50,840 --> 00:59:53,040
Fans started calling it,
"The Crucible."

900
00:59:53,120 --> 00:59:55,560
These are some of the most dangerous
drivers in the world.

901
00:59:55,640 --> 00:59:57,960
And we expect they'll do anything
they can to stop you.

902
00:59:58,520 --> 01:00:01,080
Their cars will probably be equipped
with secret weapons

903
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:04,080
so we've modified the Mach Five
to try to counter their attacks.

904
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:07,240
The "A" button will operate
your normal jump jacks.

905
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:08,960
"B" will seal your cockpit

906
01:00:09,120 --> 01:00:11,200
which we fortified
with bulletproof polymer.

907
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:14,880
Should someone go after your tires
with, say, a hidden shank or shredder

908
01:00:15,160 --> 01:00:17,360
the "C" button
will activate your tire shields.

909
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:19,680
However, in the event of any blowout

910
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:22,280
"D" will inflate
a Hexadyno emergency spare.

911
01:00:22,680 --> 01:00:25,240
"E" will activate
these zircon tipped saw blades.

912
01:00:25,560 --> 01:00:28,360
They'll cut through almost anything.
Use with discretion.

913
01:00:29,160 --> 01:00:31,080
"F" will project the tire crampons.

914
01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:34,200
And finally, "G" will launch
a remote control homing bird

915
01:00:34,280 --> 01:00:37,600
that is capable of transmitting
U-CAP footage anywhere you are.

916
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:40,320
Every race fan has heard
the rumors of spearhooks

917
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:42,560
tire shanks and battery boosters.

918
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:45,200
No... While it's true
there have been a few bad apples

919
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:48,000
on the whole, most teams stay
within legal rules.

920
01:00:54,320 --> 01:00:56,200
Or at least try not to get caught.

921
01:00:59,840 --> 01:01:02,160
This is wrong,
what you are trying to do.

922
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:07,800
Musha's price is an insult
to five generations of our family.

923
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:10,720
And if you die?

924
01:01:12,680 --> 01:01:14,360
Then will the price be high enough?

925
01:01:17,080 --> 01:01:18,720
- I have no choice.
- Why?

926
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:22,840
He is your father, too.

927
01:01:32,680 --> 01:01:34,680
I finally understand it now, Trix.

928
01:01:35,640 --> 01:01:36,960
I know why he left us.

929
01:01:38,680 --> 01:01:40,720
He was trying to change
this rotten business

930
01:01:40,800 --> 01:01:42,120
and they killed him for it.

931
01:01:55,560 --> 01:01:56,936
<i>I know a lot of drivers who believe</i>

932
01:01:56,960 --> 01:01:58,720
<i>that the hardest part of Cristo
is the start.</i>

933
01:01:58,800 --> 01:02:00,960
<i>- The Muqranna?
- Yeah, those archways are tricky.</i>

934
01:02:01,040 --> 01:02:02,080
<i>And speaking of starts</i>

935
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:04,080
<i>here comes the Queen
of Casa Cristo now.</i>

936
01:02:05,360 --> 01:02:08,520
<i>The moment the Queen sees the sun,
she'll signal the start.</i>

937
01:02:10,320 --> 01:02:13,240
No... This is supposed to be my race.

938
01:02:13,960 --> 01:02:16,960
I'm supposed to win!
I got the green light.

939
01:02:18,120 --> 01:02:20,600
They promised I would go
to the Grand Prix.

940
01:02:21,560 --> 01:02:24,000
For eight years,
I've played by the rules!

941
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:25,800
This is supposed to be my race!

942
01:02:25,880 --> 01:02:26,880
Enough!

943
01:02:27,560 --> 01:02:29,480
I can't stand the whining.

944
01:02:29,600 --> 01:02:32,480
Like a baby needing
its diaper changed.

945
01:02:33,360 --> 01:02:37,520
It's simple.
We have a team of wild cards.

946
01:02:37,800 --> 01:02:38,920
The problem is

947
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:42,600
these wild cards are better drivers
than you.

948
01:02:43,080 --> 01:02:45,960
What? Like hell they are!

949
01:02:46,600 --> 01:02:47,600
Prove it.

950
01:02:48,560 --> 01:02:51,280
Take out Taejo,
and the other two will quit.

951
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:54,440
You just watch me.

952
01:02:57,200 --> 01:02:58,200
Come on!

953
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:42,520
I got Racer.

954
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:13,400
<i>From where we're sitting</i>

955
01:04:13,480 --> 01:04:14,896
<i>this team Taejo Togokahn's
put together</i>

956
01:04:14,920 --> 01:04:16,120
<i>looks like they mean business.</i>

957
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:27,880
As they head out of the city
and into the Zunubian Desert

958
01:04:27,960 --> 01:04:31,200
the team leading
the pack is Snake Oiler!

959
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:33,400
Let's pinch these turds off!

960
01:04:37,480 --> 01:04:39,200
Come on! We are falling behind!

961
01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:46,440
Speed! On your right, Flying Foxes!

962
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:49,000
Got them.

963
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:08,000
Headhunters.

964
01:05:10,320 --> 01:05:11,480
They're not alone.

965
01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:04,600
- Oh, no.
- Speed Racer has a blowout!

966
01:06:17,880 --> 01:06:19,760
Move it, Speed.
It's getting ugly out there.

967
01:06:40,640 --> 01:06:43,480
Okay, no more Mr. Nice Guy.

968
01:07:04,600 --> 01:07:06,200
Hurry, Speed, they need you!

969
01:07:23,680 --> 01:07:24,720
Where have you been?

970
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:27,080
Have any of these drivers
read the rulebook?

971
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:34,960
See? This race is full of cheaters.

972
01:07:35,520 --> 01:07:37,720
It's tough to see what goes on
in those dust clouds.

973
01:07:37,800 --> 01:07:39,680
It can get really nasty in there.

974
01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:48,080
- Watch the backdraft.
- You want some?

975
01:07:48,160 --> 01:07:50,640
Come on! Thor Axine, yeah!

976
01:07:50,720 --> 01:07:51,720
Wing left.

977
01:07:55,720 --> 01:07:56,760
Flying in.

978
01:07:59,920 --> 01:08:01,560
- Lead them!
- Here you go.

979
01:08:21,760 --> 01:08:23,400
What? Watch the blind side!

980
01:08:32,160 --> 01:08:33,960
Broom Hilda!

981
01:08:37,440 --> 01:08:41,480
Crom!

982
01:08:52,200 --> 01:08:53,240
Taejo!

983
01:09:03,360 --> 01:09:04,880
Oh, my God, did I just see that?

984
01:09:04,960 --> 01:09:06,880
A rear single set jump
into a flying kick!

985
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:09,920
I know he blew up at Fuji,
but this kid is flat out magic!

986
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:25,280
I'm going into town for some parts.
I'll be back for lunch.

987
01:09:26,160 --> 01:09:27,320
Sure thing, Pops.

988
01:09:35,240 --> 01:09:36,240
Let's go!

989
01:09:39,240 --> 01:09:40,640
<i>The Togokahn team is fighting</i>

990
01:09:40,720 --> 01:09:42,256
- Game on.
<i>- Their way back into the race</i>

991
01:09:42,280 --> 01:09:45,120
<i>behind the electrifying driving
of Speed Racer.</i>

992
01:09:45,720 --> 01:09:47,376
<i>The fans are getting
their money's worth today.</i>

993
01:09:47,400 --> 01:09:50,080
Honey! I can't find my wallet.

994
01:09:50,160 --> 01:09:53,920
Spritle! You two are in big trouble!

995
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,520
Wait. Wait, before you get mad
at us, look!

996
01:09:56,880 --> 01:09:59,400
- I'm not falling for that.
- It's Speed!

997
01:09:59,480 --> 01:10:02,520
- Speed's skiing!
- Then who's driving the Mach Five?

998
01:10:02,600 --> 01:10:05,720
<i>The pace has been relentless
as the eight remaining teams slice</i>

999
01:10:05,800 --> 01:10:08,080
<i>their way through the aqueducts
of Sassicaia.</i>

1000
01:10:09,560 --> 01:10:10,560
Oh, no.

1001
01:10:10,760 --> 01:10:12,920
As we near the end of the first leg
of the Casa Cristo

1002
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:14,600
one team has dominated the race.

1003
01:10:14,680 --> 01:10:15,936
And here they come,
through the streets

1004
01:10:15,960 --> 01:10:17,320
of Cortega heading for the finish.

1005
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:24,200
Yeah!

1006
01:10:38,760 --> 01:10:41,960
If we drive tomorrow
like we drove today, we will lose!

1007
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:44,520
You will get nothing.

1008
01:10:45,720 --> 01:10:48,120
- All of this will be meaningless!
- Relax.

1009
01:10:48,480 --> 01:10:50,880
Snake's weak on turns.
We'll catch him in the mountains.

1010
01:10:51,160 --> 01:10:53,080
We might, if you stop showing off.

1011
01:10:54,200 --> 01:10:56,280
Hey, all I was doing
was saving your ass.

1012
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:00,240
Don't fall apart yet.

1013
01:11:01,360 --> 01:11:03,000
There's still a lot of race to run.

1014
01:11:11,040 --> 01:11:13,280
A CIB man will be posted
outside your door.

1015
01:11:14,320 --> 01:11:15,760
We got their attention today.

1016
01:11:16,240 --> 01:11:18,080
You and Trixie
should be very careful tonight.

1017
01:11:19,960 --> 01:11:20,960
Racer X.

1018
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:23,360
I thought we made a good team today.

1019
01:11:25,240 --> 01:11:27,120
Felt like we'd been doing it
for a long time.

1020
01:11:29,640 --> 01:11:30,800
If you say so.

1021
01:11:35,080 --> 01:11:36,480
<i>Ineptitude!</i>

1022
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:40,360
<i>- Is this what I pay you for?</i>
- They ain't checkered yet.

1023
01:11:40,640 --> 01:11:44,560
If they do, I assure you it'll be
a very costly mistake for everyone.

1024
01:11:46,680 --> 01:11:48,120
It was very weird, Trix.

1025
01:11:48,200 --> 01:11:50,256
I knew every move he was gonna make
and he knew mine.

1026
01:11:50,280 --> 01:11:51,520
It was so familiar.

1027
01:11:53,520 --> 01:11:55,720
Maybe I'm crazy,
but Racer X first showed up

1028
01:11:55,800 --> 01:11:57,280
two years after Rex's death.

1029
01:11:57,600 --> 01:12:01,120
- But, Speed, we buried Rex.
- A body was buried.

1030
01:12:01,720 --> 01:12:04,120
Remember, it had already been
badly burned in the crash.

1031
01:12:04,200 --> 01:12:06,560
Even if it was Rex,
no one could have recognized him.

1032
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
So, you think he faked the crash

1033
01:12:10,080 --> 01:12:12,320
with a different body
in the driver's seat?

1034
01:12:12,520 --> 01:12:14,640
Somehow, the kwik save
was disconnected.

1035
01:12:15,200 --> 01:12:17,640
Inspector Detector
suspected foul play

1036
01:12:17,720 --> 01:12:19,760
but nothing could be proved.

1037
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:26,160
Do you really think Rex
could put everyone through all that?

1038
01:12:29,520 --> 01:12:31,600
Maybe he felt
he didn't have any other choice.

1039
01:12:34,360 --> 01:12:36,720
I'm sorry to disturb you, sir,
but do you know these people?

1040
01:12:43,520 --> 01:12:44,520
Yeah.

1041
01:12:46,040 --> 01:12:47,520
Is this the kind of driver I have?

1042
01:12:48,280 --> 01:12:50,520
Someone who disobeys?
Someone who lies to me?

1043
01:12:50,600 --> 01:12:52,440
Is this the kind of son I've raised?

1044
01:12:53,200 --> 01:12:55,080
And you, Trixie.

1045
01:12:55,600 --> 01:12:57,760
You know what this race did
to this family.

1046
01:12:58,160 --> 01:13:00,480
Did either of you stop
and think about us?

1047
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:02,440
That's all I've been thinking about,
Pops.

1048
01:13:02,720 --> 01:13:04,720
You, Mom, Spritle, Sparky.

1049
01:13:05,160 --> 01:13:06,840
Yeah, you, too, Chim Chim.

1050
01:13:07,640 --> 01:13:10,280
We're in serious trouble, Pops,
and it's all my fault.

1051
01:13:10,360 --> 01:13:12,960
This is not the place or the race
to do anything about that.

1052
01:13:13,040 --> 01:13:15,760
- Why not?
- Because it won't do any good!

1053
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:16,840
You don't know that.

1054
01:13:16,920 --> 01:13:19,600
You think you can drive a car
and change the world?

1055
01:13:19,680 --> 01:13:21,160
It doesn't work like that!

1056
01:13:22,600 --> 01:13:23,600
Maybe not.

1057
01:13:24,520 --> 01:13:25,816
But it's the only thing I know
how to do

1058
01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:27,120
and I gotta do something.

1059
01:13:28,360 --> 01:13:30,080
That's unacceptable. This is over.

1060
01:13:30,480 --> 01:13:31,880
Pack your things. We're going home.

1061
01:13:35,800 --> 01:13:36,800
I can't.

1062
01:13:37,880 --> 01:13:40,640
- I'm sorry, Pops.
- What?

1063
01:13:41,800 --> 01:13:44,160
- I'm staying.
- So am I.

1064
01:13:44,640 --> 01:13:45,760
No, you're not.

1065
01:13:46,520 --> 01:13:50,080
- We're going home right now!
- I'm not a child, Pops.

1066
01:13:50,720 --> 01:13:52,480
You can't tell me
how to live my life.

1067
01:13:52,960 --> 01:13:55,280
If you wanna fire me
as your driver, then fine, do it.

1068
01:13:55,960 --> 01:13:58,960
But it won't change the fact
that I am going to finish this race.

1069
01:13:59,120 --> 01:14:02,200
God, you sound like Rex!
You wanna die like him too?

1070
01:14:02,280 --> 01:14:03,280
Will that make you happy?

1071
01:14:03,360 --> 01:14:05,200
Don't take it out on me
because you feel guilty

1072
01:14:05,280 --> 01:14:07,600
- for what happened to Rex!
- Okay, you two, that's enough.

1073
01:14:08,360 --> 01:14:11,600
Pops. If they're staying,
we're staying.

1074
01:14:12,560 --> 01:14:13,800
Room service!

1075
01:14:13,880 --> 01:14:17,680
And I suggest that we all find a way
to go home together.

1076
01:14:23,200 --> 01:14:24,440
Where's the Mach Five?

1077
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:26,080
Logged with security.

1078
01:14:26,320 --> 01:14:27,800
You added something to it,
didn't you?

1079
01:14:28,080 --> 01:14:29,920
Some defensive modifications.

1080
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:31,760
Whole thing's out of balance,
isn't it?

1081
01:14:33,840 --> 01:14:35,840
It pulls left, rides a little stiff.

1082
01:14:37,280 --> 01:14:38,280
Sparky!

1083
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:46,320
I'm sorry, Mom.

1084
01:14:48,920 --> 01:14:51,880
- Your father loves you. It's just...
- I know.

1085
01:14:54,840 --> 01:14:55,960
It's gonna be okay.

1086
01:14:57,560 --> 01:14:59,240
You wouldn't lie to your mother,
would you?

1087
01:14:59,840 --> 01:15:00,840
Never again.

1088
01:17:04,440 --> 01:17:06,680
I got him, Speed!
I got him! I got him!

1089
01:17:14,120 --> 01:17:15,120
Still got him!

1090
01:17:24,600 --> 01:17:25,600
Speed!

1091
01:17:32,400 --> 01:17:33,840
Attack!

1092
01:17:38,640 --> 01:17:39,800
What's going on out there?

1093
01:18:06,080 --> 01:18:09,920
You attack my family.
You try to hurt my sons.

1094
01:18:12,960 --> 01:18:14,240
Here we go!

1095
01:18:16,160 --> 01:18:17,160
What's going...

1096
01:18:41,160 --> 01:18:42,880
Oh, my God. Was that a ninja?

1097
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:44,320
More like a non-ja.

1098
01:18:44,920 --> 01:18:47,000
Terrible what passes
for a ninja these days.

1099
01:18:48,160 --> 01:18:49,160
Cool beans.

1100
01:18:52,960 --> 01:18:55,440
Oh, I'm sorry. I was looking
for Speed Racer.

1101
01:18:56,840 --> 01:18:59,480
- Horuko. Are you all right?
- No.

1102
01:18:59,560 --> 01:19:01,080
Something terrible has happened.

1103
01:19:03,680 --> 01:19:04,880
Narcolyte benzamine.

1104
01:19:05,880 --> 01:19:07,960
A highly effective
and debilitating drug.

1105
01:19:08,280 --> 01:19:10,840
Stays in the system for hours,
but leaves with no trace.

1106
01:19:10,920 --> 01:19:14,560
- I'll be fine by morning.
- No, you won't.

1107
01:19:14,920 --> 01:19:17,000
You can't drive a car.
You can barely stand up.

1108
01:19:20,040 --> 01:19:22,000
You do not tell me what I can do.

1109
01:19:23,120 --> 01:19:24,120
Taejo.

1110
01:19:27,360 --> 01:19:28,400
What are we gonna do?

1111
01:19:33,160 --> 01:19:35,680
<i>The second leg
of the Casa Cristo is underway</i>

1112
01:19:35,760 --> 01:19:37,400
<i>and the stage is set
for what might be one</i>

1113
01:19:37,480 --> 01:19:39,440
<i>of the most ferocious rallies
we've seen in years.</i>

1114
01:19:40,560 --> 01:19:41,880
This is my race!

1115
01:19:49,160 --> 01:19:50,800
She's leaving the hotel now.

1116
01:19:53,400 --> 01:19:54,760
Wicked sidewinder coming up.

1117
01:19:54,840 --> 01:19:56,520
Watch the inside out,
could get dicey.

1118
01:19:57,960 --> 01:19:58,960
Watch your line!

1119
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:02,000
Watch it!

1120
01:20:02,200 --> 01:20:04,640
- This is abso...
- lutely crazy.

1121
01:20:06,320 --> 01:20:08,840
Yeah, boss. Signal's loud and clear.

1122
01:20:18,120 --> 01:20:21,160
Don't do it! On the ground! Now!

1123
01:20:25,280 --> 01:20:26,280
Got you.

1124
01:20:32,120 --> 01:20:33,280
What the...

1125
01:20:36,480 --> 01:20:38,560
You cheater!

1126
01:20:40,400 --> 01:20:43,120
If you're here, who's...

1127
01:20:46,480 --> 01:20:49,280
That's better.
I couldn't see a thing.

1128
01:20:51,280 --> 01:20:53,120
<i>That's it. Nice line, Trix.</i>

1129
01:20:53,440 --> 01:20:54,536
<i>Top of the hill's coming up.</i>

1130
01:20:54,560 --> 01:20:56,640
<i>I'd say Snake's got about a quarter
of a mile on you.</i>

1131
01:20:56,840 --> 01:20:58,120
All right. Let's go get him.

1132
01:20:58,200 --> 01:21:00,720
If you'd been a little more careful,
he wouldn't be ahead of us.

1133
01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:03,280
I told you I couldn't see a thing
out of this dang helmet!

1134
01:21:05,560 --> 01:21:08,400
I can't believe you talked us
into this ridiculous idea.

1135
01:21:08,720 --> 01:21:10,000
What's ridiculous about it?

1136
01:21:10,600 --> 01:21:12,136
You're the one who's always saying
I'm a better driver

1137
01:21:12,160 --> 01:21:13,520
than most of the WRL.

1138
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:15,840
- Now's not the time to prove it!
- Why not?

1139
01:21:15,960 --> 01:21:16,960
It's too dangerous!

1140
01:21:17,560 --> 01:21:19,600
It's too dangerous for me,
but not for you, right?

1141
01:21:19,680 --> 01:21:21,000
Children, focus.

1142
01:21:21,200 --> 01:21:23,136
If we're going to have a chance,
we're going to have to pass Snake

1143
01:21:23,160 --> 01:21:24,280
before the rendezvous.

1144
01:21:25,040 --> 01:21:27,440
I'm ready. Let's roll.

1145
01:21:37,080 --> 01:21:38,200
Go get them, girl!

1146
01:21:38,920 --> 01:21:41,000
Here they come. Let's pick it up!

1147
01:21:46,080 --> 01:21:48,280
- Take him.
- With pleasure.

1148
01:21:49,640 --> 01:21:50,640
Bring it on!

1149
01:21:52,520 --> 01:21:53,520
Come on!

1150
01:22:02,320 --> 01:22:04,480
Now the gloves are off
and they're pounding one another

1151
01:22:04,520 --> 01:22:06,600
bumper to bumper, rail to rail.

1152
01:22:13,600 --> 01:22:15,240
Take that, Togokahn!

1153
01:22:20,120 --> 01:22:21,360
You're going down!

1154
01:22:34,680 --> 01:22:36,760
- Oh, yeah!
- That's my boy!

1155
01:22:39,080 --> 01:22:40,840
Oh, God! Speed!

1156
01:22:41,600 --> 01:22:47,080
Please... Oh, please! Please!

1157
01:22:51,280 --> 01:22:53,080
The Togokahn Team roars into the lead

1158
01:22:53,160 --> 01:22:55,880
behind some very aggressive driving
by Speed Racer!

1159
01:22:55,960 --> 01:22:58,080
Are you kidding me?
He just tore Snake a new tailpipe!

1160
01:22:58,280 --> 01:23:01,000
- Trix, you all right?
- 10-4.

1161
01:23:01,200 --> 01:23:03,480
- Ready for more.
- Then let's move it.

1162
01:23:03,720 --> 01:23:05,000
We've got some time to eat up.

1163
01:23:08,440 --> 01:23:11,560
- You're sure, no cameras here?
- No, I checked it this morning.

1164
01:23:11,640 --> 01:23:13,600
There's quite a few dead spots
in these mountains.

1165
01:23:23,360 --> 01:23:25,880
- What's he doing here?
- Stowaway.

1166
01:23:26,360 --> 01:23:27,800
We weren't sure what to do with him.

1167
01:23:27,920 --> 01:23:31,160
Do what he'd do.
Break his legs and let him walk back.

1168
01:23:34,600 --> 01:23:35,600
Thank you so much.

1169
01:23:35,920 --> 01:23:37,000
Oh, it was a blast.

1170
01:23:37,080 --> 01:23:38,080
The cell's reloaded.

1171
01:23:38,480 --> 01:23:39,480
Let's go!

1172
01:23:39,760 --> 01:23:40,760
Good luck.

1173
01:23:45,920 --> 01:23:47,120
Nobody move!

1174
01:23:47,680 --> 01:23:49,280
We're still waiting
for the Togokahn Team

1175
01:23:49,360 --> 01:23:50,360
to come out of the pass.

1176
01:23:50,440 --> 01:23:52,800
Those roads can really ice up.
Very dangerous.

1177
01:23:52,880 --> 01:23:53,880
What is this?

1178
01:23:54,280 --> 01:23:57,480
This is called a change of plan.

1179
01:23:57,920 --> 01:23:59,440
Yeah, that's right.

1180
01:23:59,680 --> 01:24:01,320
We're changing your plan

1181
01:24:01,400 --> 01:24:05,000
that changed our plan
to change your plan.

1182
01:24:05,480 --> 01:24:06,480
Right, boss?

1183
01:24:07,040 --> 01:24:08,880
- The new plan...
- What was it?

1184
01:24:09,360 --> 01:24:11,440
Break your legs
and make you walk back?

1185
01:24:11,760 --> 01:24:12,840
I like that.

1186
01:24:13,480 --> 01:24:16,360
But first, it's time to play
a little game

1187
01:24:16,440 --> 01:24:19,720
of peekaboo I see you.

1188
01:24:28,200 --> 01:24:29,200
Monkey cookie!

1189
01:24:29,960 --> 01:24:31,080
Nice shot!

1190
01:24:31,560 --> 01:24:32,560
Spritle?

1191
01:24:34,920 --> 01:24:36,760
Get that monkey!

1192
01:25:40,040 --> 01:25:41,760
Nobody messes with Spark...

1193
01:26:10,840 --> 01:26:12,680
Looks like another change of plan.

1194
01:26:16,520 --> 01:26:18,000
Take him away, boys.

1195
01:26:20,600 --> 01:26:21,760
Spritle!

1196
01:26:27,040 --> 01:26:28,280
Go...

1197
01:26:31,040 --> 01:26:33,000
Oh, no, you don't.
You're in big trouble.

1198
01:26:33,240 --> 01:26:35,400
<i>First out of the pass is</i>...

1199
01:26:36,240 --> 01:26:37,320
the Hydra Cell Team.

1200
01:26:37,880 --> 01:26:39,440
They better send
the emergency trailer.

1201
01:26:39,920 --> 01:26:40,920
Wait, is that?

1202
01:26:42,320 --> 01:26:43,320
Here we go again.

1203
01:26:43,400 --> 01:26:44,720
Whatever happened in that pass

1204
01:26:44,800 --> 01:26:46,400
has left Togokahn
back where they started

1205
01:26:46,480 --> 01:26:48,680
but now only one obstacle stands

1206
01:26:48,760 --> 01:26:50,440
between Snake Oiler and victory.

1207
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:52,360
The Maltese Ice Caves.

1208
01:26:57,880 --> 01:26:58,960
This is where Rex...

1209
01:27:14,680 --> 01:27:16,160
Speed, what are you doing?

1210
01:27:16,240 --> 01:27:18,280
<i>- Are you all right?</i>
- I'm fine.

1211
01:27:22,800 --> 01:27:25,760
This next cave's a rattler.
We'll make our move in there.

1212
01:27:29,400 --> 01:27:30,400
Now.

1213
01:27:47,960 --> 01:27:49,480
Not this time, punk.

1214
01:28:03,160 --> 01:28:04,240
Speed!

1215
01:28:09,480 --> 01:28:11,840
Bye-bye, little turd.

1216
01:28:30,480 --> 01:28:32,360
He did not! He did not just do that!

1217
01:28:32,440 --> 01:28:34,560
Speed Racer is driving straight up
a cliff face!

1218
01:28:34,640 --> 01:28:36,680
- Are we getting this?
- (French)

1219
01:28:48,400 --> 01:28:50,600
- Come on!
- Go, Speed, go!

1220
01:28:50,680 --> 01:28:53,680
- Hi. Remember me?
- No way!

1221
01:29:05,720 --> 01:29:09,280
No... Not again! Not again!

1222
01:29:09,960 --> 01:29:12,160
- Gun!
- (Foreign language)

1223
01:29:39,280 --> 01:29:41,360
Snake Oiler completely going out
of his mind!

1224
01:29:42,280 --> 01:29:44,456
Could have been altitude sickness.
It gets crazy up there.

1225
01:29:44,480 --> 01:29:46,280
Whatever it was,
Speed handled it beautifully.

1226
01:29:46,360 --> 01:29:49,880
And with less than 250km to go,
nothing seems to stand

1227
01:29:49,960 --> 01:29:52,400
between Togokahn and victory.

1228
01:30:16,320 --> 01:30:17,800
Get me Tetsua Togokahn.

1229
01:30:27,240 --> 01:30:28,240
Thank you.

1230
01:30:32,600 --> 01:30:33,680
We make a good team.

1231
01:30:35,880 --> 01:30:39,160
We did our part.
Make sure you do yours.

1232
01:30:40,360 --> 01:30:41,360
Of course.

1233
01:30:43,880 --> 01:30:45,920
Congratulations, Mr. Togokahn.

1234
01:30:46,960 --> 01:30:49,840
- Very impressive race.
<i>- Yes, thank you.</i>

1235
01:30:49,920 --> 01:30:52,120
You're very generous, Mr. Royalton.

1236
01:30:52,840 --> 01:30:56,000
Here, Speed, does this mean
you've signed with Togokahn?

1237
01:30:56,840 --> 01:31:00,960
No, this was
a mutually beneficial opportunity.

1238
01:31:01,240 --> 01:31:03,600
- Yes. Well put.
- Taejo!

1239
01:31:03,680 --> 01:31:05,920
Will you be running
in the Grand Prix this weekend?

1240
01:31:07,040 --> 01:31:10,920
We'll see. Right now I'm just going
to enjoy this victory.

1241
01:31:17,640 --> 01:31:19,600
The price is 78 a share.

1242
01:31:20,800 --> 01:31:22,200
That's outrageous.

1243
01:31:22,840 --> 01:31:26,680
The price is barely above 50.
This is extortion, blackmail.

1244
01:31:26,760 --> 01:31:30,200
I'll sue you, tie up every asset
you own for the next 20 years.

1245
01:31:31,480 --> 01:31:34,280
<i>As you wish, Mr. Royalton,
have a nice day.</i>

1246
01:31:34,360 --> 01:31:35,360
Wait.

1247
01:31:38,320 --> 01:31:39,720
Seventy-eight a share.

1248
01:31:43,160 --> 01:31:44,680
I'll have the paperwork drawn up.

1249
01:31:45,200 --> 01:31:47,320
A pleasure doing business with you.

1250
01:31:50,560 --> 01:31:52,680
You have done very well for us,
my son.

1251
01:32:03,240 --> 01:32:04,616
I don't get it, Pops.
What just happened?

1252
01:32:04,640 --> 01:32:07,400
Togokahn's played us for chumps.
All he wanted was our help

1253
01:32:07,480 --> 01:32:09,016
to drive up the stock
in his family business.

1254
01:32:09,040 --> 01:32:10,040
Even if he had a file

1255
01:32:10,120 --> 01:32:11,760
he had no intention
of turning it over.

1256
01:32:11,840 --> 01:32:13,400
You mean the whole race
was for nothing?

1257
01:32:59,920 --> 01:33:00,920
X?

1258
01:33:02,480 --> 01:33:03,480
Racer X!

1259
01:33:04,640 --> 01:33:05,640
Racer X!

1260
01:33:13,640 --> 01:33:15,280
Jesus, kid, you can drive.

1261
01:33:16,320 --> 01:33:18,000
I haven't been thrown like that
in years.

1262
01:33:18,320 --> 01:33:19,440
What are you doing here?

1263
01:33:20,560 --> 01:33:23,600
The Inspector told me what happened.
I came looking for you.

1264
01:33:24,160 --> 01:33:25,280
Why would you care?

1265
01:33:25,520 --> 01:33:27,960
Because you're a fighter,
and a friend.

1266
01:33:29,480 --> 01:33:31,080
Why don't you just tell me the truth?

1267
01:33:32,360 --> 01:33:33,600
You're Rex, aren't you?

1268
01:33:34,560 --> 01:33:35,560
You mean your brother?

1269
01:33:35,840 --> 01:33:38,320
You first appeared
two years after Rex died.

1270
01:33:39,120 --> 01:33:40,480
You drive just like him.

1271
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:42,160
You knew I'd be here

1272
01:33:42,240 --> 01:33:44,120
because this is where
he always used to take me.

1273
01:33:45,080 --> 01:33:46,440
Just tell me the truth.

1274
01:34:02,480 --> 01:34:05,200
- You're not Rex.
- No, Speed.

1275
01:34:06,760 --> 01:34:08,880
I'm sorry, but your brother is dead.

1276
01:34:13,080 --> 01:34:14,800
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be.

1277
01:34:16,160 --> 01:34:19,160
I'm sure if he was here
he'd be immensely proud of you.

1278
01:34:19,560 --> 01:34:20,560
For what?

1279
01:34:21,560 --> 01:34:24,680
- Making the same mistakes he did?
- For trying to make a difference.

1280
01:34:25,280 --> 01:34:27,320
From what I've read,
that's all he tried to do.

1281
01:34:27,680 --> 01:34:29,040
And what good did it do?

1282
01:34:29,800 --> 01:34:31,160
He got killed for nothing.

1283
01:34:31,760 --> 01:34:33,840
Racing hasn't changed
and it never will.

1284
01:34:33,920 --> 01:34:35,960
It doesn't matter
if racing never changes.

1285
01:34:36,600 --> 01:34:39,520
What matters is
if we let racing change us.

1286
01:34:40,200 --> 01:34:42,200
Every one of us has to find a reason
to do this.

1287
01:34:42,280 --> 01:34:44,760
You don't climb into a T-180
to be a driver.

1288
01:34:45,400 --> 01:34:47,080
You do it because you're driven.

1289
01:34:48,360 --> 01:34:50,120
If you know so much,
why don't you tell me

1290
01:34:50,200 --> 01:34:51,320
why I should keep driving?

1291
01:34:51,400 --> 01:34:54,320
Sorry. That's for you to figure out.

1292
01:34:57,800 --> 01:35:01,680
I just hope when you do
that I'm there to see it.

1293
01:35:12,680 --> 01:35:14,440
- What you doing?
- What's it look like?

1294
01:35:16,280 --> 01:35:18,040
- Where you going?
- I don't know.

1295
01:35:18,120 --> 01:35:19,600
I just gotta get away from here.

1296
01:35:22,920 --> 01:35:24,360
Can I come with you, Rex?

1297
01:35:25,600 --> 01:35:26,600
What?

1298
01:35:26,680 --> 01:35:27,920
Can we come with you?

1299
01:35:30,680 --> 01:35:32,320
- No.
- Why not?

1300
01:35:40,200 --> 01:35:41,960
You'll understand
when it's your turn.

1301
01:35:45,520 --> 01:35:46,520
Speed.

1302
01:35:48,960 --> 01:35:51,000
Before you go,
I'd like to say a few things.

1303
01:35:51,680 --> 01:35:53,400
Will you sit with your old man
for a minute?

1304
01:35:54,920 --> 01:35:56,880
- Don't try and stop me.
- I won't.

1305
01:36:05,360 --> 01:36:08,200
Speed, I want you to know
I acted rashly.

1306
01:36:09,680 --> 01:36:11,160
I said things I wish I hadn't.

1307
01:36:11,560 --> 01:36:14,440
Your mother usually protects me
from making an ass out of myself

1308
01:36:14,720 --> 01:36:16,240
but I was determined to do it
this time

1309
01:36:16,320 --> 01:36:17,960
and I guess I did
a pretty good job of it.

1310
01:36:18,680 --> 01:36:21,640
I just wanted to make sure
you understood how sorry I was.

1311
01:36:22,680 --> 01:36:23,680
Thanks.

1312
01:36:24,240 --> 01:36:26,560
The truth was I couldn't have been
more proud of you, son.

1313
01:36:27,480 --> 01:36:30,080
Not because you won,
but because you stood up.

1314
01:36:30,360 --> 01:36:33,080
You weren't afraid and you did
what you thought was right.

1315
01:36:33,960 --> 01:36:37,000
It didn't amount to anything.
It was completely meaningless.

1316
01:36:37,440 --> 01:36:38,920
How could it be meaningless?

1317
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:41,880
I saw my son become a man.

1318
01:36:42,680 --> 01:36:45,800
I watched him act with courage
and integrity and drive the pants off

1319
01:36:45,880 --> 01:36:47,520
every other driver on that road.

1320
01:36:47,680 --> 01:36:49,000
This is not meaningless.

1321
01:36:49,400 --> 01:36:51,200
This is the reason
for a father's life.

1322
01:36:53,240 --> 01:36:54,640
I admit, I went to Cortega

1323
01:36:54,720 --> 01:36:56,416
because I was afraid
that what happened to Rex

1324
01:36:56,440 --> 01:36:58,600
was gonna happen to you,
and I just couldn't take that.

1325
01:36:59,480 --> 01:37:01,080
But what I realized at Cortega...

1326
01:37:02,280 --> 01:37:04,280
was I didn't lose Rex
when he crashed.

1327
01:37:04,440 --> 01:37:05,480
I lost him here.

1328
01:37:06,160 --> 01:37:08,120
I let him think that
a stupid motor company

1329
01:37:08,200 --> 01:37:09,560
meant more to me than he did.

1330
01:37:11,800 --> 01:37:14,000
He'll never know
how much I regret that mistake.

1331
01:37:15,600 --> 01:37:17,200
But it's enough
I'll never make it again.

1332
01:37:18,200 --> 01:37:22,400
Speed, I understand
that every child has to leave home

1333
01:37:23,720 --> 01:37:26,800
but I want you to know,
that door is always open.

1334
01:37:26,880 --> 01:37:28,080
You can always come back.

1335
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:31,000
'Cause I love you.

1336
01:37:34,040 --> 01:37:35,240
I love you, Pops.

1337
01:37:41,040 --> 01:37:42,720
I'm just so confused right now.

1338
01:37:44,160 --> 01:37:47,480
I feel like I'm caught
in some kind of a tailspin

1339
01:37:47,560 --> 01:37:49,120
and no direction makes sense.

1340
01:37:49,360 --> 01:37:50,960
Yeah, I know what you mean.

1341
01:37:52,160 --> 01:37:54,840
When Rex died, I didn't even know
if I wanted salt on my eggs

1342
01:37:54,920 --> 01:37:56,520
let alone keep building cars.

1343
01:37:58,080 --> 01:38:02,640
But then, you remember
that night we sat together

1344
01:38:02,720 --> 01:38:04,400
we watched old Ben Burns
and Stickleton?

1345
01:38:04,480 --> 01:38:05,480
You remember that?

1346
01:38:06,840 --> 01:38:09,040
That night, something just clicked.

1347
01:38:09,760 --> 01:38:11,920
Like a light being switched on
inside of me.

1348
01:38:13,120 --> 01:38:14,800
After that,
I never had trouble remembering

1349
01:38:14,840 --> 01:38:15,880
how I liked my eggs.

1350
01:38:17,080 --> 01:38:18,720
Jeez, Pops, that's just it.

1351
01:38:19,840 --> 01:38:21,840
- That's part of my problem.
- What?

1352
01:38:21,920 --> 01:38:24,280
That race, the 43 Prix.

1353
01:38:25,720 --> 01:38:28,400
Burns and Stickleton? It was fixed.

1354
01:38:28,880 --> 01:38:30,560
Royalton told me the whole story.

1355
01:38:31,200 --> 01:38:33,160
It was all about
some DNF named Potts.

1356
01:38:34,520 --> 01:38:35,976
They've known the winner
of every Grand Prix

1357
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:37,240
for the past 50 years.

1358
01:38:37,720 --> 01:38:38,720
It's always fixed.

1359
01:38:41,040 --> 01:38:43,400
I don't believe that.
Royalton's a crook.

1360
01:38:43,560 --> 01:38:47,080
- You can't believe a crook.
- I don't think he was lying, Pops.

1361
01:38:47,440 --> 01:38:49,840
The Grand Prix, a sham?

1362
01:38:55,080 --> 01:38:57,400
- Horuko.
- Forgive me for intruding.

1363
01:38:57,760 --> 01:38:59,720
But I had to come
before it was too late.

1364
01:39:00,640 --> 01:39:03,520
This is not a trick. I swear to you.

1365
01:39:03,760 --> 01:39:04,800
I'm not my brother.

1366
01:39:05,080 --> 01:39:06,600
Are you gonna ask the lovely lady in?

1367
01:39:08,880 --> 01:39:11,080
Yeah, sure. Come on in.

1368
01:39:13,800 --> 01:39:15,200
Can I get you something to drink?

1369
01:39:15,280 --> 01:39:18,280
No. My security man believes
I'm still at the opera

1370
01:39:18,600 --> 01:39:19,880
so I only have a moment.

1371
01:39:21,920 --> 01:39:23,560
I'm very sorry for what happened.

1372
01:39:24,120 --> 01:39:25,920
What my father and brother did
was not right

1373
01:39:26,720 --> 01:39:27,720
and I'm ashamed.

1374
01:39:28,120 --> 01:39:30,880
It's fine.
Just another lesson learned.

1375
01:39:31,160 --> 01:39:34,560
No. It is they
who are in need of a lesson.

1376
01:39:35,040 --> 01:39:36,480
This rightfully belongs to you.

1377
01:39:42,120 --> 01:39:45,240
An invitation to compete
in the 91st annual Grand Prix.

1378
01:39:45,320 --> 01:39:47,280
My brother was planning
to decline anyway.

1379
01:39:47,360 --> 01:39:49,200
But I studied the rules
very carefully.

1380
01:39:49,520 --> 01:39:51,440
And as a member
of the winning Togokahn team

1381
01:39:51,560 --> 01:39:53,920
if you present this invitation
on the day of the race

1382
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:55,400
they must allow you to compete.

1383
01:39:57,600 --> 01:39:59,880
What do you think of that,
Mr. It's Always Fixed?

1384
01:40:00,800 --> 01:40:02,600
- I...
- You don't have to say anything.

1385
01:40:02,840 --> 01:40:05,240
I only hope you drive as you did
in Casa Cristo

1386
01:40:05,480 --> 01:40:07,480
and you wipe the smiles
from their faces.

1387
01:40:08,360 --> 01:40:10,520
We don't have a car. Sparky!

1388
01:40:10,600 --> 01:40:12,640
No. No. He'll yell at me!

1389
01:40:14,920 --> 01:40:17,280
- Yo, right here, Pops.
- What are you doing in the kitchen?

1390
01:40:18,040 --> 01:40:19,080
Same as everyone else.

1391
01:40:22,720 --> 01:40:25,320
I don't believe it.
You were listening the whole time?

1392
01:40:25,400 --> 01:40:28,680
- And I'm so glad I did.
- We were so worried about you.

1393
01:40:29,440 --> 01:40:32,360
Horuko. Thank you.

1394
01:40:32,480 --> 01:40:35,040
I would say, "Good luck Saturday,"
but you don't need it.

1395
01:40:36,240 --> 01:40:38,360
You're already very lucky
to have such a family.

1396
01:40:40,360 --> 01:40:41,520
Come on, we got work to do.

1397
01:40:41,600 --> 01:40:43,400
Pops, the race
is less than two days away.

1398
01:40:43,480 --> 01:40:45,600
How fast did Royalton say
he could build that tin can

1399
01:40:45,680 --> 01:40:46,760
with his fancy machines?

1400
01:40:47,120 --> 01:40:49,160
- Thirty-six hours.
- Then we'll do it in 32.

1401
01:40:49,880 --> 01:40:50,880
Come on, let's go.

1402
01:42:07,560 --> 01:42:11,680
Ladies and gentlemen,
behold the future!

1403
01:42:16,760 --> 01:42:18,280
Sparky? You ready?

1404
01:42:20,040 --> 01:42:21,040
Ready, Pops.

1405
01:42:24,120 --> 01:42:26,960
Pops,
that's a Bernoulli Convergenator.

1406
01:42:27,040 --> 01:42:29,840
Transponder schmonder.
You want real kick, you go Bernoulli.

1407
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:35,200
Were you here last year?

1408
01:42:35,840 --> 01:42:37,280
- No.
- Yes, you were.

1409
01:42:43,400 --> 01:42:47,120
The Colosseum has begun to fill.
Final preparations are underway.

1410
01:42:47,200 --> 01:42:49,360
And we're expecting
the largest television audience

1411
01:42:49,440 --> 01:42:50,560
in Grand Prix history.

1412
01:42:50,640 --> 01:42:52,480
<i>We've got an incredible lineup
this year</i>

1413
01:42:52,560 --> 01:42:55,480
<i>like the Gray Ghost Sonic
"Boom boom" Renaldi</i>

1414
01:42:55,560 --> 01:42:58,480
<i>Nitro Venderhoss,
and The Scarlet Valentine.</i>

1415
01:42:58,560 --> 01:42:59,880
Not to mention C-ball.

1416
01:42:59,960 --> 01:43:02,400
Cannonball Taylor,
fastest Grand Prix seed in history

1417
01:43:02,480 --> 01:43:05,200
driving the new GRX
from Royalton Race Cars.

1418
01:43:19,880 --> 01:43:22,080
- Thanks, doll.
- You're welcome.

1419
01:43:22,560 --> 01:43:24,640
We've got an odd numbered field
this year

1420
01:43:24,720 --> 01:43:28,000
one shy of a full boat
as Taejo Togokahn declined

1421
01:43:28,080 --> 01:43:30,880
his automatic invitation
after winning the Casa Cristo.

1422
01:43:34,600 --> 01:43:35,960
All right, let's start her up.

1423
01:43:39,880 --> 01:43:41,320
Sounds beefy, Pops.

1424
01:43:41,400 --> 01:43:43,280
Yeah, I gave it
a little something extra.

1425
01:43:46,400 --> 01:43:48,080
Come on! Let's load it up!

1426
01:43:48,320 --> 01:43:51,280
Hold on.
Something's going on over there.

1427
01:43:52,080 --> 01:43:54,000
We're seeing some kind
of commotion down

1428
01:43:54,080 --> 01:43:55,120
at the trailer entrance.

1429
01:44:00,800 --> 01:44:01,840
Excuse me.

1430
01:44:03,760 --> 01:44:05,240
Is there a problem here, Officer?

1431
01:44:10,400 --> 01:44:12,200
Sir, we have a problem.

1432
01:44:15,280 --> 01:44:17,480
What madness is going on here?

1433
01:44:17,560 --> 01:44:19,720
Mr. Royalton,
this is a legitimate invitation.

1434
01:44:20,040 --> 01:44:21,080
We have verified it.

1435
01:44:23,480 --> 01:44:26,520
- Where did you get this?
- I won it fair and square.

1436
01:44:27,760 --> 01:44:29,840
This is preposterous.
He can't be allowed to race.

1437
01:44:29,920 --> 01:44:32,120
- It's too late.
- The ruling on this is quite clear.

1438
01:44:32,200 --> 01:44:34,360
Try to stop it
and you'll be in blatant violation

1439
01:44:34,440 --> 01:44:36,960
of the WRL charter,
leaving me no option

1440
01:44:37,040 --> 01:44:38,600
but to shut this year's Prix down

1441
01:44:38,680 --> 01:44:40,720
until a full investigation
can be completed.

1442
01:44:40,800 --> 01:44:44,400
What? Have you any idea
what that would cost?

1443
01:44:44,480 --> 01:44:46,520
- Are you insane?
- Try me.

1444
01:44:47,040 --> 01:44:50,120
Something big is going on,
because every race official has...

1445
01:44:50,520 --> 01:44:51,816
<i>- Ladies and gentlemen</i>
- Wait, wait, an announcement

1446
01:44:51,840 --> 01:44:53,480
<i>- your attention, please.</i>
- Is being made.

1447
01:44:53,960 --> 01:44:56,040
<i>Now driving in the 40th
and final position...</i>

1448
01:44:56,120 --> 01:44:57,160
Holy s♪♪t!

1449
01:44:57,240 --> 01:45:01,160
<i>for Racer Motors in the Mach Six,
Speed Racer.</i>

1450
01:45:07,200 --> 01:45:09,920
A million dollars to the driver
that takes out Racer.

1451
01:45:11,120 --> 01:45:12,720
He won't even get out of the blocks.

1452
01:45:14,520 --> 01:45:16,920
I'd prefer him to not even make it
out of the locker room.

1453
01:45:21,200 --> 01:45:24,000
We're installing a spearhook
in the GRX.

1454
01:45:24,400 --> 01:45:26,600
I don't need one to beat that punk.

1455
01:45:28,680 --> 01:45:29,680
A precaution.

1456
01:45:30,920 --> 01:45:33,760
As the cars take to the field,
you can feel

1457
01:45:33,840 --> 01:45:36,120
the anticipation mounting
in the audience.

1458
01:45:36,320 --> 01:45:40,400
Something is different.
There's an electricity in the air.

1459
01:45:40,640 --> 01:45:42,840
The presence of Speed Racer

1460
01:45:42,920 --> 01:45:45,720
has completely changed the equation.

1461
01:46:00,400 --> 01:46:01,400
How are you feeling?

1462
01:46:04,320 --> 01:46:05,320
It's big.

1463
01:46:08,360 --> 01:46:10,760
That cockpit is the exact same size
it was at Thunderhead.

1464
01:46:12,880 --> 01:46:13,880
Right.

1465
01:46:16,320 --> 01:46:17,400
I wanna say thank you

1466
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:20,376
for what could be
the most exciting moment

1467
01:46:20,400 --> 01:46:21,400
in my whole life.

1468
01:46:22,280 --> 01:46:23,760
Couldn't have gotten here
without you.

1469
01:46:30,400 --> 01:46:31,880
I'm looking forward
to that cold milk.

1470
01:46:32,640 --> 01:46:33,640
Me too.

1471
01:46:39,320 --> 01:46:43,520
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
start your engines!</i>

1472
01:46:48,880 --> 01:46:53,000
<i>The final countdown has begun
and a stillness has fallen over</i>

1473
01:46:53,080 --> 01:46:56,640
this stadium as all eyes turn
to one car.

1474
01:47:03,720 --> 01:47:04,720
<i>Ten.</i>

1475
01:47:05,760 --> 01:47:08,760
(Foreign language)

1476
01:47:08,840 --> 01:47:10,440
This ain't a race.

1477
01:47:10,880 --> 01:47:11,920
This is a showdown.

1478
01:47:31,280 --> 01:47:32,280
Trouble at the start.

1479
01:47:32,360 --> 01:47:34,840
A misfire traps Speed Racer,
causing a collision.

1480
01:47:35,280 --> 01:47:36,280
Look out.

1481
01:47:44,320 --> 01:47:45,480
That kid is wily!

1482
01:47:45,680 --> 01:47:47,480
<i>I don't know how he got out
of that one, dude!</i>

1483
01:48:19,760 --> 01:48:21,160
Nice, nice.

1484
01:48:21,440 --> 01:48:23,760
<i>Speed Racer blows by Katsu
Toppledama</i>

1485
01:48:23,840 --> 01:48:25,240
<i>charging into the Moguls.</i>

1486
01:48:25,520 --> 01:48:27,280
<i>He's taking on all comers.</i>

1487
01:48:27,360 --> 01:48:29,280
<i>Kelly Kellencoff makes a move,
cuts him off!</i>

1488
01:48:29,360 --> 01:48:32,360
<i>- A big mistake!
- Speed fakes left, jumps right.</i>

1489
01:48:32,680 --> 01:48:34,320
<i>He slips in behind Gearbox.</i>

1490
01:48:34,400 --> 01:48:35,560
Here comes over under.

1491
01:48:43,960 --> 01:48:45,240
I told you! I told you!

1492
01:48:45,320 --> 01:48:48,680
Speed Racer seems unstoppable,
moving up from dead last

1493
01:48:48,880 --> 01:48:50,080
nearing the leaders.

1494
01:48:54,520 --> 01:48:55,640
Go, Speed!

1495
01:49:37,200 --> 01:49:39,080
But look out,
as they approach the Big Drop

1496
01:49:39,160 --> 01:49:40,240
here comes Speed Racer.

1497
01:50:21,600 --> 01:50:24,880
Speed Racer is knocking on the door
of Cannonball Taylor!

1498
01:50:24,960 --> 01:50:26,560
Yoohoo, anybody home?

1499
01:50:30,600 --> 01:50:34,640
Okay, Mr. Two time Grand Prix,
Five time WRL Future Hall of Fame

1500
01:50:35,240 --> 01:50:36,600
teach me something.

1501
01:50:43,320 --> 01:50:44,320
You ready?

1502
01:50:45,360 --> 01:50:46,360
Let's go!

1503
01:50:46,880 --> 01:50:48,320
(Turkish)

1504
01:50:53,040 --> 01:50:54,320
(Turkish)

1505
01:50:55,840 --> 01:50:57,720
Get that weak shit off my track!

1506
01:51:07,760 --> 01:51:09,360
Come on, that move is weak.

1507
01:51:12,400 --> 01:51:13,760
Cannonball Taylor's in trouble!

1508
01:51:19,080 --> 01:51:20,480
Tear him up, kid, tear him up.

1509
01:51:26,880 --> 01:51:28,080
(Foreign language)

1510
01:51:33,440 --> 01:51:34,880
Come on, is that all you got?

1511
01:51:37,240 --> 01:51:39,160
- (Turkish)
- (Spanish) It's the demon on wheels.

1512
01:51:43,440 --> 01:51:46,200
Lesson's over.
See you at the finish line.

1513
01:51:48,320 --> 01:51:51,200
Do it. Stop him. Stop him now.

1514
01:51:59,160 --> 01:52:00,680
- Oh, no!
- What is it?

1515
01:52:00,760 --> 01:52:02,880
Spearhook! He's got me!

1516
01:52:04,200 --> 01:52:05,840
<i>Cannonball has Speed pinned</i>

1517
01:52:05,920 --> 01:52:07,920
<i>as they grind
through the butterfly turn.</i>

1518
01:52:08,200 --> 01:52:11,760
That cheater! He's using a spearhook!

1519
01:52:34,800 --> 01:52:35,800
(Foreign language)

1520
01:52:46,320 --> 01:52:47,320
Spearhook!

1521
01:52:47,720 --> 01:52:49,480
(Foreign language)

1522
01:52:49,560 --> 01:52:51,880
Cannonball clearly using a spearhook.

1523
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:54,600
That could cost him the Hall of Fame.

1524
01:52:54,680 --> 01:52:56,840
<i>Not to mention what it might do
to Royalton Industries.</i>

1525
01:52:56,880 --> 01:52:57,880
<i>Shame on them.</i>

1526
01:53:04,400 --> 01:53:06,800
Oh, no... don't do this!

1527
01:53:06,880 --> 01:53:08,520
The Triple Phase Conductor's fried.

1528
01:53:08,600 --> 01:53:10,280
Sparky, get me back in this race.

1529
01:53:13,760 --> 01:53:14,760
What is it? What's wrong?

1530
01:53:14,840 --> 01:53:16,680
The crash must've dislodged
the main conductor.

1531
01:53:16,760 --> 01:53:17,760
Starter's overloaded.

1532
01:53:17,840 --> 01:53:19,480
(Foreign language)

1533
01:53:19,560 --> 01:53:22,160
(Spanish) Both cars are dead.

1534
01:53:22,480 --> 01:53:23,736
The nickel hydride cells
are hemorrhaging.

1535
01:53:23,760 --> 01:53:25,096
I've got dendrite readings
everywhere.

1536
01:53:25,120 --> 01:53:26,920
- What do I do?
- Don't panic.

1537
01:53:28,480 --> 01:53:30,760
Just listen, Speed.
Just listen to her.

1538
01:53:30,880 --> 01:53:32,680
- If I could defibrillate the...
<i>- Sparky.</i>

1539
01:53:32,920 --> 01:53:33,920
Give me a second.

1540
01:53:38,560 --> 01:53:39,720
Is there anything he can do?

1541
01:53:39,800 --> 01:53:42,400
I ran a patch through the starter
to the Bernoulli Convergenator.

1542
01:53:42,520 --> 01:53:45,240
If he puts the car in fifth gear,
he could jumpstart the whole thing.

1543
01:53:45,560 --> 01:53:46,600
Will he know that?

1544
01:53:48,920 --> 01:53:49,960
Would Sparky?

1545
01:53:54,320 --> 01:53:56,120
What do you need?

1546
01:54:11,400 --> 01:54:12,600
He's back in it!

1547
01:54:18,600 --> 01:54:19,880
Come on, kid, move it!

1548
01:54:23,240 --> 01:54:24,280
He's gonna do it.

1549
01:54:25,320 --> 01:54:27,040
<i>I don't know
why I'm doing it anymore.</i>

1550
01:54:27,120 --> 01:54:29,680
You don't climb into a T-180
to be a driver.

1551
01:54:30,280 --> 01:54:31,920
You do it because you're driven.

1552
01:54:33,040 --> 01:54:35,440
Racing has nothing to do
with cars or drivers.

1553
01:54:35,520 --> 01:54:37,440
You ready to put away your toys
and grow up?

1554
01:54:37,520 --> 01:54:39,960
Are you ready to become
a real racecar driver?

1555
01:54:41,280 --> 01:54:44,240
Look at the split!
He's shattering the lap record.

1556
01:54:45,120 --> 01:54:46,120
<i>If you know so much</i>

1557
01:54:46,200 --> 01:54:48,080
<i>why don't you tell me
why I should keep driving?</i>

1558
01:54:48,160 --> 01:54:49,600
That's for you to figure out.

1559
01:54:50,160 --> 01:54:51,520
I just hope when you do

1560
01:54:52,840 --> 01:54:54,240
that I'm there to see it.

1561
01:54:59,440 --> 01:55:00,480
(Spanish) It's over!

1562
01:55:01,120 --> 01:55:03,160
When I watch you do some
of the things you do...

1563
01:55:06,800 --> 01:55:08,160
that you just take my breath away.

1564
01:55:16,280 --> 01:55:18,280
You remember that night?
We sat together

1565
01:55:18,360 --> 01:55:20,240
we watched old Ben Burns
and Stickleton.

1566
01:55:20,560 --> 01:55:21,840
That night, something just...

1567
01:55:22,840 --> 01:55:23,840
clicked.

1568
01:55:32,960 --> 01:55:35,000
<i>Racing hasn't changed
and it never will.</i>

1569
01:55:38,600 --> 01:55:40,520
(Foreign language)

1570
01:55:40,640 --> 01:55:42,760
It doesn't matter
if racing never changes.

1571
01:55:43,120 --> 01:55:45,760
What matters is
if we let racing change us.

1572
01:55:50,840 --> 01:55:54,360
<i>When I'm in a T-180, I don't know,
everything just makes sense.</i>

1573
01:55:55,920 --> 01:56:00,400
No hesitation, nothing fazes him.
No one seems capable of stopping him!

1574
01:56:00,480 --> 01:56:01,480
He's on a mission.

1575
01:56:01,560 --> 01:56:04,080
With a quarter lap to go,
Speed Racer is back.

1576
01:56:05,600 --> 01:56:10,360
- Two cars between him and destiny.
- Stop him!

1577
01:56:11,080 --> 01:56:12,280
Here we go again.

1578
01:56:21,480 --> 01:56:22,480
(Foreign language)

1579
01:56:23,800 --> 01:56:25,200
- No!
- (Spanish) Come on!

1580
01:56:32,840 --> 01:56:33,840
Yeah!

1581
01:56:48,360 --> 01:56:50,240
Speed Racer, whoo!

1582
01:57:35,960 --> 01:57:37,200
Yes!

1583
01:57:37,600 --> 01:57:38,680
Yeah!

1584
01:57:51,920 --> 01:57:53,560
<i>It's pandemonium!</i>

1585
01:57:53,640 --> 01:57:56,160
<i>People here have gone
completely crazy!</i>

1586
01:57:56,240 --> 01:57:59,320
In 14 years, we've never seen
anything like this.

1587
01:57:59,400 --> 01:58:02,600
It's a whole new world, baby.
It's a whole new world.

1588
01:58:38,520 --> 01:58:39,520
He did it.

1589
01:58:41,840 --> 01:58:42,840
Yes, he did.

1590
01:58:43,160 --> 01:58:44,640
This could change everything.

1591
01:58:46,040 --> 01:58:47,200
It already has.

1592
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:53,880
My men are bringing the family down.
Do you want to go with them?

1593
01:58:56,760 --> 01:58:57,760
No.

1594
01:59:00,120 --> 01:59:01,240
Can I ask you a question?

1595
01:59:03,240 --> 01:59:06,400
Do you ever think you made a mistake,
hiding the truth from them?

1596
01:59:52,840 --> 01:59:53,840
If I did...

1597
01:59:56,200 --> 01:59:57,880
it's a mistake I have to live with.

1598
02:00:34,360 --> 02:00:35,360
Speed!

1599
02:00:38,120 --> 02:00:39,120
Come on!

1600
02:00:40,440 --> 02:00:43,040
Thank you, Speed.
I love you, sweetie.

1601
02:00:43,440 --> 02:00:45,000
That was so beautiful.

1602
02:00:45,720 --> 02:00:46,720
I'm proud of you, son.

1603
02:00:59,240 --> 02:01:01,840

or cootie sensitive viewers.

1606
02:02:45,240 --> 02:02:46,760
<i>Okay, Chim Chim, go!</i>

1607
02:02:46,960 --> 02:02:48,080
<i>Speed, are you all right?</i>

1608
02:02:48,160 --> 02:02:49,856
<i>Never mind that, Trixie.
I've gotta get you out of here.</i>

1609
02:02:49,880 --> 02:02:51,600
<i>You're wonderful, Speed.</i>

1610
02:02:52,720 --> 02:02:54,920
<i>Why don't you try to win this race
fair and square?</i>

1611
02:02:55,000 --> 02:02:56,760
<i>You have beaten us, Speed Racer</i>

1612
02:02:56,840 --> 02:02:59,520
<i>but I solemnly swear,
you will pay for our defeat!</i>

1613
02:02:59,600 --> 02:03:01,120
<i>We will race you again!</i>

1614
02:03:01,280 --> 02:03:02,280
<i>Soon.</i>

1615
02:03:02,360 --> 02:03:04,720
<i>And we will beat you!</i>

1616
02:05:14,840 --> 02:05:16,016
<i>We'll be counting on you, Speed</i>

1617
02:05:16,040 --> 02:05:17,280
<i>and the future of world peace</i>

1618
02:05:17,360 --> 02:05:18,600
<i>will rest upon your shoulders.</i>
