1
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,520
I don't know how it started!

2
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:52,235
- Jacob, how much did you pay for this?
- Do me a favor?

3
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:54,945
Don't talk about my car.
It's a 1928 Ford.

4
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:58,600
How do you have patience with this man?

5
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:00,580
C'mon C'mon!

6
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:03,520
All good.

7
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:06,580
He is alive!

8
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:07,945
Turn it up!

9
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:14,945
<i>...an Orthodox-Jewish organization, Irgoun,
is responsible for the attack in Palestine.</i>

10
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:17,695
<i>Hated by the British, feared by the Arabs and
rejected by the majority of the Jewish community,</i>

11
00:03:17,715 --> 00:03:21,080
<i>including the "Haganah", another secret Jewish
armed force. An attack repudiated by the majority.</i>

12
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:22,980
Jacob, come on, turn it on!

13
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,815
Let's go.

14
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:27,580
Hey, Bobby!

15
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:29,300
Bobby, where are you going? Bobby!

16
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:30,820
"Fanelli"

17
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,120
By God, don't you watch where you're going?

18
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,720
It could have killed me!

19
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,720
- Damn, it was you who came in suddenly.
- Are you alone?

20
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:51,300
Yes, do you see anyone else?

21
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:57,500
Let's go...

22
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:59,880
Let's go!

23
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:07,720
It was at the Kingston Hotel.
British were hit.

24
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:09,923
Irgoun claimed
responsibility for the attack.

25
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,140
90 deaths.

26
00:04:11,175 --> 00:04:13,280
Shit! For what?

27
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:15,120
Why did they do it?

28
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:20,080
- Jew? - Yes and you?

29
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,300
No.

30
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:27,820
I'm an Arab from Jerusalem.
Said Chahine.

31
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,120
Bobby Goldman.

32
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,400
Where you go?

33
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:37,280
Fanelli. They have a radio.

34
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,000
Where is Cathy?

35
00:04:58,580 --> 00:04:59,385
Guess what!

36
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:01,200
It has problems?

37
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:03,380
She is studying in Colombia.

38
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:05,500
Said, this is Jane from Montreal.

39
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:08,820
What a perfect moment!
She's a "digger" like me.

40
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:13,020
Archaeologist, if you don't mind.

41
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:14,020
You are cute!

42
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:19,580
Said Chahine, what are you working on?

43
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:22,300
What discussion did I just interrupt?

44
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:24,560
Palestine.

45
00:05:24,595 --> 00:05:27,480
- Said's family is from there.
- Said...

46
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:30,700
It's a beautiful name, and...

47
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:32,720
It is...

48
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:38,080
...I said that maybe Palestine
belonged to the Jews for

49
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:41,320
two thousand years, but
we have lived there forever.

50
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:45,880
Yes, but the number of Jews
has been higher for years!

51
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,620
Can we have a drink?

52
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:52,780
I would love to dance.

53
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:01,200
Hello!

54
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:02,880
How are you?

55
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:05,472
- I'm sorry I arrived late!
- Can you keep quiet?

56
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:08,309
- I can't think!
- What you mean? - Girls!

57
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:11,280
Girls? Do I have breasts?

58
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:14,880
4, 3, 2, 1!

59
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:17,720
Happy New Year!

60
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:19,460
You must understand, no one should

61
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:22,100
force my people to leave their land,

62
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:23,580
their houses... Jerusalem...

63
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:25,600
No one is asking you
to leave Jerusalem, Said!

64
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:29,720
It is a partition, so that both
can live together in peace.

65
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:31,400
Don't be so naive, please!

66
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:33,420
To be blunt, listen to me!

67
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:37,500
Jews will never share Jerusalem!

68
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:40,300
No one will force my people to leave

69
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:44,400
their land, their home... Jerusalem...

70
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:51,900
What about "Fanelli"?

71
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:54,900
I'll pay for the trip. Let's Dance.

72
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:58,300
I don't want to see you like this.

73
00:06:58,380 --> 00:06:59,920
No way!

74
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:03,080
I'd rather be with Jacob.

75
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:08,620
I have a new car.

76
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:10,380
Is it true that it's new?

77
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:12,300
Shut up and go in.

78
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:15,680
Come on, get in quickly!

79
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:22,920
It's a 1940 Cadillac; Show
more enthusiasm, please!

80
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:36,400
When you said you paid almost

81
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:39,920
nothing, tell me how much is nothing?

82
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:46,180
I'll give it to you, Said!

83
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,160
What?

84
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,560
The car is yours.

85
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,020
No, it's a joke!

86
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:52,180
No, I don't need it anyway.

87
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:57,180
I will go to Palestine tomorrow.

88
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:00,380
This is wonderful!

89
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,829
I want to be there in time to
participate in the vote and face the Arabs.

90
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,480
And I want to fight!

91
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,220
Shut up, Jacob!

92
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,780
Said, no, wait!

93
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:11,720
Don't listen to him!

94
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,100
Oh no!

95
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,240
Oh, Bobby!

96
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,280
Listen, I love Said too.

97
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,580
But in reality, he is Arab...

98
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:22,100
Go to hell!

99
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,820
Said, wait!

100
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:25,780
He doesn't know what he's saying!

101
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,800
He's right.

102
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:30,180
- What you mean?
- Read.

103
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,560
What is this?

104
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,180
It's my uncle's.

105
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,880
He gave it to me before my father died.

106
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:40,500
You want me in Jerusalem
for the same reasons!

107
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:42,600
Crazy!

108
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:45,620
They are both crazy!

109
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:49,100
Look at each other, look at each other!

110
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:50,920
How can you leave her?

111
00:08:51,421 --> 00:08:53,321
And you, don't you worry?

112
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:57,680
How can you do this?

113
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,600
Their immigration expectations are good.

114
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,180
Damn Jews! Trying to enter illegally?

115
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,420
Those fields of war are unbearable.

116
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:01,020
- American from America?
- Yes.

117
00:10:01,521 --> 00:10:02,421
New York.

118
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:08,520
And Jewish. You have nothing
against New York, do you?

119
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,280
Do you have a kiss for me?

120
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:30,520
Oh, no, no kiss, no, no!

121
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,880
To Jerusalem!

122
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:36,000
I will show you my beautiful princess!

123
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,240
Look at this!

124
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,800
Isn't it beautiful?

125
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,100
Look at this!

126
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,220
My car!

127
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,080
Do you have any idea what you're doing?

128
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:53,020
Excavations stopped until the vote.

129
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:57,380
Not bad, we just found
an old passage in some

130
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:03,800
ruins, something from
8th century Judaism.

131
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:10,580
What the fuck was that?

132
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:13,580
Something fell.

133
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:14,620
It's the engine.

134
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,420
I shouldn't have taken it all off!

135
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:17,260
Curse!

136
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:20,440
Get your damn asses out of the
car! What the fuck is wrong with you?

137
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:24,580
Damn it, it's on fire!
Get up, it's burning!

138
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:29,580
Give me a hand!

139
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:39,300
What?

140
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,620
The road is now really very dangerous!

141
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,520
Where does it come from?

142
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,380
From New York. Why dangerous?

143
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,820
It's a perfect place for an ambush.

144
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,480
Excellent!

145
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:57,020
- There's no other?
- Just one, from Tel-aviv to Jerusalem.

146
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:01,120
Bobby, look!

147
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:06,700
This is Tel Aviv.

148
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:07,980
To get to Jerusalem from here, we

149
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:10,780
need to pass through many villages.

150
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:14,580
Arab Villages!

151
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,445
There are 3 strategic places:
the sacred monastery of Latroun,

152
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:22,820
Bab el Oued, and Castle.

153
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,680
Full of riches!

154
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:30,280
Napoleon, Solomon, everyone knew
that whoever achieved this position...

155
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,900
would have the root,
and whoever has the root...

156
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,300
There is Jerusalem!

157
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:43,400
- What did he say?
- It's the English.

158
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,800
Stay where you are.

159
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,800
Whose weapon is this?

160
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,000
It's mine!

161
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,780
Follow us.

162
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,420
Wait a moment.

163
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,520
You know why we carry weapons:

164
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,580
to defend us, because they don't!

165
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:13,780
Please excuse us.

166
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:15,080
Where are they going to take her?

167
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,660
To the nearest police station.

168
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:19,320
The nearest post is in an Arab Village.

169
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,300
She is Jewish.

170
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:31,280
- Take me too. - Take her too.

171
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,120
Bobby, wait for me!

172
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,400
- Where are you going?
- Stay there!

173
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:43,140
You know how I am! Damn English!

174
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:21,100
After the vote, the English leave.

175
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:22,400
Nobody knows what happens.

176
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:26,420
My mother is scared.

177
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:36,620
She doesn't understand, because we've
always lived together and well in the city.

178
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:46,380
For the celebration, Jews offer grain.

179
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:50,480
We give bread and honey at

180
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:58,120
the end of the Easter celebration.

181
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:07,480
Is not the same thing.

182
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:08,780
She is scared.

183
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:13,280
She's starting to think that...

184
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:19,680
all Jews are enemies.

185
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,280
I'm sorry, Bobby.

186
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,980
I offended you.

187
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:38,220
What did he say?

188
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:44,280
That every Jew is an enemy.

189
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:57,020
Thank you very much.

190
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:04,500
- And you, what do you think?
- I think my mother is obsessed

191
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:07,900
for her beliefs. Oh, come on!

192
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,800
My God!

193
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,920
Can you say that again?

194
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,100
There...

195
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:37,920
the holy sepulchre.

196
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:43,200
Built where Jesus died on the cross.

197
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:45,300
That is Mount Moriah.

198
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:48,180
Muhammad ascended to heaven from there.

199
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,280
Over there...

200
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,700
the wailing wall.

201
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:54,420
Part of the temple that
was built by King Solomon.

202
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,957
If God isn't here, Bobby...

203
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,780
It's nowhere!

204
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:02,880
Do you know what Jerusalem means in Hebrew?

205
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:05,820
Jerusalem?

206
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:08,400
The city of peace.

207
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:12,520
If I forget ancient Jerusalem,

208
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:16,180
my right hand will forget to count.

209
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:22,000
And my tongue will
cleanse the roof of my mouth,

210
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:25,720
if I do not proclaim
Jerusalem the highest!

211
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:36,400
He asked what I believe, Bobby.

212
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:39,600
I am scared.

213
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:42,320
We have the same God...

214
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:44,180
you and I.

215
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:11,045
<i>This day will be engraved
in the memory of men.</i>

216
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:15,045
<i>After five centuries of Turkish dictatorship
and 26 years of British protection,</i>

217
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:22,080
<i>the assembly of 56 UN countries will decide
whether Palestine will be divided into two states,</i>

218
00:18:22,115 --> 00:18:23,345
<i>one side Arab and the other Jewish.</i>

219
00:18:23,346 --> 00:18:26,127
M. Husseini, you represent the Palestinians.
What do you think of the vote?

220
00:18:26,147 --> 00:18:28,147
If the UN votes for partition,

221
00:18:28,548 --> 00:18:32,548
the Palestinian will not accept it.
He will throw Jews into the sea.

222
00:18:34,344 --> 00:18:36,544
Where did we go wrong, Rodgers?

223
00:18:36,745 --> 00:18:38,845
We leave chaos behind us.

224
00:18:39,046 --> 00:18:43,246
Thousands of people expect
us to massacre each other.

225
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:45,547
But as far as all together,

226
00:18:45,748 --> 00:18:51,348
none of our soldiers. None!

227
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:54,700
From the tragedy of Europe, we know

228
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:58,080
that the foundation of a strong State

229
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:02,100
It is the only guarantee not
to repeat the same tragedy.

230
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:06,400
Tonight, the world will decide our fate.

231
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:12,680
For those who suffered most among us...
our brothers who died in the fight.

232
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:14,720
Let's give our blessings.

233
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:17,800
For this day, for all of them!

234
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,700
Jacob, do you know these people?

235
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,520
Don't worry Bobby, sit down.

236
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:27,500
Hi Jacob.

237
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,380
- And the vote?
- We are waiting.

238
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:48,680
Americans are putting
pressure on Greeks, Filipinos...

239
00:19:48,715 --> 00:19:52,880
The UN is a puppet!
We are 40 million Arabs united.

240
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:56,520
We cannot allow it!

241
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:04,220
Come, my prince!

242
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:08,220
What happened to the brothers?

243
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,400
In Damascus I had to buy

244
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,900
15 rifles with my own money.

245
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:21,000
It seems that our
brothers don't act like us.

246
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,120
I fear...

247
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:27,820
that we have to fight alone!

248
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:35,620
Decisions are being
made and will not take long.

249
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:38,700
I should be in Cairo in 2 hours.

250
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:41,200
How are your roses?

251
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:45,020
You didn't come to ask
me about roses, Gordon.

252
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:48,300
If the United Nations gives the State

253
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:50,000
to the Jews, we will be out in 6 months.

254
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:53,820
Until then there will be no
intervention between Arabs and Jews.

255
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:56,420
London doesn't want any more bloodshed.

256
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:00,880
Now that the Jews want a state, if they
give it to them, we will see what to do.

257
00:21:00,915 --> 00:21:03,865
In a few months the Arabs
"throw" them into the sea.

258
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:07,220
So do the English wash their hands
in the midst of this hellish chaos?

259
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:09,360
Simply defending the
interests of the former British.

260
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:13,265
Iraq, Suez Canal, oil...

261
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:15,300
the Arabs are our allies.

262
00:21:15,335 --> 00:21:17,180
Our mission...

263
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:20,180
should be to bring peace
between Arabs and Jews.

264
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:22,980
So, I withdraw.

265
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:26,000
- What will you do about the vote?
- I already know what will happen.

266
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:27,500
Good luck!

267
00:21:38,801 --> 00:21:42,101
The General Assembly is meeting.

268
00:21:42,102 --> 00:21:44,102
We can start now.

269
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,280
<i>Afghanistan...</i>

270
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,880
<i>no.</i>

271
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:55,180
<i>Argentina. Argentina... abstention.</i>

272
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:59,880
<i>Australia... yes.</i>

273
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:05,680
<i>Belgium... yes.</i>

274
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:10,380
<i>El Salvador... abstention.</i>

275
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:14,680
<i>Ethiopia... abstention.</i>

276
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:20,080
<i>France... yes.</i>

277
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:22,940
<i>As for the public...</i>

278
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:28,580
<i>I hope they don't
commit any interference...</i>

279
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,940
<i>in voting and debate.</i>

280
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:38,980
<i>They must trust this system
as I trust their behavior.</i>

281
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:42,265
<i>Greece... no.</i>

282
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:45,500
<i>Guatemala. Yes.</i>

283
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:49,500
<i>Ukraine... yes.</i>

284
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:54,100
<i>South Africa... yes.</i>

285
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:57,400
<i>Soviet Union... yes.</i>

286
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:01,200
<i>United Kingdom... abstention.</i>

287
00:23:01,235 --> 00:23:04,217
<i>United States... yes.</i>

288
00:23:04,252 --> 00:23:08,000
<i>Paraguay... yes.</i>

289
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:11,200
<i>Venezuela... yes.</i>

290
00:23:11,235 --> 00:23:15,700
<i>Yemen... no.</i>

291
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,400
<i>Yugoslavia.</i>

292
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:20,440
<i>Abstention.</i>

293
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,300
Come.

294
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:39,060
Hang on.

295
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:07,100
Close the doors, please!

296
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:13,220
Now...

297
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:18,000
catastrophe is upon us!

298
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:22,520
May God protect Palestine!

299
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:29,280
May God protect us all!

300
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:33,460
- Hello.
- Said!

301
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:34,760
What's? I'm waiting for you.

302
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:36,540
I can't talk now because...

303
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:43,720
He's Jewish, don't talk to him again!

304
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,720
Come on, take this!

305
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:51,800
It was our father's.

306
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:55,820
Are you blind, Said?

307
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:58,200
I see nothing but hate.

308
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:00,100
It's not what our father taught us.

309
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:01,520
This is "Jihad", Said.

310
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:04,980
"Jihad" is our duty.

311
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:07,580
No, Amin.

312
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:09,780
God doesn't want war.

313
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:15,120
He doesn't want war.

314
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:25,720
What is happening? Where are they going?

315
00:25:25,721 --> 00:25:28,521
Around the city!

316
00:25:28,622 --> 00:25:33,122
We're going to fight!

317
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,000
It is with her?

318
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,500
Not me...

319
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:46,100
I tried to kiss her, but
the partition was declared.

320
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:50,800
Yes, and she pushed him!

321
00:25:57,420 --> 00:26:00,320
Did you call Cathy?

322
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:05,180
Did you ask if she's coming?

323
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:13,400
Are you scared?

324
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:15,220
I understand.

325
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:16,780
They're scared.

326
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:23,620
Go home. You two, come back!
One is enough, Bobby.

327
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,860
Idiots! You are few.

328
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:32,800
The Arabs outnumber them by millions!

329
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:35,472
- Don't you understand?
- 2000 years in this country...

330
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:39,280
Yes, we have lived here for over 2000 years.

331
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:41,320
You didn't vote and I have to leave?

332
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:44,820
Go to hell! Shut up!

333
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:48,680
Would you kill, Jacob?

334
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:50,700
Said, would you kill?

335
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:52,066
Would they kill each other?

336
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,180
So shut up!

337
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:02,100
What the fuck is that?

338
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:05,180
Come back! come back!

339
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:10,340
Should we go.

340
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:14,980
The English held them back.

341
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,540
Damn crazy people!

342
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:20,280
Stop them!

343
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,680
Stop them!

344
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,320
Give me the gun!

345
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:44,520
Go!

346
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:08,980
Open up, open up!

347
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,499
Jacob, Jacob!

348
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:26,500
I'll take you inside!

349
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:32,220
Go home tomorrow!

350
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:09,620
<i>Days of violence followed
the partition of Palestine.</i>

351
00:29:09,655 --> 00:29:14,920
<i>The Jewish barracks in
the ancient city are on fire.</i>

352
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:29,400
I know I know!

353
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:32,900
No lectures, please, I'm exhausted!

354
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:34,400
Jacob didn't want me to come.

355
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:35,780
And that?

356
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:37,780
Well, now I'm here.

357
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:44,800
You're on my side, aren't you, Bobby?

358
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:58,545
<i>What Jews must do is wait.</i>

359
00:29:58,580 --> 00:30:06,280
<i>No Jew should leave home, the
kibbutz, or work without permission.</i>

360
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:08,080
Father, father!

361
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:09,880
Here.

362
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:15,575
Yael!

363
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:21,619
They're evacuating Scheikh Jerrah,
Katamon, all the mixed districts.

364
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:25,795
Taking refuge in the Jewish districts.

365
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:29,920
They are leaving the area free for the
Arabs. We have to change the situation.

366
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:32,920
Fight hard!

367
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:14,310
They attacked the Semíramis Hotel.

368
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:17,520
Call Amin, quickly!

369
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:23,880
If his brother is there, Said! Go!

370
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:05,740
Amin!

371
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:08,120
Amin!

372
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:15,420
Where is Amin?

373
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:25,900
Amin!

374
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:32,200
Amin?

375
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:34,440
Amin!

376
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:36,640
Amin.

377
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:38,100
Y... Said!

378
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:40,440
S... Said.

379
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:44,140
- Amin, Amin!
- Said, Said!

380
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:46,320
Amin!

381
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:53,120
Help!

382
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:55,920
Swear to me, Said!

383
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:59,200
Swear to me, Said!

384
00:33:01,301 --> 00:33:02,501
Avenge daddy!

385
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:05,820
Take my gun.

386
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:10,140
Swear, swear, Said!

387
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:17,020
My little brother!

388
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:18,840
No!

389
00:33:25,341 --> 00:33:26,541
Yes.

390
00:33:27,343 --> 00:33:30,343
I swear, my little brother!

391
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:40,380
I swear to avenge his death, before God!

392
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:20,220
He'll come with the money right now.

393
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:22,120
All good?

394
00:34:22,321 --> 00:34:23,821
Very well my friend.

395
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:26,380
- You do good business, huh?
- Yes.

396
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:29,320
You need weapons, I need money.

397
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,520
Do you have a cigarette?

398
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:37,000
I don't like this one, I prefer Americans.

399
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:39,680
Too weak for me.

400
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:43,700
I'll bring one in two minutes.

401
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:48,100
Hey Daoud! Daud!

402
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:15,160
<i>After the attack on the Jewish Agency,</i>

403
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:18,800
<i>our mission will be to take
the Jewish district of Jerusalem,</i>

404
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:21,520
<i>cutting off the only supply route.</i>

405
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:24,540
<i>We must starve the Jews of Jerusalem,</i>

406
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:28,240
<i>we must strangle Jerusalem.</i>

407
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:34,280
We can lose Tel-Aviv, but
we cannot lose Jerusalem.

408
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:36,880
If we lose it, we will

409
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:38,200
never have a State.

410
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:44,200
- We are 2000, they are millions!
- Isaac, do you think I don't know?

411
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:46,180
There's not much we can do.

412
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:47,180
To fight!

413
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:49,300
Do you want us to fight with a few weapons?

414
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:53,420
Yes, we will fight with Haganah!

415
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:56,300
They're children, David, not an army.

416
00:35:56,380 --> 00:36:01,820
Today, Haganah will be an army.

417
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:14,900
Maybe we can avoid a war. The King
of Jordan. We can negotiate with him.

418
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:16,840
- Go talk to him
- Me?

419
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:19,380
Talk to him and buy time.

420
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:21,800
Time!

421
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:53,720
<i>Salam.</i>

422
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:55,920
Shalom, your majesty.

423
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:59,920
We said the word peace twice.

424
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:03,600
May God show us the way.

425
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:08,700
Thanks.

426
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:11,880
I will be direct.

427
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:13,760
If they want my intervention
with the Arabs they

428
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:18,920
must deny the proclamation
they made as a State.

429
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:22,900
If Mr. Ben Gourion refuses this proposal,

430
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:27,180
I fear it will be an inevitable war.

431
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:28,300
His majesty...

432
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:30,880
We can never accept it.

433
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:33,020
You know. Of course we want peace...

434
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:36,700
but we also want our own land.

435
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:39,100
Your Majesty, you

436
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:41,180
know that if there is a war

437
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:43,880
We will fight with all our might.

438
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:46,680
I know.

439
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:52,480
We can live together.
We were created to live together.

440
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:56,120
Your Majesty, we are
your only true friends.

441
00:37:56,180 --> 00:38:01,162
I wouldn't be standing before
you if I didn't think the same.

442
00:38:01,163 --> 00:38:02,750
I believe, with all my heart...

443
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,500
that it was...

444
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:08,540
It was divine providence
who brought the Jews.

445
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:11,420
But be patient.

446
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:13,580
How can you ask for patience

447
00:38:13,781 --> 00:38:18,281
after suffering so much in
the extermination camps?

448
00:38:18,382 --> 00:38:20,782
Yes I understand.

449
00:38:24,482 --> 00:38:28,382
Our destinies are in the hands of Allah.

450
00:38:28,483 --> 00:38:32,483
Let's hope he wants to support our cause.

451
00:38:33,421 --> 00:38:36,321
We have to take Castle.

452
00:38:36,322 --> 00:38:38,322
Abdel Kader takes Castle!

453
00:38:38,323 --> 00:38:41,323
We must, we must!

454
00:38:41,324 --> 00:38:43,324
For a day, a few hours...

455
00:38:43,325 --> 00:38:47,325
The time needed for
important trains to pass.

456
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:51,320
Never ask how, okay?

457
00:38:51,321 --> 00:38:54,321
But... we have 20 men...

458
00:38:54,322 --> 00:38:55,822
Get more...

459
00:38:57,123 --> 00:38:57,523
Where?

460
00:38:57,624 --> 00:38:59,324
I don't know, I don't care!

461
00:38:59,325 --> 00:39:02,125
Everyone, everyone must
participate in this operation.

462
00:39:02,126 --> 00:39:03,826
Did you understand? Each one!

463
00:39:09,327 --> 00:39:12,327
Bobby, the first.

464
00:39:12,328 --> 00:39:14,328
You are the first.

465
00:39:14,329 --> 00:39:20,529
We must go to Jerusalem to find
Golan and make a deal with him.

466
00:39:20,530 --> 00:39:24,330
No Isaac, that doesn't interest him.

467
00:39:24,331 --> 00:39:28,831
David said we need every Jew, every one.

468
00:39:31,332 --> 00:39:34,332
For months, Jews have been
trying to regain control of the road.

469
00:39:34,333 --> 00:39:36,833
We have been fighting them for months.

470
00:39:36,934 --> 00:39:38,334
Many of our men are dead.

471
00:39:38,335 --> 00:39:41,335
We need weapons now.

472
00:39:41,336 --> 00:39:44,336
Otherwise the Jews will cross, and all

473
00:39:44,337 --> 00:39:48,337
these sacrifices will have been in vain!

474
00:39:48,338 --> 00:39:52,538
They promised tanks, give them to us.
We need weapons now!

475
00:39:52,839 --> 00:39:53,239
Come on, calm down!

476
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:56,221
All your men are irregular.
They don't know anything about weapons.

477
00:39:56,241 --> 00:39:59,341
Is not true! We need weapons now!

478
00:40:02,344 --> 00:40:05,344
What if the Jews surpass you?

479
00:40:05,345 --> 00:40:07,345
And take the weapons we give you?

480
00:40:07,346 --> 00:40:08,246
So, my brothers?

481
00:40:08,347 --> 00:40:10,847
How can you call us brothers...

482
00:40:10,948 --> 00:40:13,148
and then...

483
00:40:13,349 --> 00:40:15,549
refuse to help us?

484
00:40:16,350 --> 00:40:23,350
At least we cut their
supply load from the US

485
00:40:23,351 --> 00:40:26,151
and Europe this week
so they can't get help.

486
00:40:26,152 --> 00:40:29,252
Oil is one thing,
Palestine another, brother.

487
00:40:29,353 --> 00:40:31,853
If the Jews don't take the road,

488
00:40:31,954 --> 00:40:37,354
we can pursue them from Jerusalem
and from every village in Palestine,

489
00:40:37,355 --> 00:40:44,155
in less than two weeks.

490
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:48,860
Come on, traitors!

491
00:40:49,361 --> 00:40:51,361
Syrians, Egyptians, Iraqis,

492
00:40:51,362 --> 00:40:54,362
Lebanese, all traitors!

493
00:40:54,363 --> 00:40:58,563
The Palestinian blood
will be on your hands.

494
00:41:05,164 --> 00:41:06,364
David!

495
00:41:10,365 --> 00:41:12,265
David, hi!

496
00:41:13,267 --> 00:41:14,567
All good?

497
00:41:21,368 --> 00:41:23,368
We have to take the Castle, we need men.

498
00:41:23,369 --> 00:41:28,369
So Irgoun is no longer
a bunch of killers?

499
00:41:28,370 --> 00:41:34,370
There's only a handful of us left!

500
00:41:34,371 --> 00:41:38,371
You cut the Bab el
Oued road and we attack.

501
00:41:38,372 --> 00:41:41,172
Why don't we take Castelo together?

502
00:41:41,373 --> 00:41:42,373
It does not give.

503
00:41:42,374 --> 00:41:45,374
Do you want my men
and I to risk our lives?

504
00:41:45,375 --> 00:41:46,375
Yes.

505
00:41:46,376 --> 00:41:50,376
Two women starved to death in Jerusalem.

506
00:41:50,377 --> 00:41:51,377
What you want?

507
00:41:51,378 --> 00:41:53,178
Money?

508
00:41:53,379 --> 00:41:56,879
There's nothing to buy.

509
00:41:57,380 --> 00:41:59,880
No.

510
00:42:01,381 --> 00:42:05,581
I want guarantees.

511
00:42:09,382 --> 00:42:12,582
Think about it.

512
00:43:43,384 --> 00:43:45,584
Shalom. Shalom.

513
00:43:49,385 --> 00:43:52,385
The Arabs closed the

514
00:43:52,386 --> 00:43:55,186
only road to Jerusalem.

515
00:43:55,387 --> 00:43:58,287
We need to do...

516
00:43:58,388 --> 00:44:02,388
because there are
100,000 Jewish prisoners

517
00:44:02,389 --> 00:44:07,389
trapped in the old part of the city.

518
00:44:07,390 --> 00:44:08,390
They need supplies...

519
00:44:08,391 --> 00:44:12,391
or they will die.

520
00:44:12,392 --> 00:44:13,392
And with them, our State...

521
00:44:13,393 --> 00:44:18,593
before being born.

522
00:44:19,394 --> 00:44:21,394
We must do...

523
00:44:21,395 --> 00:44:24,395
because Jerusalem...

524
00:44:24,396 --> 00:44:26,396
It is the heart of Judaism.

525
00:44:26,397 --> 00:44:29,397
It belongs to these people, all of them.

526
00:44:29,398 --> 00:44:37,398
We cannot allow what they are doing.

527
00:44:37,399 --> 00:44:43,199
You are hope, children!

528
00:44:46,301 --> 00:44:50,301
I just wanted to say this before you go.

529
00:44:50,302 --> 00:44:54,102
Mazal Tov (good luck), my children!

530
00:45:08,303 --> 00:45:09,303
Come on, Cathy.

531
00:45:09,304 --> 00:45:10,304
You have nothing to do with this war.

532
00:45:10,305 --> 00:45:15,805
Why? Jerusalem is also a
Christian city, did you know that?

533
00:47:32,306 --> 00:47:35,306
Hold fire!

534
00:47:35,307 --> 00:47:36,307
Arrest the prisoners!

535
00:47:36,308 --> 00:47:39,308
Two guards with them now!

536
00:47:39,309 --> 00:47:43,309
It doesn't matter the casualties,
Jews or Arabs! Take care of them too!

537
00:47:43,310 --> 00:47:46,310
I want a guard on the summit now!

538
00:47:46,311 --> 00:47:48,311
The rest over there!

539
00:47:48,312 --> 00:47:51,312
I want three guards as quickly as I can!

540
00:47:51,313 --> 00:47:53,313
It won't be that easy.

541
00:47:53,314 --> 00:47:54,314
Just do it!

542
00:47:54,315 --> 00:47:56,315
Give me the phone.

543
00:47:56,316 --> 00:47:58,116
David!

544
00:47:59,317 --> 00:48:01,317
David, I'm here.

545
00:48:01,318 --> 00:48:04,518
We have controlled the Castelo area.

546
00:49:00,323 --> 00:49:05,323
Listen to me, we can't deal with them!
Are many! We must return through the west.

547
00:49:05,324 --> 00:49:09,324
Gather your men...

548
00:49:09,325 --> 00:49:10,825
Go, go!

549
00:49:15,326 --> 00:49:17,326
Golan, where the fuck are you?

550
00:49:17,327 --> 00:49:18,827
I see the damn Arabs.

551
00:49:28,130 --> 00:49:32,830
We lost Castelo, we are withdrawing.

552
00:49:35,332 --> 00:49:39,832
Come on, let's go!

553
00:50:34,340 --> 00:50:36,340
Why are they screaming?

554
00:50:36,341 --> 00:50:39,141
Abu Musah is dead.

555
00:50:39,242 --> 00:50:40,842
Abu Musah?

556
00:50:44,344 --> 00:50:50,144
They abandoned Castle, let's go!

557
00:50:50,245 --> 00:50:58,245
Come on, let's go back to Castelo!

558
00:51:28,346 --> 00:51:30,346
Bobby...

559
00:51:30,347 --> 00:51:34,347
you killed my uncle.

560
00:51:34,348 --> 00:51:37,348
Bobby...

561
00:51:37,349 --> 00:51:40,349
my uncle!

562
00:51:40,350 --> 00:51:42,350
No.

563
00:51:42,351 --> 00:51:43,351
No!

564
00:51:43,352 --> 00:51:45,152
No!

565
00:52:17,353 --> 00:52:23,153
I killed Said's uncle.

566
00:52:23,354 --> 00:52:26,354
I didn't come here to fight.

567
00:52:26,355 --> 00:52:29,355
I came to find peace.

568
00:52:29,356 --> 00:52:30,356
There will be peace.

569
00:52:30,357 --> 00:52:33,357
No.

570
00:52:33,358 --> 00:52:37,358
Jews kill Arabs, Arabs kill Jews...

571
00:52:37,359 --> 00:52:39,359
Blood brings more blood,

572
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:42,360
and pain, more pain...

573
00:52:42,361 --> 00:52:46,361
This hatred will grow.

574
00:52:46,362 --> 00:52:49,362
There must be an end.

575
00:52:49,363 --> 00:52:53,163
There is always an end!

576
00:52:54,364 --> 00:52:59,364
Day always follows night.

577
00:52:59,365 --> 00:53:02,165
Ever.

578
00:53:10,366 --> 00:53:12,366
The SS, they wanted...

579
00:53:12,367 --> 00:53:18,167
they wanted young women.

580
00:53:18,368 --> 00:53:23,868
I wanted to live...

581
00:53:26,369 --> 00:53:31,369
They gave me a lot more to eat

582
00:53:31,370 --> 00:53:36,370
than others, all because...

583
00:53:36,371 --> 00:53:44,371
they didn't want thin women.

584
00:53:45,372 --> 00:53:51,172
I did what they wanted.

585
00:53:51,373 --> 00:53:57,374
I wanted to die, every day,

586
00:53:57,375 --> 00:54:01,175
but...

587
00:54:03,376 --> 00:54:08,176
I continued doing what they wanted.

588
00:54:08,377 --> 00:54:11,177
They made me...

589
00:54:11,178 --> 00:54:15,378
one thing.

590
00:54:15,379 --> 00:54:20,379
We thought it would be

591
00:54:20,380 --> 00:54:21,380
Americans who would free us,

592
00:54:21,381 --> 00:54:26,181
but it was the Russians.

593
00:54:26,382 --> 00:54:31,382
Then I knew what awaited me.

594
00:54:31,383 --> 00:54:33,383
The other women pointed

595
00:54:33,384 --> 00:54:38,284
out that I was the Nazis' bitch.

596
00:54:38,285 --> 00:54:42,185
For bread.

597
00:54:42,386 --> 00:54:45,586
I did.

598
00:54:50,387 --> 00:54:56,388
And now I'm here, in Palestine.

599
00:54:56,389 --> 00:54:59,889
It saw?

600
00:55:06,390 --> 00:55:10,890
There's always an end.

601
00:55:11,391 --> 00:55:14,591
Day always follows night.

602
00:55:31,192 --> 00:55:33,192
Look, Bobby!

603
00:55:33,393 --> 00:55:34,893
Look!

604
00:57:15,394 --> 00:57:18,194
<i>"If I forget you, oh, Jerusalem"</i>

605
00:57:19,397 --> 00:57:22,397
...at the same moment, a
few kilometers from Castelo,

606
00:57:22,398 --> 00:57:25,298
Irgoun and Stern,
dissident extremist groups,

607
00:57:25,299 --> 00:57:30,599
attacked the Arab village of Deir Yassin.

608
00:58:12,300 --> 00:58:16,300
The Haganah had nothing to do here.

609
00:58:16,301 --> 00:58:19,301
Is this what you needed our weapons for?

610
00:58:19,302 --> 00:58:23,302
This is outside our jurisdiction.

611
00:58:23,303 --> 00:58:29,303
I assumed it would protect us.

612
00:58:29,304 --> 00:58:31,304
Is this what they wanted?

613
00:58:31,305 --> 00:58:33,305
A victory for yourselves?

614
00:58:33,306 --> 00:58:36,306
For Irgoun.

615
00:58:36,307 --> 00:58:37,307
For this worm.

616
00:58:37,308 --> 00:58:38,308
We tried to warn them,

617
00:58:38,309 --> 00:58:42,309
but the truck's speaker was broken.

618
00:58:42,310 --> 00:58:45,110
Son of a bitch!

619
00:58:49,311 --> 00:58:52,311
Tell your men to drop their weapons.

620
00:58:52,312 --> 00:58:55,312
Do it or I'll shoot, I swear!

621
00:58:55,313 --> 00:58:58,313
Don't move!

622
00:58:58,314 --> 00:59:00,314
Come on, David!

623
00:59:00,315 --> 00:59:01,315
Shoot!

624
00:59:01,316 --> 00:59:05,816
Come on, David, shoot!

625
00:59:13,317 --> 00:59:16,317
My God, Golan!

626
00:59:16,318 --> 00:59:23,818
You can't get things
by killing these people!

627
00:59:25,319 --> 00:59:29,319
Damn you!

628
00:59:29,320 --> 00:59:34,120
Damn you!

629
00:59:38,321 --> 00:59:43,321
Lower your weapons!

630
00:59:43,322 --> 00:59:50,122
Do what you want, damn pig!

631
01:00:22,323 --> 01:00:26,123
Listen to me, all of you!

632
01:00:27,324 --> 01:00:31,324
Let's bury Abou Moussa in the

633
01:00:31,325 --> 01:00:33,325
Dome of the Rock, like a saint!

634
01:00:33,326 --> 01:00:36,326
Abdel Kader will be elevated

635
01:00:36,327 --> 01:00:41,127
to heaven, as Muhammad was.

636
01:00:41,328 --> 01:00:48,328
Then, we will be together,
and we will reproduce

637
01:00:48,329 --> 01:00:56,129
in numbers, for our revenge
and that of our people!

638
01:01:02,330 --> 01:01:03,330
The Jewish Agency
reported that it ignored

639
01:01:03,331 --> 01:01:07,331
the projects of the
Stern group and Irgoun.

640
01:01:07,332 --> 01:01:12,332
David Ben Gourion sent a message

641
01:01:12,333 --> 01:01:13,333
to King Abdullah expressing his regret...

642
01:01:13,334 --> 01:01:14,334
What are you doing?

643
01:01:14,335 --> 01:01:16,335
I'll go see him.

644
01:01:16,336 --> 01:01:18,336
Who?

645
01:01:18,337 --> 01:01:20,137
Said.

646
01:01:20,338 --> 01:01:23,338
You can't do that!

647
01:01:23,339 --> 01:01:25,239
They will kill you! Not now, not today!

648
01:01:25,240 --> 01:01:26,340
I have to find him.

649
01:01:26,341 --> 01:01:28,341
You can't do that!

650
01:01:28,342 --> 01:01:30,342
Don't do that, Bobby!

651
01:01:30,343 --> 01:01:31,343
Don't do that!

652
01:01:31,344 --> 01:01:33,344
Not today!

653
01:01:33,345 --> 01:01:36,346
Not today, they are furious!

654
01:01:36,347 --> 01:01:40,347
He will kill you!

655
01:01:40,348 --> 01:01:42,848
Bobby?

656
01:01:58,349 --> 01:02:00,549
I love you!

657
01:02:09,350 --> 01:02:10,350
<i>Arab leaders ordered</i>

658
01:02:10,351 --> 01:02:12,351
<i>to its people to take to the streets</i>

659
01:02:12,352 --> 01:02:17,852
<i>after the massacre in Deir Yassin.</i>

660
01:02:22,353 --> 01:02:26,553
American journalist. Said Chahine.

661
01:02:29,354 --> 01:02:31,354
I am an American journalist.

662
01:02:31,355 --> 01:02:33,555
Said!

663
01:02:35,356 --> 01:02:40,556
An American journalist wants to see you.

664
01:02:58,357 --> 01:03:00,857
Said, it's me!

665
01:03:01,258 --> 01:03:04,158
Said, please, I...

666
01:03:04,259 --> 01:03:08,359
Said, where are you going?

667
01:03:08,360 --> 01:03:10,360
Did we kill him?

668
01:03:10,361 --> 01:03:13,361
Take care of him.
Let it return to the Jews.

669
01:03:13,362 --> 01:03:18,862
And if you touch a strand
of his hair, I'll kill you.

670
01:03:25,363 --> 01:03:31,363
May 14, 1948.

671
01:03:31,364 --> 01:03:35,364
After 26 years of occupation,

672
01:03:35,365 --> 01:03:37,365
British troops leave Palestine.

673
01:03:37,366 --> 01:03:40,367
In Jerusalem, the British troops

674
01:03:40,368 --> 01:03:42,368
parades for the last time.

675
01:03:42,369 --> 01:03:46,370
With their old trucks, they accompany,

676
01:03:46,371 --> 01:03:47,371
some English soldiers, who go

677
01:03:47,372 --> 01:03:52,372
down the streets of Jerusalem.

678
01:03:54,373 --> 01:03:57,373
Good morning, Rabbin Weingarten.

679
01:03:57,374 --> 01:04:02,374
I understand that after
the 70s, the "key" to

680
01:04:02,375 --> 01:04:07,375
Jerusalem has not been
in the hands of the Jews.

681
01:04:07,376 --> 01:04:10,376
This will be the first
time in 19 centuries

682
01:04:10,377 --> 01:04:14,377
that your people will
have this privilege.

683
01:04:14,378 --> 01:04:21,178
This is the key to the door of Zion.

684
01:04:21,379 --> 01:04:27,379
Our relationship was difficult,
but we can try to be friends.

685
01:04:27,380 --> 01:04:29,880
Goodbye.

686
01:04:35,316 --> 01:04:36,316
It's like the Germans say.

687
01:04:36,317 --> 01:04:38,317
We must strike hard and fast!

688
01:04:38,318 --> 01:04:42,018
Starting with Latroun!

689
01:04:42,119 --> 01:04:45,319
We must decide on a central command.

690
01:04:45,320 --> 01:04:47,320
Jews are united and we must

691
01:04:47,321 --> 01:04:50,321
Form a unified army to fight them.

692
01:04:50,323 --> 01:04:52,323
May I suggest that His Majesty King

693
01:04:52,324 --> 01:04:55,224
Abdullah be our commander in chief?

694
01:04:55,300 --> 01:04:57,800
He is the most experienced.

695
01:04:58,326 --> 01:05:00,326
A royal army cannot receive orders

696
01:05:00,327 --> 01:05:05,327
from a sovereign other than its own.

697
01:05:05,328 --> 01:05:09,328
So we are all in agreement.

698
01:05:09,329 --> 01:05:14,329
We will fight together, apart.

699
01:05:14,330 --> 01:05:19,830
And may Allah protect us!

700
01:05:20,331 --> 01:05:22,331
Gentlemen, please, please wait!

701
01:05:22,332 --> 01:05:24,232
Please follow me!

702
01:05:24,333 --> 01:05:28,333
This country is the birthplace
of the Jewish people.

703
01:05:28,334 --> 01:05:32,334
It was here that a civilization of

704
01:05:32,335 --> 01:05:36,335
universal importance was created.

705
01:05:36,336 --> 01:05:38,336
It was here that the

706
01:05:38,337 --> 01:05:41,337
Book of Books was written.

707
01:05:41,338 --> 01:05:43,338
A gift to the world.

708
01:05:43,339 --> 01:05:47,339
Survivors of the European catastrophe

709
01:05:47,340 --> 01:05:52,340
demand the right to live with dignity,

710
01:05:52,341 --> 01:05:55,341
freedom and work.

711
01:05:55,342 --> 01:05:59,342
They fought ceaselessly

712
01:05:59,343 --> 01:06:02,343
to enter Palestine.

713
01:06:02,344 --> 01:06:06,344
To prevent crimes and
claim the rights of our people,

714
01:06:06,345 --> 01:06:10,345
we proclaimed the
founding of the Jewish State,

715
01:06:10,346 --> 01:06:14,346
in the Holy Land.

716
01:06:14,347 --> 01:06:19,147
The State will be called Israel.

717
01:06:20,349 --> 01:06:27,349
We have solid inspiration... peace!

718
01:06:27,350 --> 01:06:32,550
Let's stand!

719
01:06:38,351 --> 01:06:43,951
The State of Israel was born.

720
01:06:44,152 --> 01:06:49,352
Two days have passed since Ben
Gourion declared the State of Israel.

721
01:06:49,353 --> 01:06:54,253
Armed Arabs lay siege to Jerusalem.

722
01:06:54,354 --> 01:06:59,254
Coming from Baghdad, Amman, Cairo,

723
01:06:59,355 --> 01:07:01,355
Damascus and Beirut, the armed Arabs

724
01:07:01,356 --> 01:07:04,356
and the Palestinian

725
01:07:04,357 --> 01:07:06,157
irregulars declared war

726
01:07:06,158 --> 01:07:10,558
to the new Jewish State.

727
01:07:14,159 --> 01:07:15,359
Is the monastery empty?

728
01:07:15,360 --> 01:07:16,260
No.

729
01:07:16,361 --> 01:07:19,261
We are here, praying.

730
01:07:19,362 --> 01:07:21,862
Yes of course.

731
01:07:22,363 --> 01:07:23,363
I'm very sorry.

732
01:07:23,364 --> 01:07:27,164
Are there no Jewish soldiers?

733
01:07:28,365 --> 01:07:33,365
Major Abdullah Tell, Arab Legion
of King Abdullah of Transjordan.

734
01:07:33,366 --> 01:07:37,166
I request the Latroun Monastery.

735
01:07:48,367 --> 01:07:53,367
The road, Djamal. From now on,
nothing and no one will pass through it.

736
01:07:53,368 --> 01:08:00,868
The Jews of Jerusalem will
starve and finally surrender.

737
01:08:43,369 --> 01:08:45,369
Speak English?

738
01:08:45,370 --> 01:08:53,370
I'm Bobby Goldman.
I'm in charge. Welcome to Israel.

739
01:09:04,171 --> 01:09:05,371
How many?

740
01:09:05,372 --> 01:09:08,372
This boat is another
that is about to arrive.

741
01:09:08,373 --> 01:09:10,373
712 people.

742
01:09:10,374 --> 01:09:12,374
From Czechoslovakia, Russia,

743
01:09:12,375 --> 01:09:13,375
Poland and Hungary.

744
01:09:13,376 --> 01:09:16,176
Military training?

745
01:09:16,377 --> 01:09:18,377
I do not believe this.

746
01:09:18,378 --> 01:09:20,378
They must attack Latroun.

747
01:09:20,379 --> 01:09:22,279
The path to Jerusalem is blocked.

748
01:09:22,280 --> 01:09:28,580
Lord, at least allow them to rest.

749
01:09:32,281 --> 01:09:33,381
Sir.

750
01:09:33,382 --> 01:09:37,882
Why are these unfortunates here?

751
01:09:40,283 --> 01:09:42,383
Because they need a homeland.

752
01:09:42,384 --> 01:09:45,384
And why am I here?

753
01:09:45,385 --> 01:09:48,385
Because your country needs them.

754
01:09:48,386 --> 01:09:49,586
No!

755
01:09:50,387 --> 01:09:53,387
You are ignoring the
seriousness of the situation.

756
01:09:53,388 --> 01:09:55,188
I need them,

757
01:09:55,389 --> 01:09:59,189
men and women, now!

758
01:10:08,290 --> 01:10:09,590
David!

759
01:10:11,391 --> 01:10:13,391
Give them food.

760
01:10:13,392 --> 01:10:15,392
Let them rest.

761
01:10:15,393 --> 01:10:17,293
Make them feel at home.

762
01:10:17,386 --> 01:10:23,186
Tomorrow, a rifle for those
capable and two days of training.

763
01:10:30,387 --> 01:10:34,887
Yael, come translate.

764
01:10:42,088 --> 01:10:43,988
One, for movement.

765
01:10:44,089 --> 01:10:47,389
Hold him here and kick
as hard as you can...

766
01:10:47,390 --> 01:10:52,190
and quickly hit here.

767
01:10:55,391 --> 01:10:58,591
Here, right here.

768
01:11:02,392 --> 01:11:06,192
On the shoulder, here!

769
01:11:06,393 --> 01:11:10,893
Boys, hold on tight and shoot!

770
01:12:35,394 --> 01:12:37,394
They are broken!

771
01:12:37,395 --> 01:12:42,895
They want this road. It's their route.

772
01:12:47,396 --> 01:12:50,396
I didn't want this carnage!

773
01:12:50,397 --> 01:12:52,397
I wanted to enter

774
01:12:52,398 --> 01:12:55,898
Jerusalem, save the holy city.

775
01:13:04,399 --> 01:13:05,299
Yael?

776
01:13:05,300 --> 01:13:07,500
She is dead.

777
01:13:28,301 --> 01:13:30,301
Stop the engine.

778
01:13:30,302 --> 01:13:34,302
Does anyone know where we are?

779
01:13:34,303 --> 01:13:35,303
Stop the engine.

780
01:13:35,304 --> 01:13:38,804
Let's rest here.

781
01:13:56,305 --> 01:13:58,505
Bobby.

782
01:14:00,306 --> 01:14:02,506
Yael.

783
01:14:06,307 --> 01:14:09,107
Yael is dead.

784
01:14:15,308 --> 01:14:18,108
She is dead.

785
01:14:36,309 --> 01:14:39,109
Stop there, hands up!

786
01:14:39,310 --> 01:14:42,810
Hands up!

787
01:14:49,311 --> 01:14:51,211
What?

788
01:14:51,309 --> 01:14:54,209
David?

789
01:14:54,310 --> 01:14:59,110
I'm so happy to see you!

790
01:15:00,311 --> 01:15:01,211
Thank God!

791
01:15:01,312 --> 01:15:03,312
Where are you from?

792
01:15:03,313 --> 01:15:06,113
Jerusalem.

793
01:15:08,114 --> 01:15:10,314
Bobby, listen to me.

794
01:15:10,315 --> 01:15:13,315
I found a way between
Tel-aviv and Jerusalem.

795
01:15:13,316 --> 01:15:20,116
I'm sure we can supply Jerusalem.

796
01:15:20,317 --> 01:15:21,317
We need to build a road.

797
01:15:21,318 --> 01:15:23,118
Is very difficult!

798
01:15:23,319 --> 01:15:28,319
To build the road we will need
workers, we will need everything

799
01:15:28,320 --> 01:15:31,320
so that the trucks cross every
day, trucks, dozens of them!

800
01:15:31,321 --> 01:15:32,821
Where?

801
01:15:33,322 --> 01:15:36,322
South of Latroun...

802
01:15:36,323 --> 01:15:39,323
The US and Russia are
demanding a ceasefire.

803
01:15:39,324 --> 01:15:41,324
- A ceasefire? - That's right.

804
01:15:41,325 --> 01:15:42,325
This means...

805
01:15:42,326 --> 01:15:44,326
Yes I know.

806
01:15:44,327 --> 01:15:46,327
The Arabs will never accept it.

807
01:15:46,328 --> 01:15:47,328
And the English?

808
01:15:47,329 --> 01:15:52,229
The English only help when it matters.

809
01:15:52,330 --> 01:15:53,330
It would be a miracle.

810
01:15:53,331 --> 01:15:55,131
Lord, sir!

811
01:15:55,332 --> 01:15:58,332
They're calling you on the radio.

812
01:15:58,333 --> 01:16:01,533
It's from Jerusalem, Isaac.

813
01:16:06,334 --> 01:16:10,034
Does Isaac know his daughter died?

814
01:16:10,035 --> 01:16:11,235
No.

815
01:16:11,336 --> 01:16:13,336
David, we need a miracle here.

816
01:16:13,337 --> 01:16:15,337
We need food now.

817
01:16:15,338 --> 01:16:17,338
Without the ceasefire we will have nothing.

818
01:16:17,339 --> 01:16:20,239
We need more than a miracle.

819
01:16:20,331 --> 01:16:23,631
David?

820
01:16:34,332 --> 01:16:36,532
Bags on the back!

821
01:16:39,333 --> 01:16:41,333
It's impossible, I said!

822
01:16:41,334 --> 01:16:43,334
It weighs a ton!

823
01:16:43,335 --> 01:16:46,335
The weight of the bag was calculated.

824
01:16:46,336 --> 01:16:48,336
Where are they going with this? To where?

825
01:16:48,337 --> 01:16:50,337
We are too old to fight.

826
01:16:50,338 --> 01:16:54,338
2000 people are arrested.

827
01:16:54,339 --> 01:16:55,339
At the Synagogue.

828
01:16:55,340 --> 01:16:58,340
That's where we're going.

829
01:16:58,341 --> 01:17:02,341
The only thing they had to
eat yesterday was dry bread.

830
01:17:02,342 --> 01:17:07,342
We can't take much, but we can take hope.

831
01:17:07,343 --> 01:17:08,543
Hope.

832
01:17:10,144 --> 01:17:13,344
So, those who want,

833
01:17:13,345 --> 01:17:15,345
and only those who want,

834
01:17:15,346 --> 01:17:17,346
will take these packages.

835
01:17:17,347 --> 01:17:21,347
The content of each one will

836
01:17:21,348 --> 01:17:25,148
save a life, for another day.

837
01:18:06,349 --> 01:18:07,349
Don't look him in the eye.

838
01:18:07,350 --> 01:18:10,350
Never speak without permission.

839
01:18:10,351 --> 01:18:14,351
Although he speaks his mother

840
01:18:14,352 --> 01:18:16,352
tongue, he will speak to a king.

841
01:18:16,353 --> 01:18:18,353
I know your courage, my

842
01:18:18,354 --> 01:18:20,354
son, and your disappointment.

843
01:18:20,355 --> 01:18:24,355
But what do the English
and Americans demand

844
01:18:24,356 --> 01:18:26,156
is that we accept the ceasefire.

845
01:18:26,157 --> 01:18:28,157
Refuse.

846
01:18:28,158 --> 01:18:31,358
For God!

847
01:18:31,359 --> 01:18:34,359
It won't cost him a soul
to drive away the Jews.

848
01:18:34,360 --> 01:18:38,360
An assault for religion.

849
01:18:38,361 --> 01:18:40,861
Only one.

850
01:18:43,362 --> 01:18:47,162
An intervention in Jerusalem

851
01:18:47,363 --> 01:18:51,363
You will break the agreement
with the British, Your Majesty.

852
01:18:51,364 --> 01:18:54,364
The Jews resist, Your Majesty.

853
01:18:54,365 --> 01:18:56,365
We must accept the ceasefire.

854
01:18:56,366 --> 01:18:59,366
We must use this time
to gather our strength.

855
01:18:59,367 --> 01:19:00,367
Does not make sense.

856
01:19:00,368 --> 01:19:04,368
We haven't had a single defeat
and they want to withdraw?

857
01:19:04,369 --> 01:19:12,369
Do you think the Jews will do
nothing during the ceasefire?

858
01:19:13,370 --> 01:19:15,370
Save the holy city, and you will

859
01:19:15,371 --> 01:19:18,371
become the king of Jerusalem!

860
01:19:18,372 --> 01:19:19,372
How dare you?

861
01:19:19,373 --> 01:19:21,873
Enough.

862
01:19:28,174 --> 01:19:30,574
It's the King, sir.

863
01:19:35,375 --> 01:19:38,275
We can't wait any longer.

864
01:19:38,376 --> 01:19:42,476
Let's save Jerusalem.

865
01:19:54,377 --> 01:20:00,277
The ceasefire will take
effect on June 10th at 10 am.

866
01:20:00,378 --> 01:20:05,278
You have until that day, with
my legion, to take Jerusalem.

867
01:20:05,379 --> 01:20:09,280
At 10 am, on June 11th,

868
01:20:09,381 --> 01:20:14,882
all hostilities activities must end.

869
01:21:22,383 --> 01:21:25,583
They are at the entrance to the palace.

870
01:21:26,384 --> 01:21:29,284
We can go in from behind.

871
01:21:29,385 --> 01:21:30,285
How many?

872
01:21:30,386 --> 01:21:32,286
Many.

873
01:21:32,387 --> 01:21:33,387
I will be back.

874
01:21:33,388 --> 01:21:36,288
We cannot risk lives.

875
01:21:36,389 --> 01:21:39,189
I will be back.

876
01:21:39,390 --> 01:21:41,290
Hang on.

877
01:21:41,391 --> 01:21:43,291
There is an underground passage.

878
01:21:43,392 --> 01:21:44,292
What the hell are you talking about?

879
01:21:44,393 --> 01:21:49,193
From a friend, knowledgeable
about cars and archeology.

880
01:21:50,394 --> 01:21:52,594
I trust him.

881
01:22:10,395 --> 01:22:11,295
This is crazy!

882
01:22:11,396 --> 01:22:14,196
We have to go back!

883
01:22:29,397 --> 01:22:30,397
I love you Jacob!

884
01:22:30,398 --> 01:22:32,898
Thanks.

885
01:22:48,399 --> 01:22:49,299
Is everyone okay?

886
01:22:49,300 --> 01:22:51,800
All good?

887
01:23:12,301 --> 01:23:15,101
Where is Yael?

888
01:24:17,002 --> 01:24:20,302
The synagogue must be
taken before the ceasefire.

889
01:24:20,303 --> 01:24:23,303
I will not let my legionnaires
fight in the city streets.

890
01:24:23,304 --> 01:24:27,104
They weren't trained for that.
This will sentence them to death.

891
01:24:27,305 --> 01:24:29,705
We continue with the snipers.

892
01:24:29,806 --> 01:24:31,206
It will be too late!

893
01:24:31,307 --> 01:24:32,307
The Jews are weak.

894
01:24:32,308 --> 01:24:34,208
Here, in Jerusalem, they will give up.

895
01:24:34,309 --> 01:24:37,109
The Jews?

896
01:24:37,310 --> 01:24:39,210
Jews never give up.

897
01:24:39,311 --> 01:24:42,111
We must act now.

898
01:24:42,210 --> 01:24:44,010
Send your men down the avenue.

899
01:24:44,111 --> 01:24:46,211
My men can't open the door.

900
01:24:46,312 --> 01:24:53,112
There will be hundreds of dead
before they make the first move.

901
01:26:16,314 --> 01:26:19,214
Rest assured.

902
01:26:19,315 --> 01:26:27,315
Get out of here!

903
01:27:43,317 --> 01:27:48,117
Come on, get up!

904
01:27:48,318 --> 01:27:52,118
It is me! It's me, Goldberg!

905
01:27:52,319 --> 01:27:54,819
Help-me!

906
01:28:11,318 --> 01:28:16,818
It's okay, everything will be fine.

907
01:28:17,119 --> 01:28:19,119
I will take care of you.

908
01:28:23,320 --> 01:28:25,820
Who has morphine?

909
01:28:26,321 --> 01:28:33,121
- I need morphine now!
- Bobby... keep her.

910
01:28:34,322 --> 01:28:39,122
I went back. I came back to you.

911
01:28:53,323 --> 01:28:57,223
I can't!

912
01:28:57,324 --> 01:29:01,524
Shabbat!

913
01:29:09,324 --> 01:29:14,224
I love you. I love you lots!

914
01:29:14,326 --> 01:29:16,526
Listen to me.

915
01:29:17,327 --> 01:29:19,127
Marry me!

916
01:29:19,328 --> 01:29:21,228
Are you listening to me?

917
01:29:21,329 --> 01:29:26,229
Be my wife, marry me.
Come on, look at me, marry me.

918
01:29:26,330 --> 01:29:28,130
Yes?

919
01:29:28,331 --> 01:29:34,831
Where is the rabbi?

920
01:29:40,329 --> 01:29:43,129
Come come!

921
01:29:43,330 --> 01:29:44,330
Isaac!

922
01:29:44,331 --> 01:29:46,831
Isaac!

923
01:29:48,332 --> 01:29:50,232
Need you Now!

924
01:29:50,333 --> 01:29:53,133
Take care of him.

925
01:29:56,334 --> 01:29:59,134
Marry us.

926
01:30:01,835 --> 01:30:05,235
Said, be my witness.

927
01:30:05,336 --> 01:30:07,236
David... Issac...

928
01:30:07,334 --> 01:30:09,234
The ring, the ring!

929
01:30:09,335 --> 01:30:10,535
Wait one moment.

930
01:30:15,336 --> 01:30:18,536
Look at me.

931
01:30:19,337 --> 01:30:21,237
Stay with me.

932
01:30:21,338 --> 01:30:22,838
Look at me.

933
01:30:23,339 --> 01:30:27,239
I beg you!

934
01:30:27,339 --> 01:30:29,539
Look at me.

935
01:30:34,337 --> 01:30:39,137
Give her the ring, and say with me:

936
01:30:59,338 --> 01:31:02,138
Now you are my wife forever.

937
01:31:02,339 --> 01:31:05,539
Forever.

938
01:31:35,340 --> 01:31:37,140
Bobby.

939
01:31:53,341 --> 01:31:56,241
"If I forget you,

940
01:31:56,342 --> 01:31:59,142
"oh, Jerusalem..."

941
01:32:04,343 --> 01:32:07,543
May Allah be with you both!

942
01:32:09,344 --> 01:32:10,244
What is that?

943
01:32:10,345 --> 01:32:12,545
Stopped?

944
01:32:13,346 --> 01:32:14,846
It's the time...

945
01:32:15,347 --> 01:32:16,847
of the ceasefire.

946
01:32:52,548 --> 01:32:57,248
There are very few of them, I
thought there would be more.

947
01:32:57,349 --> 01:33:02,149
I suggest you maintain your positions.

948
01:33:02,350 --> 01:33:05,250
- Are they in their positions?
- Yes.

949
01:33:05,351 --> 01:33:09,151
What are your fortifications?

950
01:33:09,352 --> 01:33:10,852
Here.

951
01:33:19,353 --> 01:33:22,253
Djamal, take them to the doctors.

952
01:33:22,354 --> 01:33:26,154
Allah is witness,
they will not do anything bad.

953
01:33:34,355 --> 01:33:37,555
All good? David, how are you?

954
01:34:02,356 --> 01:34:04,256
When hostilities resumed

955
01:34:04,357 --> 01:34:07,257
after six days of attacks,

956
01:34:07,358 --> 01:34:11,258
the Israelis considered
strengthening their positions.

957
01:34:11,359 --> 01:34:16,159
Soldiers and weapons also arrived,

958
01:34:16,360 --> 01:34:20,260
thanks to the route through the hills.

959
01:34:20,361 --> 01:34:23,161
The road.

960
01:34:56,355 --> 01:35:00,255
Thousands of lives
were lost in those battles.

961
01:35:00,356 --> 01:35:07,256
According to the United Nations,
750,000 Palestinians were exiled.

962
01:35:07,357 --> 01:35:09,257
Wars followed wars, creating a

963
01:35:09,358 --> 01:35:14,858
circle of violence, distrust and hatred.

964
01:35:17,359 --> 01:35:24,859
However, men like Bobby and Said
will continue to fight each other for peace.

965
01:35:26,360 --> 01:35:29,260
Despite all the suffering, we must hope

966
01:35:29,361 --> 01:35:33,261
that the struggle for
peace will flourish,

967
01:35:33,362 --> 01:35:34,262
and that one day, the city

968
01:35:34,363 --> 01:35:36,268
of Arabs and Jews can live

969
01:35:36,363 --> 01:35:39,863
under the meaning of his name:

970
01:35:40,364 --> 01:35:42,564
City of peace.

971
01:36:24,365 --> 01:36:32,365
"Pray for the peace of Jerusalem May there be peace within your
walls, and prosperity within your palaces." (Psalm of David)
