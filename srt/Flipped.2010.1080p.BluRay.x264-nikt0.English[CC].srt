163
00:09:15,142 --> 00:09:16,477
<i>"Visually challenged"?</i>

164
00:09:16,643 --> 00:09:20,856
<i>This from the girl who lived in a house
that was the joke of the neighborhood?</i>

165
00:09:21,398 --> 00:09:25,319
<i>They had bushes growing over windows
and weeds all over the place.</i>

166
00:09:25,861 --> 00:09:27,988
<i>It bugged my dad big time.</i>

167
00:09:28,155 --> 00:09:29,323
Oh, there he is.

168
00:09:29,656 --> 00:09:33,827
The bricklayer who thinks he's a painter.
That truck's not ugly enough in real life?

169
00:09:33,994 --> 00:09:35,496
He's gotta make a painting of it?

170
00:09:35,662 --> 00:09:38,749
No, he does landscapes.
Sells them at the county fair.

171
00:09:38,916 --> 00:09:40,501
People say they're beautiful.

172
00:09:40,667 --> 00:09:43,420
Landscapes? Let me tell you something.

173
00:09:43,587 --> 00:09:45,506
The world would have
more beauty in it...

174
00:09:45,672 --> 00:09:49,593
...if he'd do a little landscaping
on that piece of crap he calls a yard.

175
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,763
PATSY: I feel bad for his wife.
She married a dreamer.

176
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:56,308
Because of that, one of the two of them
will always be unhappy.

177
00:09:56,475 --> 00:09:59,770
Yeah, fine.
But why do we have to be unhappy?

178
00:10:00,479 --> 00:10:02,397
BRYCE: <i>As annoying as the yard was
to my dad...</i>

179
00:10:02,564 --> 00:10:06,068
<i>...it was nothing compared to how annoying
Juli Baker was in that tree.</i>

180
00:10:06,235 --> 00:10:07,986
JULI:
Three blocks away.

181
00:10:08,153 --> 00:10:10,322
BRYCE: <i>Every morning
we had to listen to the sound...</i>

182
00:10:10,489 --> 00:10:12,533
<i>...of her blow-by-blow traffic report.</i>

183
00:10:12,699 --> 00:10:14,034
JULI:
Two blocks.

184
00:10:14,201 --> 00:10:15,452
WOMAN:
There you go.

185
00:10:15,661 --> 00:10:17,412
Why do they call it The Three Stooges?

186
00:10:17,579 --> 00:10:19,665
-I mean, there's five of them.
-What?

187
00:10:19,832 --> 00:10:23,252
Well, yeah, there's Moe, Larry, Curly,
Shemp and Curly Joe.

188
00:10:23,418 --> 00:10:26,338
-Yeah, but they only have three at a time.
-Yeah.

189
00:10:26,505 --> 00:10:29,675
You know, I hate Curly Joe.
I mean, he shouldn't even be a Stooge.

190
00:10:29,842 --> 00:10:32,845
MAN: Listen, girl,
I'm this close to calling the police.

191
00:10:33,011 --> 00:10:35,806
You are trespassing and obstructing
progress on a contracted job.

192
00:10:35,973 --> 00:10:38,225
GARRETT: What's going on?
MAN: Either you come down...

193
00:10:38,392 --> 00:10:41,562
...or we're gonna cut you down.
JULI: You guys, come up here with me.

194
00:10:41,895 --> 00:10:43,897
They won't cut it down
if we're all up here.

195
00:10:44,064 --> 00:10:46,108
-Bus, bus, bus.
BRYCE: <i>Juli was frantic.</i>

196
00:10:46,275 --> 00:10:47,901
<i>They wanted to cut down her tree.</i>

197
00:10:48,068 --> 00:10:51,155
<i>I couldn't understand why
that mutant tangle of gnarly branches...</i>

198
00:10:51,321 --> 00:10:53,907
<i>-...meant so much to her.</i>
JULI: Bryce, please.

199
00:10:54,449 --> 00:10:56,243
BRYCE: <i>I felt bad for her.</i>
GARRETT: Leave her.

200
00:10:56,410 --> 00:10:58,245
BRYCE:
<i>But I wasn't about to cut school over it.</i>

201
00:10:58,412 --> 00:10:59,454
GARRETT:
Come on, bro.

202
00:11:00,706 --> 00:11:02,749
CHET:
<i>Why isn't she your friend, Bryce?</i>

203
00:11:04,376 --> 00:11:05,752
You'd have to know Juli.

204
00:11:05,919 --> 00:11:07,254
Well, I'd like to.

205
00:11:07,754 --> 00:11:08,755
Why?

206
00:11:09,464 --> 00:11:11,633
That girl has an iron backbone.

207
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,635
Why don't you invite her over sometime?

208
00:11:14,219 --> 00:11:15,429
An iron backbone?

209
00:11:16,096 --> 00:11:17,639
She's just stubborn...

210
00:11:17,806 --> 00:11:19,433
...and she's pushy beyond belief.

211
00:11:20,184 --> 00:11:21,435
Is that so?

212
00:11:21,602 --> 00:11:23,896
And she's been stalking me
since the second grade.

213
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:27,524
Well, a girl like that
doesn't live next door to everyone.

214
00:11:28,025 --> 00:11:29,318
Lucky them.

215
00:11:30,903 --> 00:11:32,446
Read this.

216
00:11:32,654 --> 00:11:33,780
Without prejudice.

217
00:11:39,328 --> 00:11:42,789
BRYCE: <i>Like I needed to know
anything more about Juli Baker.</i>

218
00:11:44,625 --> 00:11:47,211
<i>Juli wasn't at the bus stop
the next morning.</i>

219
00:11:48,629 --> 00:11:50,005
<i>Or the morning after that.</i>

220
00:11:50,631 --> 00:11:52,591
<i>She was at school,
but you'd never know it.</i>

221
00:11:52,758 --> 00:11:55,552
-Little Joe? He's got so much makeup on--
-He doesn't age.

222
00:11:55,719 --> 00:11:57,888
BRYCE:
<i>I told myself I should be glad about it.</i>

223
00:11:58,055 --> 00:12:00,224
<i>I mean, isn't that what
I'd always wanted?</i>

224
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:03,810
<i>But still, I felt bad for her.</i>

225
00:12:04,561 --> 00:12:07,648
<i>I was gonna tell her I was sorry,
but then I thought, hey, no...</i>

226
00:12:08,106 --> 00:12:09,691
<i>...that's the last thing I needed:</i>

227
00:12:09,858 --> 00:12:12,361
<i>Juli Baker thinking I missed her.</i>

228
00:12:16,365 --> 00:12:18,492
I see why you like to come out here.

229
00:12:19,117 --> 00:12:21,370
Would you mind explaining it
to your mother?

230
00:12:21,787 --> 00:12:23,747
JULI:
<i>I loved to watch my father paint.</i>

231
00:12:23,914 --> 00:12:26,833
<i>Or really, I loved to hear him talk
while he painted.</i>

232
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,336
<i>I learned a lot about my dad that way.</i>

233
00:12:29,503 --> 00:12:31,088
<i>He told me all sorts of things...</i>

234
00:12:31,255 --> 00:12:35,467
<i>...like how he got his first job delivering hay
and how he'd wished he'd finished college.</i>

235
00:12:35,634 --> 00:12:37,594
<i>Then one day he surprised me.</i>

236
00:12:37,761 --> 00:12:42,099
What's going on with you
and, uh, Bryce Loski?

237
00:12:43,684 --> 00:12:45,185
What do you mean? Nothing.

238
00:12:45,477 --> 00:12:47,187
Oh, okay.

239
00:12:47,479 --> 00:12:49,064
My mistake.

240
00:12:49,523 --> 00:12:51,316
Why would you even think that?

241
00:12:51,483 --> 00:12:52,526
No reason.

242
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,945
Just that you...

243
00:12:55,821 --> 00:12:57,406
...talk about him all the time.

244
00:12:58,532 --> 00:12:59,908
I do?

245
00:13:00,534 --> 00:13:02,411
Mm-hm.

246
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:06,373
I don't know.

247
00:13:07,833 --> 00:13:10,419
I guess it's something about his eyes.

248
00:13:11,461 --> 00:13:12,879
Or maybe his smile.

249
00:13:13,964 --> 00:13:15,382
But what about him?

250
00:13:15,841 --> 00:13:19,386
-What?
-You have to look at the whole landscape.

251
00:13:20,387 --> 00:13:21,596
What does that mean?

252
00:13:22,389 --> 00:13:25,684
A painting is more
than the sum of its parts.

253
00:13:26,852 --> 00:13:30,063
A cow by itself is just a cow.

254
00:13:30,522 --> 00:13:35,569
A meadow by itself is just grass,
flowers.

255
00:13:36,153 --> 00:13:40,824
And the sun peeking through the trees
is just a beam of light.

256
00:13:41,408 --> 00:13:43,827
But you put them all together...

257
00:13:44,161 --> 00:13:46,413
...and it can be magic.

258
00:13:47,873 --> 00:13:51,001
JULI: <i>I didn't really understand
what he was saying until one afternoon...</i>

259
00:13:51,168 --> 00:13:53,378
<i>...when I was up in the sycamore tree.</i>

260
00:13:54,087 --> 00:13:56,006
<i>I was rescuing a kite.</i>

261
00:13:56,173 --> 00:13:59,092
<i>It was a long way up,
higher than I'd ever been.</i>

262
00:14:00,052 --> 00:14:03,805
<i>And the higher I got,
the more amazed I was by the view.</i>

263
00:14:04,181 --> 00:14:06,933
<i>I began to notice
how wonderful the breeze smelled.</i>

264
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:09,311
<i>Like sunshine and wild grass.</i>

265
00:14:10,437 --> 00:14:12,814
<i>I couldn't stop breathing it in...</i>

266
00:14:12,981 --> 00:14:15,942
<i>...filling my lungs
with the sweetest smell I'd ever known.</i>

267
00:14:17,027 --> 00:14:18,445
Hey, you found my kite.

268
00:14:18,612 --> 00:14:21,281
Bryce, you should come up here.

269
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:23,450
It's so beautiful.

270
00:14:23,784 --> 00:14:27,287
I can't. I sprained my, um...

271
00:14:27,621 --> 00:14:28,955
I have a rash.

272
00:14:30,082 --> 00:14:33,085
JULI: <i>From that moment on,
that became my spot.</i>

273
00:14:34,711 --> 00:14:38,382
<i>I could sit there for hours,
just looking out at the world.</i>

274
00:14:38,548 --> 00:14:40,842
<i>Some days the sunsets
would be purple and pink.</i>

275
00:14:41,009 --> 00:14:44,805
<i>And some days
they were a blazing orange...</i>

276
00:14:44,971 --> 00:14:47,808
<i>...setting fire to the clouds
on the horizon.</i>

277
00:14:47,974 --> 00:14:50,644
<i>It was during one of those sunsets
that my father's idea...</i>

278
00:14:50,811 --> 00:14:53,563
<i>...of the whole being greater
than the sum of its parts...</i>

279
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:56,316
<i>...moved from my head to my heart.</i>

280
00:14:57,651 --> 00:15:00,987
<i>Some days I would get there extra early
to watch the sunrise.</i>

281
00:15:01,154 --> 00:15:02,989
<i>One morning
I was making mental notes...</i>

282
00:15:03,156 --> 00:15:06,201
<i>...of how the streaks of light
were cutting through the clouds...</i>

283
00:15:06,368 --> 00:15:07,953
<i>...so I could tell my dad...</i>

284
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:10,497
<i>...when I heard a noise below.</i>

285
00:15:10,831 --> 00:15:11,915
Excuse me.

286
00:15:12,082 --> 00:15:15,168
Excuse me. I'm sorry, but you can't
park there. That's a bus stop.

287
00:15:15,335 --> 00:15:16,878
Hey, what are you doing up there?

288
00:15:17,045 --> 00:15:20,006
You can't be up there,
we're gonna take this thing down.

289
00:15:20,173 --> 00:15:23,051
-The tree?
-Yeah. Now come on down.

290
00:15:23,635 --> 00:15:26,763
-But who told you, you could cut it down?
-The owner.

291
00:15:27,264 --> 00:15:28,682
Why?

292
00:15:28,849 --> 00:15:31,268
He's gonna build a house,
and this tree's in the way.

293
00:15:31,435 --> 00:15:36,273
-So come on, girl, we got work to do.
-You can't cut it down. You just can't.

294
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:39,317
Listen, girl.
I'm this close to calling the police.

295
00:15:39,484 --> 00:15:42,696
You are trespassing and obstructing
progress on a contracted job.

296
00:15:42,863 --> 00:15:45,949
Now either you come down,
or we're gonna cut you down.

297
00:15:46,116 --> 00:15:48,285
Go ahead. Cut me down.

298
00:15:48,452 --> 00:15:51,121
I'm not coming down.
I'm never coming down.

299
00:15:52,038 --> 00:15:53,874
Bryce. You guys, come up here with me.

300
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:56,376
They won't cut it down
if we're all up here.

301
00:15:57,210 --> 00:15:59,129
Bryce, please don't let them do this.

302
00:15:59,713 --> 00:16:01,631
Come on, you guys.

303
00:16:02,215 --> 00:16:06,303
Bryce, please. You don't have to
come up this high. Just a little ways.

304
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:10,265
Bryce, please. Please.

305
00:16:11,308 --> 00:16:13,685
JULI:
<i>What happened after that was a blur.</i>

306
00:16:16,813 --> 00:16:19,149
<i>It seemed like the whole town was there.</i>

307
00:16:19,316 --> 00:16:21,443
<i>But still I wouldn't move.</i>

308
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:23,570
<i>Then my father showed up.</i>

309
00:16:23,737 --> 00:16:26,907
<i>He talked a fireman into letting him come up
to where I was.</i>

310
00:16:29,784 --> 00:16:32,162
Sweetie, it's time to come down.

311
00:16:32,412 --> 00:16:34,164
Daddy, please don't let them do this.

312
00:16:34,748 --> 00:16:36,583
-Sweetie...
-Daddy, look.

313
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:40,128
You can see everything.
You can see the whole world from here.

314
00:16:40,587 --> 00:16:43,423
No view is worth my daughter's safety.
Now, come on.

315
00:16:45,425 --> 00:16:46,801
I can't.

316
00:16:47,511 --> 00:16:51,014
Julianna, it's time to come down now.

317
00:16:51,515 --> 00:16:53,517
Please, Daddy.

318
00:16:54,476 --> 00:16:56,228
It's time.

319
00:17:02,651 --> 00:17:04,110
JULI:
<i>And that was it.</i>

320
00:17:05,779 --> 00:17:08,448
<i>I must've cried for two weeks straight.</i>

321
00:17:10,116 --> 00:17:12,827
<i>Oh, sure, I went to school
and did the best I could...</i>

322
00:17:12,994 --> 00:17:14,621
<i>...but nothing seemed to matter.</i>

323
00:17:14,788 --> 00:17:16,957
TEACHER: Juli?
-Huh?

324
00:17:17,958 --> 00:17:19,209
Do you know the answer?

325
00:17:20,585 --> 00:17:22,671
Uh, the Peloponnesian War?

326
00:17:23,463 --> 00:17:25,465
I'm sure that's the answer
to something...

327
00:17:25,632 --> 00:17:27,801
...but I was looking for the area

Wow.

the door open before she knocked.</i>

Don't need them. Give them to the snake"?</i>

-Certainly.

-Nothing like fresh eggs.

deserved eggs too.</i>

550

<i>When she kissed me good night...</i>

823
00:44:16,491 --> 00:44:20,412
<i>...she whispered that of all her
many blessings, I was her best.</i>

824
00:44:23,081 --> 00:44:24,875
<i>I felt sorry for my father.</i>

825
00:44:25,041 --> 00:44:26,751
<i>I felt sorry for my mother.</i>

826
00:44:26,918 --> 00:44:31,047
<i>But most of all,
I felt lucky for me that they were mine.</i>

827
00:44:32,799 --> 00:44:35,594
<i>I wanted to think the reason
I started working on my yard...</i>

828
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:38,972
<i>...had nothing to do with Bryce.
It was about making our house better.</i>

829
00:44:39,139 --> 00:44:42,934
<i>After what he did with the eggs,
why should I care what he thought?</i>

830
00:44:43,226 --> 00:44:44,269
<i>But I did.</i>

831
00:44:44,436 --> 00:44:46,980
Are you pruning that
or trying to hack it to death?

832
00:44:49,691 --> 00:44:52,819
Hi. I'm Chet Duncan,
Bryce's grandfather.

833
00:44:52,986 --> 00:44:55,864
Sorry it's taken me so long
to come over and introduce myself.

834
00:44:56,031 --> 00:44:57,657
Nice to meet you.

835
00:44:58,116 --> 00:45:00,952
So are you trimming all these
to the same height?

836
00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:03,705
Well, yeah, that's what I was thinking,
but I don't know.

837
00:45:03,872 --> 00:45:05,874
Do you think it would look better
to take them out?

838
00:45:06,041 --> 00:45:10,545
Oh, these are Hicksii shrubs.
These will prune up nicely.

839
00:45:13,882 --> 00:45:15,133
Listen, Mr. Duncan.

840
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:16,968
Call me Chet.

841
00:45:17,385 --> 00:45:18,678
Chet.

842
00:45:19,137 --> 00:45:21,556
If you're here
because of what Bryce said...

843
00:45:21,973 --> 00:45:23,308
...I don't need your help.

844
00:45:25,352 --> 00:45:27,520
Read about you in the paper.

845
00:45:28,605 --> 00:45:30,982
Renee would've sat up in that tree
with you.

846
00:45:31,650 --> 00:45:34,611
She would've sat up there all night.

847
00:45:35,403 --> 00:45:36,488
Renee?

848
00:45:37,155 --> 00:45:38,698
My wife.

849
00:45:39,532 --> 00:45:41,076
You remind me a lot of her.

850
00:45:46,498 --> 00:45:48,166
JULI:
<i>We worked on the yard for weeks.</i>

851
00:45:48,333 --> 00:45:51,169
<i>And the whole time we worked,
we talked.</i>

852
00:45:52,003 --> 00:45:53,380
-Right there?
-Perfect, yeah.

853
00:45:53,546 --> 00:45:56,383
JULI: <i>He wanted to know more
about the sycamore tree.</i>

854
00:45:56,675 --> 00:45:58,134
<i>He knew exactly what it meant...</i>

855
00:45:58,301 --> 00:46:01,012
<i>...about the whole being greater
than the sum of its parts.</i>

856
00:46:01,304 --> 00:46:03,181
<i>He said it was the same with people...</i>

857
00:46:03,348 --> 00:46:06,184
<i>...but sometimes with people,
the whole could be less.</i>

858
00:46:06,685 --> 00:46:08,728
<i>I thought that was pretty interesting.</i>

859
00:46:08,895 --> 00:46:11,856
<i>I started looking at people
I'd known since elementary school...</i>

860
00:46:12,023 --> 00:46:15,527
<i>...trying to figure out if they were more
or less than the sum of their parts.</i>

861
00:46:18,446 --> 00:46:21,741
<i>Chet was right. A lot of them were less.</i>

862
00:46:24,452 --> 00:46:28,373
<i>Of all my classmates, the one person
I couldn't seem to place was Bryce.</i>

863
00:46:33,295 --> 00:46:35,964
<i>Until recently, I would've said
with absolute certainty...</i>

864
00:46:36,131 --> 00:46:39,926
<i>...that he was greater, far greater,
than the sum of his parts.</i>

865
00:46:40,093 --> 00:46:41,636
<i>But now I wasn't so sure.</i>

866
00:46:41,803 --> 00:46:44,639
It's looking good, Juli. Nice job.

867
00:46:45,390 --> 00:46:48,435
Thanks. Chet did most of it.

868
00:46:51,271 --> 00:46:53,481
I'm sorry for what I did.

869
00:46:56,860 --> 00:46:58,737
I just don't get it, Bryce.

870
00:46:58,903 --> 00:47:00,864
Why didn't you just tell me?

871
00:47:01,031 --> 00:47:02,574
JULI:
<i>Was he really sorry?</i>

872
00:47:02,741 --> 00:47:05,702
<i>Or was he just saying these things
to make himself feel better?</i>

873
00:47:05,994 --> 00:47:09,497
<i>Then I thought maybe I just wanted him
to be more than the sum of his parts.</i>

874
00:47:10,332 --> 00:47:12,584
<i>But as I looked into his eyes...</i>

875
00:47:12,751 --> 00:47:14,878
<i>...those dazzling eyes...</i>

876
00:47:15,670 --> 00:47:17,297
<i>...for the first time...</i>

877
00:47:17,464 --> 00:47:20,425
<i>...I was pretty sure
that Bryce Loski was less.</i>

878
00:47:30,060 --> 00:47:33,146
We're going to invite the Bakers
over for dinner.

879
00:47:33,313 --> 00:47:35,482
-What?
-I don't know, Mom.

880
00:47:35,648 --> 00:47:37,400
I think that's a marvelous idea.

881
00:47:37,567 --> 00:47:39,694
Patsy, what purpose does this serve?

882
00:47:39,861 --> 00:47:42,238
Trina Baker is a very nice person.

883
00:47:42,405 --> 00:47:45,742
-And Matt and Mark are really cool.
-I hate cool.

884
00:47:45,909 --> 00:47:47,952
Something we should've done years ago.

885
00:47:48,119 --> 00:47:50,622
Yeah, but we didn't. And now we can't.

886
00:47:50,789 --> 00:47:53,124
The statute of limitations has run out.

887
00:47:53,833 --> 00:47:56,044
We're having the Bakers over for dinner.

888
00:47:58,463 --> 00:48:03,093
If this is about what I said last night,
I'm sorry, okay?

889
00:48:03,259 --> 00:48:06,638
But, you know, having them over for dinner
is not gonna fix his brother.

890
00:48:07,097 --> 00:48:08,890
It's going to be a sit-down dinner.

891
00:48:09,057 --> 00:48:11,768
And I expect everyone
to dress accordingly.

892
00:48:11,976 --> 00:48:14,020
Oh, God. Can't we just have a barbecue?

893
00:48:14,187 --> 00:48:17,232
It's going to be a sit-down dinner.

894
00:48:18,858 --> 00:48:20,568
Just shoot me now.

895
00:48:20,902 --> 00:48:22,821
Careful what you wish for.

896
00:48:23,571 --> 00:48:24,739
BRYCE:
<i>So that was it.</i>

897
00:48:24,906 --> 00:48:29,536
<i>A dress-up, sit-down dinner with Juli Baker
was in my immediate future.</i>

898
00:48:31,496 --> 00:48:34,207
<i>And that made seeing Juli at school
more uncomfortable.</i>

899
00:48:34,707 --> 00:48:36,835
<i>I found myself staring at her in class.</i>

900
00:48:37,001 --> 00:48:39,504
<i>And the way her hair fell back
over her shoulders...</i>

901
00:48:39,671 --> 00:48:42,090
<i>...she looked just like the picture
in the newspaper.</i>

902
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:45,802
<i>Dana Tressler caught me watching.</i>

903
00:48:45,969 --> 00:48:48,888
<i>If I didn't do something fast,
this could spread like wildfire.</i>

904
00:48:49,055 --> 00:48:50,765
There was a bee in her hair.

905
00:48:51,850 --> 00:48:52,934
See, there it goes.

906
00:48:55,812 --> 00:48:57,689
There's no bee.

907
00:48:57,856 --> 00:48:59,691
It flew out the window.

908
00:49:00,525 --> 00:49:03,278
BRYCE:
<i>I convinced myself I'd dodged a bullet.</i>

909
00:49:04,195 --> 00:49:06,448
<i>I had to put Juli out of my mind.</i>

910
00:49:06,614 --> 00:49:10,034
<i>Keep the focus on the important stuff
like schoolwork.</i>

911
00:49:13,037 --> 00:49:14,873
<i>My weakness was unnerving.</i>

912
00:49:16,374 --> 00:49:17,417
I need your sharpener.

913
00:49:17,584 --> 00:49:20,545
-You ever heard of knocking?
-Hey, what you got there? Dad's <i>Playboy?</i>

914
00:49:20,795 --> 00:49:22,046
None of your business.

915
00:49:22,297 --> 00:49:25,008
-Give my best to Miss October.
-Get out.

916
00:49:25,383 --> 00:49:27,719
-Or should I say your best? Ha, ha.
-You're disgusting.

917
00:49:29,387 --> 00:49:31,598
BRYCE:
<i>Another disaster avoided.</i>

918
00:49:31,764 --> 00:49:34,058
<i>My life had become a minefield.</i>

919
00:49:34,642 --> 00:49:36,769
GARRETT: Hey, man.
-Hey.

920
00:49:38,730 --> 00:49:40,273
What's this?

921
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:41,733
Whoa.

922
00:49:42,358 --> 00:49:44,235
It's not what you think.

923
00:49:45,528 --> 00:49:48,156
Okay, it is what you think,
but I can explain.

924
00:49:49,157 --> 00:49:51,951
Okay, I can't explain.
Can we just talk about it later?

925
00:49:52,118 --> 00:49:53,745
Whatever you say.

926
00:49:53,912 --> 00:49:55,580
BRYCE:
<i>I had to talk to someone.</i>

927
00:49:55,788 --> 00:49:58,750
<i>Why not Garrett?
Maybe he could help me get back on track.</i>

928
00:49:58,917 --> 00:50:01,628
<i>Garrett was surprisingly sensitive
in matters of the heart.</i>

929
00:50:01,794 --> 00:50:04,088
Are you freaking mental? Juli Baker.
You hate her.

930
00:50:04,255 --> 00:50:07,425
That's what's weird. I don't think I do.
I can't stop thinking about her.

931
00:50:07,592 --> 00:50:10,261
-You got it bad, man.
-Well, what do I do?

932
00:50:10,428 --> 00:50:13,473
Well, you gotta nip this in the bud.
These aren't real emotions.

933
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:16,267
-They're not?
-You feel guilty because of the egg thing.

934
00:50:16,434 --> 00:50:17,936
Yeah, and I insulted her yard.

935
00:50:18,102 --> 00:50:20,313
Exactly. Of course,
the place is a dump anyways.

936
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:24,025
Her dad's got a retarded brother
and all their money goes to helping him.

937
00:50:24,192 --> 00:50:26,861
A retard? Well, shoot,
that ought to tell you something.

938
00:50:27,195 --> 00:50:29,614
-About what?
-About Juli.

939
00:50:30,490 --> 00:50:31,616
What are you saying?

940
00:50:32,158 --> 00:50:34,118
The apple doesn't fall far from the tree.

941
00:50:34,285 --> 00:50:36,955
BRYCE: <i>I couldn't believe it.
I wanted to yell at him.</i>

942
00:50:37,121 --> 00:50:39,958
<i>Tell him that he didn't know Juli
like I did.</i>

943
00:50:40,291 --> 00:50:42,085
<i>But all that came out was:</i>

944
00:50:42,919 --> 00:50:44,587
Heh, oh.

945
00:50:44,754 --> 00:50:47,215
-Right.
-Yeah.

946
00:50:47,382 --> 00:50:50,635
Right. Um, I'll talk to you later.

947
00:50:53,263 --> 00:50:55,682
BRYCE: <i>I was supposed to go
to Garrett's after school...</i>

948
00:50:55,848 --> 00:50:57,475
<i>...but I couldn't be around him.</i>

949
00:50:57,642 --> 00:50:59,310
<i>He'd crossed the line.</i>

950
00:50:59,477 --> 00:51:03,147
<i>And standing right next to him
across that line was my father.</i>

951
00:51:03,606 --> 00:51:05,525
<i>I didn't care what they thought.</i>

952
00:51:05,733 --> 00:51:08,027
<i>I liked Juli Baker.</i>

953
00:51:11,197 --> 00:51:13,366
JULI: <i>Sunday mornings
are peaceful in our house.</i>

954
00:51:13,533 --> 00:51:15,368
<i>My dad lets himself sleep in.</i>

955
00:51:15,535 --> 00:51:17,662
<i>My mother lets herself not fix breakfast.</i>

956
00:51:17,829 --> 00:51:20,623
<i>If my brothers have been out late
playing with their band...</i>

957
00:51:20,790 --> 00:51:23,126
<i>...you won't even know they're around
till noon.</i>

958
00:51:23,293 --> 00:51:26,212
<i>But this Sunday, I woke up feeling weird.</i>

959
00:51:26,379 --> 00:51:29,674
<i>I had to do something to shake off
the confused feelings about Bryce...</i>

960
00:51:29,841 --> 00:51:31,884
<i>...that were starting to creep back in.</i>

961
00:51:39,601 --> 00:51:43,104
You really did it, didn't you? Heh.

962
00:51:44,147 --> 00:51:47,191
-Proud of you.
-Thanks, Dad.

963
00:51:47,525 --> 00:51:51,362
-Where you going?
-To see Daniel. It's his birthday.

964
00:51:53,156 --> 00:51:54,282
I wanna come with you.

965
00:51:54,907 --> 00:51:58,244
Oh, honey, just enjoy the morning,
stay with your mom.

966
00:51:59,787 --> 00:52:02,290
No, Dad. I wanna come.

967
00:52:03,333 --> 00:52:05,168
Sweetheart, listen.

968
00:52:05,335 --> 00:52:07,378
Sometimes, with Daniel--

969
00:52:07,545 --> 00:52:09,213
I'm coming, Dad.

970
00:52:12,175 --> 00:52:13,593
Okay.

971
00:52:14,677 --> 00:52:16,846
We'd better leave a note for your mother.

972
00:52:19,432 --> 00:52:22,352
JULI: <i>In all the years,
I'd never visited my Uncle Daniel.</i>

973
00:52:22,518 --> 00:52:25,813
<i>I don't know why.
It was always something my dad did alone.</i>

974
00:52:26,981 --> 00:52:30,777
<i>We didn't say much to each other on
the drive to Devonhurst, but I didn't care.</i>

975
00:52:31,569 --> 00:52:33,696
<i>I just liked being with my dad.</i>

976
00:52:34,197 --> 00:52:38,076
<i>Somehow the silence seemed to connect us
in a way that words never could.</i>

977
00:52:56,636 --> 00:53:00,515
The residents tend to the grounds
as part of their therapy.

978
00:53:03,601 --> 00:53:07,522
It takes some getting used to.
They're good people, though.

979
00:53:08,940 --> 00:53:10,441
Daniel?

980
00:53:11,234 --> 00:53:12,276
Daniel.

981
00:53:13,277 --> 00:53:16,447
Richard! You're here!

982
00:53:16,614 --> 00:53:18,783
Richard for my birthday.

983
00:53:18,950 --> 00:53:20,952
Who? Richard, who? Who?

984
00:53:21,119 --> 00:53:22,787
Who? Who? Richard, who? Who?

985
00:53:22,954 --> 00:53:25,707
Daniel, Daniel, it's Julianna.
It's my daughter.

986
00:53:26,374 --> 00:53:27,959
Your niece.

987
00:53:29,752 --> 00:53:31,462

-Sherry is breaking up with Mitch.

to be Garrett's idol...</i>
