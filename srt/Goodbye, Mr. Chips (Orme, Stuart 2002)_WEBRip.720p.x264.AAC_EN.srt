1
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:27,799
Thank you.

2
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,272
Howzat!

3
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,836
Well fielded!

4
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,831
Keep the pace up!

5
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,591
No running!

6
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,832
Colley!

7
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,992
Good Lord. Where do you imagine
this one's from?

8
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:08,356
By Jove. Those ears!

9
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:12,789
You think his mama used them
to hoist him out of his crib?

10
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:19,669
- Sir? Follow me to the Headmaster.
- Thank you.

11
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,318
Chipping?

12
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,675
We've never had a Chipping here.

13
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:29,880
Indeed, Headmaster?
It's Chipping as in Chipping Norton.

14
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,077
Or if you prefer, Chipping Camden.

15
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:37,948
I've never been to Chipping Norton
or to Chipping Camden.

16
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:41,271
Which, as you say, I may well prefer.

17
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,796
Now, the agency says
you're worth a second chance.

18
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:49,670
And here at Brookfield we believe
in giving the second chance.

19
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,512
Now...

20
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,558
The boys are, I warn you,

21
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,596
most energetic.

22
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,113
Most.

23
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:04,637
And if in your previous school
discipline proved a problem...?

24
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,951
- If I might explain...
- The fact is, Chipping,

25
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:12,033
our Latin master's gone,
came into a huge inheritance,

26
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,475
but there's still a month of term.

27
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,437
Ideal trial period!

28
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:21,196
We can always think again,
I mean, after that.

29
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,795
Can you take the Lower Fifth now?
Declensions, conjugations -

30
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:28,589
- no striving necessary.
- Yes. Thank you, Headmaster.

31
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,831
Thank you, Chipping,
we are rather desperate.

32
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:41,353
Ah, Rivers. Good man.

33
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:47,399
Mr Chipping is taking the Lower
Fifth. Would you show him there?

34
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,916
Yes, Headmaster.

35
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,390
We'll get you accustomed
to Brookfield's language

36
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:58,472
or you shan't know
what we're talking about.

37
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,269
A boy shan't ask for a glass of milk,
it's "a tot of dolly."

38
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:06,069
He mustn't wear "gutties" in dorm,
"gutties" are for cricket.

39
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:10,517
Nor can a boy wear his "pigs" in dorm
either - "pigs" are his boots.

40
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,239
Walk!

41
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:18,075
The Upper Third. Like all
young beasts they need restraint.

42
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,559
Ahh!

43
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:22,438
Henshaw, you burnt my toast again today.

44
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,476
Sorry, Rivers! I won't do it again!

45
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,154
That suggests you did it deliberately.

46
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:30,312
You should say,
"I shan't let it happen again."

47
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,198
I shan't let it happen again,
Rivers! Ow!

48
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,955
The standard of fagging this year
is deplorable.

49
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:50,069
This is Mr Chipping.
He will take you for Latin.

50
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,039
All the books you shall need -
in the drawer. Sir.

51
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,551
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

52
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,551
Good afternoon, sir.

53
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,755
Possum - I can.

54
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,308
Potes - you can.

55
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:36,074
Potest...

56
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:48,230
May I enquire as to the nature
of your unannounced recreation?

57
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:51,073
Please, sir, he's playing possum.

58
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:55,392
- "Playing possum"?
- Like opossum - the animal, sir.

59
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,789
He's pretending to be dead, sir.

60
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:00,235
Take 100 lines and resume your desk.

61
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:03,198
Sir, I can't, I hurt my arm when I fell.

62
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:07,029
200 lines, and sit, please.

63
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,271
Oh, I think... I feel ill

64
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,870
300 lines, after school,
in this classroom.

65
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,351
Ohh...

66
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,317
500 lines and sit!

67
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:32,119
- Oh, no, sir...
- Right!

68
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:35,715
Get back here!

69
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,556
Get back here, boy!

70
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,159
Go on, Colley, run!

71
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,676
Gentlemen!

72
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,109
Where is your honour?!

73
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:10,919
Is this the spirit of Brookfield?

74
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:18,030
From two o'clock tomorrow every boy
will come to my office for caning.

75
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:22,113
Alphabetical order,
one boy every five minutes.

76
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,557
Resume your books.

77
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:35,195
Er, the staff room, I think.

78
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,716
- Good afternoon.
- Afternoon.

79
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,596
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

80
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:04,559
- Burnley, Geography.
- Chipping, Latin.

81
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:07,234
- Glass of brandy?
- Thank you, no.

82
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,993
What was that row?

83
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,230
Shh.

84
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:17,117
Hello! I'm Staefel. I do German.

85
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,475
Chipping. I do Latin, I hope.

86
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,596
Was that your baptism of fire?

87
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,831
I say, if you're Latin
it's your night for Prep.

88
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:27,593
Ah, Metcalf, a change of plan.

89
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,468
- Could you possibly take Prep?
- Headmaster, please!

90
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:34,632
In the light of the scene
I just witnessed...

91
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:39,840
Headmaster, you've only just put
my name down. I should dearly hope...

92
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:46,313
A second chance, I believe you said,
Headmaster? That at Brookfield, er...

93
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:49,995
- Forgive me, I've already asked...
- Headmaster,

94
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,629
if the boys hear their behaviour
proved coercive...

95
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,795
Oh, very well. As you were.

96
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:03,116
- Metcalf.
- How do you do?

97
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,156
Hm.

98
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:15,196
They put a pigeon in my desk
on my first day.

99
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:17,236
Said it was a homing pigeon.

100
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,871
Called it Friedrich.

101
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,751
I do know how to teach.

102
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,950
You have some hours before Prep.

103
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:30,669
Go out, out there under the sky.
Look around.

104
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:35,595
What is the saying? "Distance lends
enchantment to the view."

105
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,750
Go out, come back refreshed.

106
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,751
Bravo!

107
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,990
- Bravo!
- Hard luck.

108
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,592
Seeking inspiration?

109
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,432
No, sir!

110
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,795
Henshaw, isn't it?

111
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,757
What are you doing?

112
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:11,435
Sir, a prefect gave me a ha'penny
to pay for an errand

113
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:16,196
and I've lost it, sir.
If I don't find it he'll thrash me.

114
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:19,636
Well, you should be more careful,
shouldn't you?

115
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,393
Henshaw?

116
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,435
Be more careful with that, hm?

117
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,351
Thank you, sir!

118
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:33,193
Howzat!

119
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,150
- Chater. Cherry.
- Yes, sir.

120
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,834
- Clarke. Cochrane.
- Yes, sir.

121
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:45,798
- Colley. Copeland.
- Yes, sir.

122
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:48,952
- Deverill. Dexter.
- Yes, sir.

123
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:32,918
Would the boy at the head of
the table behind me please stand up?

124
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:39,356
- Do you mean me, sir?
- I do, yes.

125
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,994
- What is your name?
- Colley, sir.

126
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,672
Colley?

127
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,115
Is not a "Colley" a dog?

128
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,919
When I was a boy
I had a dog of that breed.

129
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,956
His name was Rover.

130
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:58,594
Very well... Rover,

131
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:01,240
for slamming down your book twice

132
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:04,471
and denying other boys
their right to study,

133
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:08,997
you will stay behind, and in your
detention you will write 100 times,

134
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:11,275
"A dog will never behave like a boy

135
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,352
"but a boy
will sometimes behave like a dog."

136
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,476
In Latin.

137
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,711
I shall be interested
in your translation.

138
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:22,872
Well now, Rover... Sit!

139
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,270
Get a move on, you chaps!

140
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,112
Oh!

141
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,589
Go to it, hounds!

142
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:53,717
Bailey. Eastham. Bell. Watson.

143
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,756
Hope you're getting them all!

144
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:59,071
When you consider that
Metcalf is a housemaster

145
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:01,469
does one want to be a housemaster?

146
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,710
Pick those feet up, Brookfield men!

147
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:07,509
- Pick those feet up!
- Still, I should like to be asked.

148
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,955
So should I. Good, keep going!

149
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,951
Collins, well done.

150
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:20,475
But I shan't get it, I have become
philosophical about my ambition.

151
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:24,633
It makes me avoid disappointment.
Have we done?

152
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,473
Er, yes, I think so...
Oh, no, Alderdyce.

153
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,352
Oh!

154
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:36,837
That's enough.
Let's get you back, Alderdyce.

155
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:39,275
Please, sir, I want to run.

156
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,272
- Don't talk nonsense.
- Watch out.

157
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:45,716
Alderdyce!
Get back on the trail at once!

158
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,314
Chipping, what are you doing?

159
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:52,154
Oh, come on, he's been in
the sanatorium since Term Day.

160
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,390
Do not mollycoddle him!

161
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,870
Do you want him to be ill again?
No, this is not good.

162
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,518
Very well.

163
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:05,150
Alderdyce, be a milksop.
See how that will profit you.

164
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,356
Really, Metcalf!

165
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:11,312
- Come on, Alderdyce.
- Come on, boys!

166
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,197
Alderdyce is on holiday!

167
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:17,194
Fifteen minutes to full change, everyone!

168
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:19,157
Well done, Hounds.

169
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:22,391
Very well done.
Well done, Hare - where are you?

170
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,278
Jolly good trail. Well done.

171
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,828
- So well done everyone.
- Thanks.

172
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,990
Or nearly everyone.

173
00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:01,158
And expect Cicero. They're obsessed
with Cicero at Cambridge.

174
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,992
Yes, sir.

175
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:08,232
You should feel very confident,
Hawthorne,

176
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,756
I've not had a student
who prepared so thoroughly.

177
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,990
Come on, Hawthorne, what is it?

178
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:19,039
Sir, I've been a scholarship boy
at Brookfield

179
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:23,113
and been made to feel pretty low
on account of it.

180
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:26,510
Hawthorne, scholarships
honour the intellect.

181
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:31,993
Our bursaries here make Brookfield
very, very special to me.

182
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:37,191
But sir, everyone here knows
they only go to... to the unwealthy.

183
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:40,352
And everyone at Cambridge
will know that too.

184
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:45,309
Doesn't the quality of the mind
outweigh all social considerations?

185
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:49,439
When you graduate from Cambridge,
and you shall gain entry,

186
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:53,195
then I am certain you shall graduate
with distinction,

187
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:57,034
help whom you can
to use their minds well.

188
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,237
That will level the score, hm?

189
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:30,270
Ow! Get off!

190
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,839
Get off! Ow!

191
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,959
Ouch!

192
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:17,110
Cease this!

193
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:25,670
Now would be a good time
to feel ashamed, gentlemen.

194
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,115
Sir, this is our house initiation.

195
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,919
It's barbaric, Rinehart. Barbaric!

196
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,912
I've said so before
and I shall go on saying it

197
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,357
- until good behaviour supervenes.
- But, sir, I was barrelled.

198
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:42,638
Precisely! And it made you
a barbarian! Now get to your house!

199
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,953
- Alderdyce.
- Sir...

200
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,871
Come along.

201
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,831
Come on, come on!

202
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,672
Quietly!

203
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,071
Straight to bed.

204
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:34,396
What is this?
Chipping, what have you done now?

205
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:39,270
- Alderdyce, were you barrelled?
- Yes, sir.

206
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:43,990
You have to stay there until fetched.
Now you have to do it again.

207
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,514
Please, sir, it wasn't my fault, sir.

208
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,716
Alderdyce is innocent in this.

209
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:53,109
Alderdyce, go to bed.

210
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,589
Put some dry clothes on, Alderdyce.

211
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:59,311
Did you halt the barrelling?

212
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:02,870
- Interest omnium recte facere.
- Speak English!

213
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,315
It is for the good of all to do right.

214
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:08,551
I am Alderdyce's housemaster, not you!

215
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:22,940
Good luck, Hawthorne.

216
00:19:23,736 --> 00:19:24,986
Ah, Chipping.

217
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:30,928
Beastly this waiting, isn't it?
The housemaster thing.

218
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:32,772
Not for me.

219
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:36,216
I've no wish to spend every day
of every week, month, year, decade

220
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,609
mollycoddling the little beasts.

221
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:42,852
Can you imagine?
Runny noses, stomach aches - urgh!

222
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:45,932
Not for me,
I've told the headmaster as much.

223
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:48,409
- Oh?
- Oh, no, I didn't mean...

224
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:51,572
- It'd be quite the thing for you.
- Oh, no. Yes.

225
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:55,731
Hey! Give it back!

226
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:58,698
- Give it back!
- Over here!

227
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,691
It's not funny!

228
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:12,654
- Oh, no!
- We've lost that.

229
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:19,294
- What's going on?
- Someone's on the roof!

230
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:23,134
Come on, you're nearly there!

231
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:30,177
Oh, well done!

232
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:35,213
- Hang on, Sexton!
- Be careful!

233
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:48,195
Sexton!

234
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:56,992
- He's safe, sir.
- Well, fetch a ladder! Quickly!

235
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:02,270
Sexton! Are you all right?

236
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:06,916
- Yes!
- Hold still! Do not move a muscle!

237
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,956
Sexton, hold on!

238
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,157
Here! What is going on?

239
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,754
A patch of misdemeanour, Headmaster.

240
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:22,549
A boater, a roof
and a boy who ought to know better.

241
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:27,031
Address it, would you, Mr Chipping?
I shall want to know.

242
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,872
Headmaster.

243
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:34,114
Main prep room, Sexton. Ten minutes.

244
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,191
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

245
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,758
Come!

246
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:49,755
Close the door, Sexton.

247
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:56,958
Come and stand in front of me.
Put your boater down.

248
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:02,235
Raise both arms and hold them out
with the palm upward.

249
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:11,109
Now, it is a distinct contravention
of Brookfield rubric to climb a roof.

250
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,510
Why, Sexton?
Because danger lies inherent.

251
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:19,071
Therefore I must address
this wilful misdemeanour of yours.

252
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,750
You heard the Headmaster, hm?

253
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,672
Very well.

254
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,756
Get out, Sexton.

255
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,197
Thank you, sir.

256
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,273
Sir!

257
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,159
Sir...

258
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:12,159
I'm in! Cambridge has accepted me.

259
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,879
- I'm in.
- Oh, well done, Hawthorne.

260
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:19,909
- That's wonderful news. Well done!
- No, sir, well done to you.

261
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,312
In life there are matters of
character and matters of behaviour.

262
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:28,279
Passing that examination
was a matter of good character.

263
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:30,749
Highest praise, Hawthorne.

264
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:33,400
Er, come in!

265
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:38,430
- You sent for me, Headmaster?
- Ah, yes, Chipping.

266
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:40,476
Do sit down.

267
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:53,193
I sent for you regarding the position
of the new housemaster.

268
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:57,671
- Yes, Headmaster.
- It's a position of some gravity.

269
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:01,878
The position requires
an egregious range of values.

270
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:05,919
Duties in a house extend
far beyond those of a classroom.

271
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,232
A different dedication,
a redirected perception and so forth.

272
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:13,278
You do not, I feel sure,
require a recital.

273
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:18,878
Indeed, I find myself so in agreement
that a recital would be superfluous.

274
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:22,873
Good, I'm grateful.
So, bearing in mind all things,

275
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:26,111
I've offered the position to Staefel.

276
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:32,516
Yes, Headmaster. An excellent choice.

277
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:34,989
Thank you, Chipping.

278
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:40,156
That will be all, Chipping.

279
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:43,676
Headmaster, may I enquire as to why...?

280
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:47,833
I mean, so to speak,
why I was not chosen?

281
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,512
Oh...

282
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:53,837
Do you know, Chipping, I sometimes think

283
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:58,948
that giving reasons for one's actions
is a rather futile gesture.

284
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:01,713
You do understand what I mean, don't you?

285
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:05,553
Yes, Headmaster. Thank you.

286
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:17,792
Come on!

287
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:30,917
Alderdyce! Alderdyce, come here!

288
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:39,075
I haven't seen you since your ordeal.

289
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:42,390
How are you?

290
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:47,116
- You going home for the hols?
- Please, sir...

291
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,668
Come on, Alderdyce - race you!

292
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:55,269
I wish I were going with you.
You will be careful?

293
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:59,433
I must avoid being careful, Max,
it has availed me little.

294
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:03,433
Nor, if I'm truthful,
has being careless proven useful.

295
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:07,513
If you were my housemaster,
how would you now advise me?

296
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,158
Goodbye, sir.

297
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:14,518
When I stopped judging myself harshly
the world was kinder to me.

298
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:18,309
Remember I told you once,
go out, look around the world?

299
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:21,870
Do that now, only this time
let the world look at you.

300
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:25,794
My friend, I assure you,
the world will like what it sees.

301
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,677
Cheerio, Max.

302
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:11,232
Madam? Is everything in order?

303
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:12,719
Hm?

304
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:15,997
You appear to be in a position
of possible peril.

305
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,594
Um, no peril, thank you.

306
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:25,119
- Do you know why I'm up here?
- I don't.

307
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,952
It's my vantage point.

308
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:32,789
You see, from up here
I can see the fish perfectly.

309
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:38,758
Fish are so much more visible
when viewed from above.

310
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:42,276
Indeed, there have been murmurs
to this effect.

311
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,874
Oh! Oh!

312
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:51,190
Hold on!

313
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,831
Keep quite still.

314
00:27:57,680 --> 00:28:01,514
Now, steady. That's it,
I've got you. Just fall.

315
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,078
Thank you.

316
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:11,355
- Are you all right?
- I am now.

317
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,877
Thank you.

318
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:22,111
Who are you?

319
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:25,636
Oh, just... someone on holiday.
Nobody really.

320
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:31,674
Nobody's nobody.
Or is nobody actually your name?

321
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:34,194
Richard Nobody? David Nobody?

322
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:36,236
Actually my name is Chipping.

323
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:41,913
I was with a walking party
but... I escaped.

324
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,039
They didn't want
to look at the fish, I did.

325
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,793
What are you, Mr Chipping?
A solicitor?

326
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:54,917
- No.
- Are you a stockbroker?

327
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,231
- A dentist?
- No, not a stockbroker.

328
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,197
Nor a dentist.

329
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:02,555
Not a stockbroker, not a dentist.

330
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,950
Are you a man with a cotton business
in Manchester?

331
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:08,838
No, er... I'm a teacher, I hope.

332
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:10,990
Oh, how wonderful!

333
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:13,389
Shelter, perhaps?

334
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,555
- Here, in here.
- Oh!

335
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,437
Good heavens!

336
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:31,593
Oh, here. I have a cape.

337
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,471
Oh, thank you.

338
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,992
Thank you.

339
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:44,390
Do you know, a teacher is
the very best thing to be!

340
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,436
Well, I used to think so.

341
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:48,875
Oh, yes.

342
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:51,679
Think of the wonderful gifts you give.

343
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,034
"Gifts"?

344
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:58,240
Think of the gift you gave when you
told someone where Mesopotamia is.

345
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:01,312
Or you taught someone
the length of the Nile.

346
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,994
- I am Latin, not geography.
- Well...

347
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:07,755
Think of the gift you give
when you teach someone Cicero.

348
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:10,035
Or Lucretius.

349
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:15,677
Do you truly think teaching's like this?

350
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,192
Truly.

351
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,836
It's terribly important.

352
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:23,593
It is the most important thing there is.

353
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:26,511
- Madam...
- I'm not madam,

354
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:30,957
I'm Katherine Bridges and everyone
calls me Kathie, Mr Chipping.

355
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:35,429
"Mr Chipping". I expect
your pupils call you "Chips".

356
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:38,239
No, I don't believe they call me that.

357
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:41,517
Well, I shall. How do you, Mr Chips?

358
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:55,914
...quite categorically.

359
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,560
- Is that your walking party?
- Oh.

360
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,631
Come along now!

361
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,597
There they are.

362
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:34,519
Good evening! I hope
you've something tasty for dinner.

363
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:37,353
We've a hearty set of appetites,
I promise you.

364
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,271
You're very lucky,

365
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:43,672
most of our rooms are booked
well in advance at this time of year.

366
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:47,878
Room 22. And do not
smoke your pipe in the bath.

367
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:58,998
Ah, the celebrated Maud - that's
very convenient. I wonder if...?

368
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,190
Ah, the pianist!

369
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:10,550
I'm sorry, nobody wants to play.

370
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,995
They're having a soiree, they say.

371
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:15,355
We can't play with three.

372
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,793
Oh!

373
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:23,354
Excuse me.
Forgive my intrusion but...

374
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,829
could you bear to make up a four?

375
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:28,559
How kind. I'd be delighted.

376
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:34,316
- I'm not very good, I'm afraid.
- Neither are we so that's splendid.

377
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:44,389
Um... Would you mind most awfully
if I sat in that chair?

378
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:47,756
- Oh... No.
- Thank you. Thank you.

Shh! Listen.

400
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:47,336
- Morning.
- Morning, sir.

401
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:01,096
Oh, good morning.

402
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:03,171
- Hello!
- I didn't know...

403
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:06,650
- Are you staying...?
- Yes, I am. It's very pleasant.

404
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:09,577
Well, you are up early.

405
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:12,174
- Much to do, Miss Bridges.
- Kathie.

406
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:15,568
- Kathie.
- Yes?

407
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:17,935
No, I was just repeating your name.

408
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:23,009
What is your "much to do", Mr Chips?

409
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:26,536
Oh, I'd heard there were
some ruins nearby.

410
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:28,576
You mean my walking party?

411
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:36,932
Well, I wondered if...
Is it possible... Could you join me?

412
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:41,969
It's not very interesting and I'm
dull company - dry as dust, I fear.

413
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:44,858
I shall join you. I shall sweep off!

414
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:47,090
Do you bicycle?

415
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:51,496
Careful.

416
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:55,253
- Don't look down.
- Don't look down?

417
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:58,730
I'm looking straight ahead,
does that help?

418
00:35:58,820 --> 00:36:02,859
Oh! It's almost fun.

419
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:07,251
- Watch that...
- Whoa!

420
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:10,976
Take care!

421
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:55,854
Yes, don't you think if you had a wife

422
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:59,649
you would respect her enough
to believe she could vote?

423
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:03,779
But women have never voted.
I fear we're too late for supper.

424
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:07,978
- I'm most awfully sorry.
- Women have a right to be doctors.

425
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:12,451
- I hope you're not too hungry.
- Oh, do stop changing the subject!

426
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:14,576
Women would make good doctors.

427
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:16,616
We're wonderful healers.

428
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:18,736
And we civilise matters.

429
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:22,096
Well, yes, I suppose,
if you put it like that, yes.

430
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:26,854
Do you like Mr George Bernard Shaw?

431
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:31,058
I have never asked myself that
question but the answer is no.

432
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:33,096
But he says wonderful things.

433
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:35,296
He says very unsettling things.

434
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:37,769
Like women should be allowed to vote?

435
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:44,356
Thank you for a wonderful day.

436
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:49,116
Oh, to the contrary, thank you for
making such a wonderful companion.

437
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:55,552
Good night.

438
00:37:55,640 --> 00:38:00,839
If we were to, um...
Well, I mean, were we to meet...

439
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:04,390
Let us shake hands.
Like we did before.

440
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,835
You know I leave tomorrow?

441
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:13,311
Katherine, the train leaves
at twenty past seven, remember.

442
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:17,112
I'd no idea.

443
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:23,996
Do come and bid me goodbye.

444
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:45,390
- Morning, my dear.
- Morning.

445
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:47,436
Come along, time to be off!

446
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:01,476
Katherine?

447
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:28,319
Blast!

448
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:35,715
Mr Chipping!

449
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:39,793
Miss Bridges has just left.
She asked me to give you this.

450
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,756
Would you mind? Thank you.

451
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:47,554
Whoa!

452
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:51,399
- Good heavens!
- Gracious!

453
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:53,958
Good morning!

454
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:03,638
Extraordinary!
What is the fellow doing?

455
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:13,391
Good heavens.

456
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:16,392
I hope you're not going to
forget yourself?

457
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:18,436
I believe I already have.

458
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,631
Well, I never.

459
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,471
Walk on.

460
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:34,792
Your bag!

461
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:28,818
Have you heard?
Chipping's got married!

462
00:42:32,540 --> 00:42:34,849
That must be her.

463
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:54,650
Did he tell you, Staefel?

464
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:56,696
No, but I'd say, "Well done."

465
00:42:56,780 --> 00:43:01,012
Imagine what she must look like.
I mean, marrying Chipping?

466
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:04,136
Oh, good!

467
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:11,018
Gentlemen, may I introduce
my wife, Katherine?

468
00:43:17,540 --> 00:43:20,134
- Welcome, Mrs Chipping.
- Max Staefel.

469
00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:22,415
- Well done, old boy.
- Thank you.

470
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:25,060
- Congratulations.
- Metcalf.

471
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:28,453
Exquisite!

472
00:43:28,540 --> 00:43:30,735
Hold that - carefully.

473
00:43:32,460 --> 00:43:34,655
Wonderful, wonderful.

474
00:43:35,580 --> 00:43:38,811
Now, you must be
the photography club, hello.

475
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:41,733
What is the Latin term for "dark horse"?

476
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:46,409
I told you, my friend,
the world would like what it saw.

477
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:48,377
She is adorable.

478
00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:51,975
Oh, Mrs Chipping, come.

479
00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:55,336
You must all come to tea. All of you.

480
00:43:55,420 --> 00:43:57,376
And you, Herr Staefel.

481
00:44:01,660 --> 00:44:03,571
Now one of me.

482
00:44:04,540 --> 00:44:08,010
The chronicles of the Romans in Britain

483
00:44:08,100 --> 00:44:11,729
were written by a scribe
with first-hand experience.

484
00:44:11,820 --> 00:44:13,776
To whom do I refer?

485
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:16,818
- Yes, Colley.
- Sir, it was Tacitus.

486
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:20,449
Indeed, it was.
Who was Tacitus's father-in-law?

487
00:44:20,540 --> 00:44:24,692
And Colley, please do not say,
"Well, sir, it wasn't me."

488
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:28,616
It was Agricola, sir.

489
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:30,611
Very gratifying, Colley.

490
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:34,898
I hope you will impart this
to your brother - I failed to do so.

491
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:36,936
Good morning, Headmaster.

492
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:40,615
- Morning, Headmaster.
- Morning, gentlemen.

493
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:43,658
Letting some fresh air
into the classroom?

494
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:46,812
- Yes, it was my wife's idea.
- Jolly good idea.

495
00:44:46,900 --> 00:44:50,779
- Is she settling in?
- Very much so, sir. Still exploring.

496
00:44:50,860 --> 00:44:53,897
I'd like to find something
for her to do here.

497
00:44:53,980 --> 00:44:56,414
You'll find her most receptive, sir.

498
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:03,179
Gentlemen, dismissed!
Quietly, please. Festina lente.

499
00:45:03,260 --> 00:45:05,376
Colley, translate, please.

500
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:10,250
- Er, hasten slowly, sir.
- As words to deeds, Colley!

501
00:45:20,940 --> 00:45:24,455
I'll give you something
to really blub about.

502
00:45:24,540 --> 00:45:28,055
- Come on.
- Stop it, Wallingford!

503
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:31,150
- What are you doing?
- Chipping's coming!

504
00:45:31,220 --> 00:45:33,873
Here you are, Rushton. Good boy.

505
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:39,431
Now, Anthony, I shall be very gentle.

506
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:40,873
Hm?

507
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:49,519
Rushton, is there anything
you might have done

508
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:53,798
to make Wallingford think
you had provoked him in this action?

509
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:58,192
Please, sir, my mother has died
and I was blubbing, sir.

510
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:04,278
Thank you.

511
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:08,793
Chips, this is frightful!

512
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:12,236
Why does this boy Wallingford
do this sort of thing?

513
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:14,276
Are you going to cane him?

514
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:16,316
I don't know.

515
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:50,556
Sit down.

516
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:01,954
What is your model in all this?

517
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:06,238
What - or who - convinces you

518
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:09,278
that this is
the behaviour of a gentleman?

519
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:16,118
Wallingford, I shall be seeing
the Headmaster this evening.

520
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:18,475
He may wish to expel you.

521
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:43,988
The Headmaster likes to sit
with his elbows on the table.

522
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:46,469
So we allow him room to do so?

523
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:50,997
No, Mrs Wetherby doesn't like him
to have his elbows on the table.

524
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:55,756
So as ever you have to judge
how far he wishes to take the matter.

525
00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:02,398
Therefore... we leave him room enough
to take the decision should he wish.

526
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:14,317
- Soup is the most natural food.
- Oh, Max!

527
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:19,315
I believe it. It returns us
to the point whence we sprang.

528
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:21,960
- Mr Darwin says...
- Not him again.

529
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:26,079
Mr Darwin says we all rose
from a kind of primitive soup,

530
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:29,550
with all the ingredients
that make Man what he is.

531
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:32,837
Not too much salt, I trust?

532
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:36,879
Mrs Chipping, I hope you did not
encounter Mr Darwin's soup

533
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:40,555
in your education,
which I gather was a private one?

534
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:42,995
Two governesses, Headmaster.

535
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:46,755
- Miss Flint and Miss Steel.
- Most promising names.

536
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:48,319
Thank you.

537
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:52,039
As for... school life,

538
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:56,318
I find some of it
quite surprising, Headmaster.

539
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:57,958
Oh?

540
00:48:58,040 --> 00:49:00,759
My husband and I...

541
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:02,796
we loathe bullying.

542
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:12,912
Some theorists suggest
that a great school like this

543
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:16,879
should mirror the world
the boys will encounter outside.

544
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:21,875
But... bullying is uncivilised
is it not, Headmaster?

545
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:26,238
Mrs Chipping, I find the idea
of private education intriguing.

546
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:30,836
Your governesses, were they
generalists teaching all subjects

547
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:33,070
or did they specialise?

548
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:36,516
Headmaster, forgive me,
I saw poor Rushton.

549
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:38,716
I saw him this afternoon.

550
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:42,640
Rushton? Enlighten me.

551
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:45,075
He had been most horribly bullied.

552
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:49,711
A great school like Brookfield
needs a number of hierarchies,

553
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:52,837
it helps keep order.
It's why we have prefects.

554
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:55,115
Max, he was in a dreadful state

555
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:58,351
and all because his bullies
found him weeping.

556
00:49:58,440 --> 00:50:00,954
Rushton's mother had just died

557
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:04,555
and the poor boy
was being bullied for grieving.

558
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:06,995
That is unconscionable.

559
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:11,954
- Do we know the culprit?
- Wallingford, Headmaster.

560
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:15,191
I trust you caned him,
and jolly severely.

561
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:18,556
- No, Headmaster.
- Why ever not?!

562
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:24,835
It... hasn't worked in the past,
not with Wallingford, anyway.

563
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:28,354
Nor anyone else, really.

564
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:36,713
I feel he must be a deeply unhappy child.

565
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:40,759
No, Wallingford has behaved
appallingly since he came here.

566
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:44,230
If you can't punish him, Chipping, I can.

567
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:49,390
Headmaster, may I suggest
this is the wrong action?

568
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:52,199
- The point is...
- There must be

569
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:57,035
some means of... well,
altering Wallingford's behaviour?

570
00:50:57,120 --> 00:51:00,874
I do think, Mrs Chipping,
that the running of the school

571
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:04,032
ought to be undertaken
by the teaching staff.

572
00:51:12,660 --> 00:51:17,176
Headmaster, do you know the fable
of the Sun and the North Wind?

573
00:51:17,260 --> 00:51:19,615
The Sun and North Wind were arguing

574
00:51:19,700 --> 00:51:22,055
as to who had the greatest powers.

575
00:51:22,140 --> 00:51:24,779
"Observe that man," said the North Wind,

576
00:51:24,860 --> 00:51:27,693
"I shall blow his coat
from his shoulders."

577
00:51:27,780 --> 00:51:29,611
So the North Wind blew

578
00:51:29,700 --> 00:51:34,376
but the man simply wrapped his coat
even tighter round his shoulders.

579
00:51:34,460 --> 00:51:37,338
And then the Sun, gently, said,

580
00:51:37,420 --> 00:51:39,775
"You've had your opportunity,

581
00:51:41,580 --> 00:51:44,253
"please, allow me."

582
00:51:45,980 --> 00:51:48,016
And the Sun shone,

583
00:51:48,100 --> 00:51:53,891
warmer and warmer...
and the man took off his coat.

584
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:02,554
Good night!

585
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:13,394
Oh, Chips, have I ruined everything?

586
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:16,552
Oh, now, none of that,
of course you haven't.

587
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:19,200
I had something so good to tell you.

588
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:21,879
What?

589
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:25,396
You're going to become...
something else.

590
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:28,837
Something new.

591
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:34,278
Oh, well... what more do I want to be?
I'm a Latin teacher and a husband...

592
00:52:36,040 --> 00:52:37,632
Think.

593
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:40,836
No!

594
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:42,876
- Really?
- Mm-hm.

595
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:45,269
- Are you certain?
- Mm-hm.

596
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:47,430
Oh, my word!

597
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:53,716
Oh, well done!

598
00:52:58,600 --> 00:53:01,672
- Good morning, Mrs Chipping.
- Good morning.

599
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:10,236
- Wallingford?
- Good morning, Mrs Chipping.

600
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:12,356
Could I have a word with you?

601
00:53:20,360 --> 00:53:22,271
It's ready!

602
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:25,953
Would you take some of this
round to Chips?

603
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:30,636
Like this?
That's it. Very good.

604
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:35,631
Why, thank you.

605
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:40,833
- Let me give you a hand.
- Thanks.

606
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:04,517
Gentlemen, I shan't keep you a moment.

607
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:06,636
Er, Mrs Chipping has proposed

608
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:10,429
that we invite some... girls
from Meadowland Academy

609
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:12,556
er, for a social evening.

610
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:15,916
I find the idea
rather progressive for my taste

611
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:19,310
- but perhaps it has aspects...
- Headmaster...

612
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:23,951
I don't want to stand in the way of
progress but this is a boys' school.

613
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:27,749
And furthermore,
the school is run by teachers...

614
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:30,991
under your guidance.

615
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:34,470
Headmaster, in France,
boys at a school like this

616
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:38,792
are encouraged towards social skills.
They're even taught to dance.

617
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:41,474
Well, happily we are not in France.

618
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:45,519
One, two, three, four.

619
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:48,717
And turn -
imagine Jonathan's a young lady.

620
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:52,236
- Chips, will you help demonstrate?
- By all means.

621
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:55,915
Always turn inwards,
in towards your partner.

622
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,353
Madam.

623
00:54:58,560 --> 00:55:00,312
Thank you, Max.

624
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:02,914
Chins up!

625
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:07,676
One, two, three, four, turn in.

626
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:19,636
Now, remember, you are young gentlemen.

627
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:22,837
You must uphold
the reputation of this house.

628
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:33,276
Miss Robbins.

629
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:35,237
Good evening.

630
00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:37,151

I want you to run Wellington House -
with Mrs Chipping, of course.

669
00:57:58,520 --> 00:58:02,069
An essential cog
in the Brookfield machine now.

670
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:06,358
- Thank you, Headmaster.
- My congratulations, Mrs Chipping.

671
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:09,796
The Sun again has triumphed
over the North Wind.

Oh, thank you, Headmaster.

very special.

00:58:16,280 --> 00:58:18,669
Wellington? Oh, Chips!

675
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:20,113
Yes!

676
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:23,158
- Miss Johnson.
- Thank you, Headmaster,

677
00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:27,597
for allowing us the pleasure
of meeting such well-mannered boys.

678
00:58:29,560 --> 00:58:33,109
The Headmaster has charged us

Congratulations, Chips!
Congratulations, Kathie!

680
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:44,517
You will also observe how Latin
informs you in other disciplines.

681
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:47,717
For example, who has not yet heard of

682
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:51,509
the geometry theorem
we call Pons Asinorum -

683
00:58:51,600 --> 00:58:54,672
"the bridge... of donkeys"?

684
00:58:57,640 --> 00:59:01,349
We call it this... because it is...

685
00:59:05,160 --> 00:59:10,951
a bridge of learning
at which so many donkeys falter.

686
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:14,234
Second door on the left, please.

687
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:16,197
Would you both like tea?

688
00:59:16,280 --> 00:59:18,236
Yes, please, ma'am.

689
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:25,713
- Oh, my dear, let me...
- I'm all right.

690
00:59:27,560 --> 00:59:30,199
I had no idea you had so many books.

691
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:33,191
You gave me that one.

692
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:38,791
We could call him Albert.

693
00:59:40,080 --> 00:59:42,036
Yes, or Victoria.

694
00:59:43,560 --> 00:59:45,516
- Or Edward.
- Or Edwina.

695
00:59:46,560 --> 00:59:50,519
Alice!
I rather like Leopold.

696
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:54,596
We shall be fine.

697
00:59:54,680 --> 00:59:57,638
Don't worry, I'll tell you the good news.

698
00:59:57,720 --> 01:00:01,395
Yes. Thank you. Thank you, Doctor.

699
01:00:36,840 --> 01:00:38,273
Doctor?

700
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:42,673
- Victoria or Albert?
- My dear fellow...

701
01:00:42,760 --> 01:00:45,718
- Boy or a girl?
- There were complications.

702
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:47,995
My wife is very straightforward.

703
01:00:48,080 --> 01:00:49,433
No.

704
01:00:50,920 --> 01:00:53,388
- No?
- I'm sorry.

705
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:56,595
Mrs Chipping did not survive.

706
01:00:56,680 --> 01:01:00,958
We tried to save both, we saved neither.

707
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:06,273
My wife is a very heavy sleeper,
we joke...

708
01:01:06,360 --> 01:01:08,828
My dear fellow! Not just yet.

709
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:29,234
And... the child, hm?

710
01:01:30,320 --> 01:01:32,709
It would have been Albert.

711
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:03,350
He's coming! Hurry!

712
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:06,318
When he looks up
show the April Fool sign.

713
01:02:12,800 --> 01:02:14,711
Quick, hide it!

714
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:21,472
- Good morning, sir.
- Morning.

715
01:02:21,560 --> 01:02:26,588
Er, today, gentlemen, we will return
to the familiar territory

716
01:02:26,680 --> 01:02:29,319
- of the Gallic Wars.
- Please, sir...

717
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:31,516
- We shall...
- Please, sir.

718
01:02:31,600 --> 01:02:35,115
You've received rather a lot
of letters, sir.

719
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:46,794
Er, book two, from the beginning.
Who shall volunteer?

720
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,514
"When Caesar was in yonder Gaul..."

721
01:02:54,600 --> 01:02:56,511
Hither. Hither Gaul.

722
01:02:57,760 --> 01:03:01,036
"In Hither Gaul,
in winter quarters..."

723
01:03:02,560 --> 01:03:04,471
Sorry I'm late, sir.

724
01:03:06,120 --> 01:03:07,951
"Frequent... rumours..."

725
01:03:08,040 --> 01:03:10,634
"..were brought to him

726
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:14,474
"and he was also informed
by letters from Labienus

727
01:03:14,560 --> 01:03:16,710
"that all the Belgae,
who have said..."

728
01:03:16,800 --> 01:03:20,349
- Mrs Chipping's dead.
- "..are a third..."

729
01:03:22,280 --> 01:03:24,555
- "..part..."
- Dead?

730
01:04:19,580 --> 01:04:24,813
Mr Ralston?! Welcome, welcome. We
were not expecting you until later.

731
01:04:24,900 --> 01:04:27,209
- And you are?
- Chipping. I...

732
01:04:27,300 --> 01:04:29,256
- Latin.
- Indeed, Headmaster.

733
01:04:29,340 --> 01:04:31,058
Long-serving, I believe?

734
01:04:31,140 --> 01:04:34,894
Therefore an excellent guide
for my tour of the school.

735
01:04:34,980 --> 01:04:38,370
Ah... Oh, yes.

736
01:04:39,460 --> 01:04:42,611
Don't look so depressed!

737
01:04:50,420 --> 01:04:53,332
This must be Herr... Steefel... Stifle?

738
01:04:53,420 --> 01:04:55,456
Staefel. Max Staefel.

739
01:04:55,540 --> 01:04:58,850
- How long has he been here?
- A wonderful teacher and collegue.

740
01:04:58,940 --> 01:05:02,858
Came here straight from Oxford.
Never taught anywhere else.

741
01:05:03,540 --> 01:05:07,695
Am I right that Brookfield does not
field an Officer Training Corps?

742
01:05:07,780 --> 01:05:12,058
We're trying to keep violence
out of the school, not bring it in.

743
01:05:18,780 --> 01:05:22,739
I would remind our Latin master
that German is a living language.

744
01:05:22,820 --> 01:05:27,291
Which, of course, to many of us
remains its chief problem.

745
01:05:27,380 --> 01:05:30,133
Is our esteemed chairman in this debate

746
01:05:30,220 --> 01:05:34,418
aligning himself too closely
with the traditions he teaches?

747
01:05:34,500 --> 01:05:37,776
After all, the Romans
believed in dictatorship

748
01:05:37,860 --> 01:05:40,932
and in the opposing of belief and opinion

749
01:05:41,020 --> 01:05:43,580
under the guise of impartiality!

750
01:06:05,140 --> 01:06:07,813
Gentlemen, I shall be brief.

751
01:06:08,100 --> 01:06:13,333
I've spent the last few days touching
the very fabric of Brookfield.

752
01:06:13,520 --> 01:06:17,798
I regret to have to tell you
I find the fabric somewhat frayed.

753
01:06:17,880 --> 01:06:22,635
We shall have some economies.
Stringent economies.

754
01:06:22,720 --> 01:06:25,393
Perhaps merge a house or two.

755
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:29,916
We must all understand
that Brookfield is a school,

756
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:31,797
not a charity.

757
01:06:31,880 --> 01:06:36,431
As of next term our fees will rise -
substantially.

758
01:06:36,520 --> 01:06:40,115
And we need to go out and persuade
people of, dare I say it,

759
01:06:40,200 --> 01:06:41,997
newly substantial means

760
01:06:42,080 --> 01:06:45,914
that their boys will profit
from attending Brookfield.

761
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:49,470
With this in mind
the curriculum will be modernised

762
01:06:49,560 --> 01:06:53,519
to meet the needs of such,
shall we say, practical parents.

763
01:06:53,600 --> 01:06:58,833
Therefore, gentlemen, change
all round. That's all for the moment.

764
01:06:58,920 --> 01:07:03,072
Er, Headmaster, Brookfield has
an honourable tradition

765
01:07:03,160 --> 01:07:05,993
of bursaries for boys of humbler means...

766
01:07:06,080 --> 01:07:08,878
Indeed it does. Thank you, gentlemen.

767
01:07:08,960 --> 01:07:10,916
My report will be circulated.

768
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,958
In the meantime, my door is always open.

769
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:23,634
Wetherby visited the staff room often.

770
01:07:23,720 --> 01:07:27,315
Mr Ralston has been once in two months!

771
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:31,631
What on earth?

772
01:07:35,640 --> 01:07:38,791
We shall deflect
previous forms of expenditure

773
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:42,395
into buildings for new disciplines -
science, sport - the future.

774
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:45,313
That's all very well, Mr Ralston...

775
01:07:48,200 --> 01:07:50,156
Fix bayonets!

776
01:07:50,240 --> 01:07:53,277
The target will not be sitting, waiting,

777
01:07:53,360 --> 01:07:56,238
he will run at you or away from you.

778
01:07:57,280 --> 01:07:59,191
Troop! Bayonets at the ready!

779
01:08:00,280 --> 01:08:02,635
By the right, quick march!

780
01:08:04,120 --> 01:08:06,190
On stride! Charge!

781
01:08:10,080 --> 01:08:11,832
Evans!

782
01:08:15,160 --> 01:08:18,436
Highcroft! Discipline this idiot!

783
01:08:18,520 --> 01:08:20,715
Sorry, sir. Evans, fall in!

784
01:08:21,800 --> 01:08:24,758
That was beyond impertinence!

785
01:08:24,840 --> 01:08:26,592
Yes, sir.

786
01:08:31,200 --> 01:08:33,111
Slowly, boys, slowly.

787
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,798
One moment, please!

788
01:08:56,400 --> 01:08:58,152
Come!

789
01:09:00,200 --> 01:09:03,431
Headmaster, I wish, if possible,
to have a word.

790
01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:06,239
Actually, I was wishing a word with you.

791
01:09:06,320 --> 01:09:08,470
- Do come in.
- Certainly.

792
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:19,549
He said he had Brookfield's
best interests at heart.

793
01:09:19,640 --> 01:09:23,838
"Must look around to see what is
happening in the wider world.

794
01:09:23,920 --> 01:09:25,751
"Climate of opinion."

795
01:09:26,680 --> 01:09:28,432
Chips...

796
01:09:29,480 --> 01:09:32,278
he more or less asked me to resign.

797
01:09:36,760 --> 01:09:39,672
- And did you?
- Of course.

798
01:09:39,760 --> 01:09:44,197
I'm alarmed... dismayed...
but I'm not surprised.

799
01:09:44,280 --> 01:09:46,475
What do you mean?

800
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:47,660
You must have divined

801
01:09:47,680 --> 01:09:51,080
that I and the subject I teach have
fallen from grace in England.

802
01:09:51,238 --> 01:09:52,838
You mustn't think like that!

803
01:09:54,320 --> 01:09:57,278
And Brookfield must not be like that.

804
01:09:58,360 --> 01:10:00,954
The King himself is of German descent!

805
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:03,956
There's going to be a war.

806
01:10:04,040 --> 01:10:06,429
None of us can help such things.

807
01:10:15,200 --> 01:10:16,952
Morning, Chipping.

808
01:10:18,040 --> 01:10:20,793
Max Staefel must not be allowed to leave.

809
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:23,713
- Is this your concern?
- This is monstrous!

810
01:10:23,800 --> 01:10:27,509
You dismiss a fine teacher
on the grounds of prejudice!

811
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:30,319
Herr Staefel offered his resignation.

812
01:10:30,400 --> 01:10:32,630
Under appalling moral pressure!

813
01:10:32,720 --> 01:10:36,554
You admit his position is difficult -
boys will be boys.

814
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:40,633
An English public school
has a duty to foster patriotism.

815
01:10:40,720 --> 01:10:43,712
- Would you not agree?
- This school is above...

816
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:48,237
Herr Staefel at least realises
that if there is a war with Germany

817
01:10:48,320 --> 01:10:50,834
his position will be intolerable.

818
01:10:56,720 --> 01:10:58,950
Anything else?

819
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:09,990
For those of us...

820
01:11:10,080 --> 01:11:14,756
like Max Staefel and myself, who have
devoted our lives to Brookfield,

821
01:11:14,840 --> 01:11:17,593
your record thus far is disgraceful.

822
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:20,596
"Disgraceful"?

823
01:11:20,680 --> 01:11:23,478
Do enlighten me, Chipping.

824
01:11:23,560 --> 01:11:25,516
I have asked you more than once

825
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:29,673
how many scholarship students
we may expect this year,

826
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:34,436
I have received no answer. I suspect
you mean to cancel the bursaries.

827
01:11:34,520 --> 01:11:39,355
I can tell you myself, I'm obliged
by the governors to make economies.

828
01:11:39,440 --> 01:11:40,793
Headmaster!

829
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:45,954
At Brookfield boys of lesser means
are given a wonderful chance!

830
01:11:46,040 --> 01:11:50,511
Why are you destroying this?!
This is monstrous!

831
01:11:58,360 --> 01:12:00,316
How old are you, Chipping?

832
01:12:01,400 --> 01:12:04,631
I have no wish nor any need to retire.

833
01:12:04,720 --> 01:12:09,271
- I may not see it that way.
- I beg your pardon?

834
01:12:10,920 --> 01:12:12,911
It seems to me, Headmaster,

835
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:17,471
that you do not possess the capacity
to understand or respect

836
01:12:17,560 --> 01:12:21,314
the qualities inherent
in a school such as Brookfield!

837
01:12:21,400 --> 01:12:23,994
Are you trying to provoke me, Chipping?

838
01:12:24,080 --> 01:12:26,833
I am charged with modernising Brookfield.

839
01:12:26,920 --> 01:12:32,119
We cannot adhere to styles
of education from the last century!

840
01:12:32,200 --> 01:12:35,909
You do not understand them.
I find them most effective.

841
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,070
Not in the new Brookfield.

842
01:12:38,160 --> 01:12:42,392
Sir, must all your movement be
towards the lowering of standards?!

843
01:12:42,480 --> 01:12:44,994
This is intolerable!

844
01:12:45,080 --> 01:12:47,548
I disagree with you profoundly

845
01:12:47,640 --> 01:12:51,189
and I do not see that
I can continue to serve under you.

846
01:12:56,720 --> 01:13:00,235
In that alone, Chipping,
we are of one mind.

847
01:13:05,400 --> 01:13:08,073
Yes, boys, I'm as upset as you are!

848
01:13:08,160 --> 01:13:11,914
But we've got to think of a plan.
We must have a plan!

849
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:13,956
Do we want Chips?

850
01:13:16,280 --> 01:13:19,078
- Do we rally?!
- Yes, we rally!

851
01:13:19,160 --> 01:13:21,594
Yes, we rally! Yes, we rally!

852
01:13:21,680 --> 01:13:24,911
- Are we ready?!
- Yes, we're ready!

853
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:29,710
Yes, we're ready! Yes, we're ready!
Yes, we're ready!

854
01:13:29,800 --> 01:13:33,156
- Do we fight?!
- Yes, we fight!

855
01:13:33,240 --> 01:13:36,277
- Yes, we fight!
- Gentlemen, please!

856
01:13:41,040 --> 01:13:44,396
Is there not enough talk
of fighting in the world?

857
01:13:44,480 --> 01:13:48,678
Sir, we're having a convocation
to prevent your departure.

858
01:13:48,760 --> 01:13:51,274
Oh... really, Atkins.

859
01:13:52,360 --> 01:13:54,635
All of you...

860
01:13:54,720 --> 01:13:57,598
That is... most kind.

861
01:13:57,680 --> 01:13:59,875
But I fear you mustn't.

862
01:13:59,960 --> 01:14:03,999
- But, sir...
- No! The Headmaster has spoken.

863
01:14:04,080 --> 01:14:07,629
He is charged with running
and improving the school.

864
01:14:07,720 --> 01:14:11,599
His authority cannot be questioned.
We must have hierarchies.

865
01:14:11,680 --> 01:14:14,717
We must have... points of reference.

866
01:14:16,680 --> 01:14:20,275
I thank you but you must dismiss.

867
01:14:20,360 --> 01:14:22,112
Go on.

868
01:15:05,720 --> 01:15:07,676
Here it is now.

869
01:15:09,240 --> 01:15:10,719
Yes!

870
01:15:12,080 --> 01:15:14,548
Shall I accompany you to the station?

871
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:17,074
No, thank you. No.

872
01:15:18,360 --> 01:15:20,794
Drill in five minutes!

873
01:15:20,880 --> 01:15:26,876
Does your cousin have need of a...
slightly experienced Latin master?

874
01:15:26,960 --> 01:15:30,396
My dearest Chipping, I greatly appreciate

875
01:15:30,480 --> 01:15:34,792
the sacrifice you have made
but you must retract your position.

876
01:15:34,880 --> 01:15:37,440
I beg of you, reconsider, please.

877
01:15:37,520 --> 01:15:39,556
Do it for me.

878
01:15:43,200 --> 01:15:45,270
Too late, I fear.

879
01:15:51,440 --> 01:15:53,317
Sir John.

880
01:15:56,600 --> 01:15:59,990
Max, you're a marvellous friend.

881
01:16:01,400 --> 01:16:04,198
Please... take good care of yourself.

882
01:16:15,120 --> 01:16:18,317
He has become a focus of discontent.

883
01:16:18,400 --> 01:16:20,709
The boys are openly rebellious.

884
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:24,110
I've known him eccentric
but never dramatic.

885
01:16:25,880 --> 01:16:29,429
Suppose we allowed
a limited number of bursaries?

886
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:33,149
- You mean I should back down?!
- No. No, my dear fellow.

887
01:16:33,240 --> 01:16:37,074
The governors wish me
to surrender to insubordination?

888
01:16:37,160 --> 01:16:40,789
No, of course not,
the governors do understand.

889
01:16:40,880 --> 01:16:43,474
It's just... I just worry.

890
01:16:43,560 --> 01:16:46,632
Chips has taught
generations of some families.

891
01:16:46,720 --> 01:16:49,188
I showed him round on his first day.

892
01:16:49,280 --> 01:16:54,400
Sir John, the boys and the masters
are all aware of this confrontation.

893
01:16:54,480 --> 01:16:58,155
Were Chipping to be reinstated,
my authority...

894
01:16:58,240 --> 01:16:59,639
Gone.

895
01:17:01,040 --> 01:17:04,032
No leader governs by ultimatum,
as you know,

896
01:17:04,120 --> 01:17:07,635
but in this case,
I fear it has come to a choice.

897
01:17:13,760 --> 01:17:15,432
Morning, school.

898
01:17:15,520 --> 01:17:18,353
Good morning, Headmaster.

899
01:17:18,440 --> 01:17:21,034
Good morning, school.

900
01:17:21,120 --> 01:17:24,669
Good morning, Headmaster.

901
01:17:27,160 --> 01:17:31,233
In the few weeks I've been here
we've achieved a great deal.

902
01:17:31,320 --> 01:17:35,836
But there's more to do. Some of you
may recognise our guest today.

903
01:17:35,920 --> 01:17:39,390
A pleasant surprise,
the chairman of our governors,

904
01:17:39,480 --> 01:17:41,550
Sir John Rivers.

905
01:17:41,640 --> 01:17:44,791
I'm sure he will have a few words
to say to us

906
01:17:44,880 --> 01:17:49,795
about the necessary changes
which Brookfield must now embrace.

907
01:17:51,280 --> 01:17:52,838
Sir John.

908
01:17:57,680 --> 01:17:59,796
Good morning, gentlemen.

909
01:18:00,880 --> 01:18:04,270
My time at Brookfield shaped my life

910
01:18:04,360 --> 01:18:09,673
and I'm pleased and proud to be
here today to acknowledge that.

911
01:18:09,760 --> 01:18:12,752
The headmaster has spoken of change

912
01:18:12,840 --> 01:18:15,957
and we must all embrace change,

913
01:18:16,040 --> 01:18:17,951
however unpleasant.

914
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:23,357
But we at Brookfield must also
be aware of that sense of continuity

915
01:18:23,440 --> 01:18:26,477
and tradition
that has made us what we are -

916
01:18:26,560 --> 01:18:28,516
Brookfeldians.

917
01:18:29,960 --> 01:18:34,636
As you are aware, one of the pillars
of the school has been your -

918
01:18:34,720 --> 01:18:39,111
and my - Latin teacher, Mr Chipping.

919
01:18:39,200 --> 01:18:43,990
You are also aware that
we have been in danger of losing him.

920
01:18:45,920 --> 01:18:49,196
I now invite him to change his decision.

921
01:18:50,480 --> 01:18:54,871
And to confirm that he will
stay with us by leading us all

922
01:18:54,960 --> 01:18:56,871
in the school prayer.

923
01:19:07,640 --> 01:19:10,712
You have placed me
in an impossible position.

924
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:12,950
You've done that for yourself.

925
01:19:14,880 --> 01:19:18,475
- Come on, sir!
- Yes, sir!

926
01:19:18,560 --> 01:19:20,152
Chips!

927
01:19:20,240 --> 01:19:24,153
Chips! Chips!

928
01:19:24,240 --> 01:19:28,677
Chips! Chips! Chips!

929
01:19:58,160 --> 01:19:59,798
O Lord,

930
01:19:59,880 --> 01:20:02,838
shine your light on Brookfield school...

931
01:20:02,920 --> 01:20:07,072
on her teachers and on her students.

932
01:20:07,160 --> 01:20:10,675
Grant us the enlightenment
of eternal knowledge

933
01:20:10,760 --> 01:20:13,672
that we may proceed
along a path of learning

934
01:20:13,760 --> 01:20:16,991
that has been illuminated
with your grace.

935
01:20:18,280 --> 01:20:20,635
- Amen.
- Amen.

936
01:20:34,960 --> 01:20:36,757
Colley, isn't it?

937
01:20:36,840 --> 01:20:40,435
Yes, yes, I always recognise a Colley.

938
01:20:46,880 --> 01:20:49,110
How are you, sir?

939
01:20:51,880 --> 01:20:53,632
Oh, my dear fellow.

940
01:21:02,840 --> 01:21:04,796
The mud is grey...

941
01:21:06,320 --> 01:21:08,356
not brown like ours.

942
01:21:13,040 --> 01:21:15,031
It makes sucking noises...

943
01:21:16,960 --> 01:21:18,837
It sucks men down.

944
01:21:20,920 --> 01:21:23,275
You're not supposed to drown in mud,

945
01:21:23,360 --> 01:21:25,715
you're supposed to drown in water.

946
01:21:28,040 --> 01:21:29,996
'Lost a boot, sir.

947
01:21:31,320 --> 01:21:33,276
'Stepped on something.

948
01:21:34,360 --> 01:21:36,271
'His body, sir.'

949
01:21:40,720 --> 01:21:45,271
'School, we have informed
the War Ministry in London

950
01:21:45,360 --> 01:21:47,999
'that we have ploughed our playing fields

951
01:21:48,080 --> 01:21:50,355
'and we now await their directions

952
01:21:50,440 --> 01:21:53,671
'as to which crops
we shall be required to grow.'

953
01:21:55,720 --> 01:21:57,597
Come in!

954
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:03,709
Oh! Gentlemen. Heavens. Sir John.

955
01:22:03,800 --> 01:22:08,794
- Hello, sir.
- Oh, it's young Sexton, isn't it?

956
01:22:08,880 --> 01:22:12,111
Yes, it is.
More down to earth than I remember.

957
01:22:12,200 --> 01:22:15,033
Yes. I avoid roofs, sir.
So good to see you.

958
01:22:15,120 --> 01:22:17,031
Shall we all sit down?

959
01:22:24,280 --> 01:22:27,113
Mr Chipping, we want to thank you.

960
01:22:27,200 --> 01:22:30,351
Since Mr Ralston decided
to rejoin his regiment,

961
01:22:30,440 --> 01:22:34,228
you've accepted extra
responsibilities at a difficult time

962
01:22:34,320 --> 01:22:37,949
and we appreciate your efforts.

963
01:22:39,760 --> 01:22:44,675
We know that retirement
could and should be your reward...

964
01:22:45,640 --> 01:22:49,758
but my fellow governors and I
would like formally to offer you

965
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:52,673
the position of Headmaster of Brookfield.

966
01:22:55,480 --> 01:22:58,313
It's an appointment that's long overdue.

967
01:23:03,240 --> 01:23:05,151
I shall be honoured.

968
01:23:09,280 --> 01:23:10,998
Thank you.

969
01:23:11,520 --> 01:23:13,078
Thank you.

970
01:23:27,400 --> 01:23:29,960
Come in.

971
01:23:32,840 --> 01:23:34,990
Good morning, Headmaster.

972
01:23:35,080 --> 01:23:37,514
Yes, it is rather, it is.

973
01:23:49,240 --> 01:23:50,593
Sir.

974
01:23:50,680 --> 01:23:52,910
Pet centipede, Callender?

975
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:54,956
- Sir?
- All these pigs.

976
01:23:56,120 --> 01:23:59,510
- Sir, I fag for Beccles.
- Oh-oh, please,

977
01:23:59,600 --> 01:24:01,556
don't tell me, Callender.

978
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,468
And do you know why?

979
01:24:06,560 --> 01:24:09,074
The quartermaster had a wooden leg!

980
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:12,558
Headmaster!

981
01:24:25,080 --> 01:24:26,991
Beccles, make me some toast.

982
01:24:28,040 --> 01:24:31,715
Lancaster, see if you can't
put a shine on these pigs.

983
01:24:34,080 --> 01:24:36,719
Sir... we don't fag.

984
01:24:38,600 --> 01:24:40,750
- We're not...
- Precisely.

985
01:24:42,320 --> 01:24:45,949
Nobody fags for me
and I'm more senior than you.

986
01:24:46,040 --> 01:24:47,792
Pass it on.

987
01:25:07,480 --> 01:25:09,675
You wanted to see me, Headmaster?

988
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:11,716
Yes, come in, Morgan.

989
01:25:16,160 --> 01:25:20,039
This wretched war has taken
such a heavy toll on everyone.

990
01:25:22,280 --> 01:25:25,477
There isn't an easy way
to say this, Morgan.

991
01:25:26,640 --> 01:25:30,872
I've received news that your father
has been killed in action.

992
01:25:31,960 --> 01:25:33,916
I'm so sorry.

993
01:25:39,240 --> 01:25:42,277
I feel certain
that he made a fine soldier.

994
01:25:43,360 --> 01:25:45,271
He was a fine student.

995
01:25:45,360 --> 01:25:47,316
Brilliant linguist.

996
01:25:47,400 --> 01:25:49,391
He spoke perfect German.

997
01:25:50,440 --> 01:25:52,317
He had a good teacher.

998
01:25:52,400 --> 01:25:55,437
I hate Germans! I hate them all!

999
01:25:59,920 --> 01:26:02,229
I'm so sorry.

that Maximillian Friedmann Staefel

- was killed two weeks ago.
- Filthy Hun.

This school... owes him much.

1030
01:28:12,960 --> 01:28:16,475
Such capacities as a teacher -
and human being -

1031
01:28:16,560 --> 01:28:20,553
must not be clouded
by issues of nationality

1032
01:28:21,680 --> 01:28:23,636
even in such crucial times.

1033
01:28:25,280 --> 01:28:28,750
Individuals are not nations.

1034
01:28:30,360 --> 01:28:32,351
Let us remember Max Staefel.

1035
01:28:32,440 --> 01:28:35,318
Let us remember them all in our thoughts.

1036
01:28:39,720 --> 01:28:42,029
Today we will call upon Mr Gibbon

1037
01:28:42,120 --> 01:28:45,192
and his Decline And Fall
Of The Roman Empire

1038
01:28:45,280 --> 01:28:48,397
to show us that history repeats itself.

1039
01:28:48,480 --> 01:28:52,473
Will you turn, please,
to chapter nine of volume two.

1040
01:29:07,240 --> 01:29:10,789
Wars and the administration
of public affairs

1041
01:29:10,880 --> 01:29:13,599
are the principal subjects of history.

1042
01:29:13,680 --> 01:29:15,557
Thank you, Warburton.

1043
01:29:15,640 --> 01:29:17,870
Who will continue? Mr Lancaster.

1044
01:29:21,840 --> 01:29:25,719
"But the number of persons interested
in these scenes is different..."

1045
01:29:27,640 --> 01:29:30,473
"..according to the different
condition of mankind."

1046
01:29:32,480 --> 01:29:36,109
Now what Mr Gibbon is saying here,
or is about to say...

1047
01:29:38,720 --> 01:29:40,950
..and Mr Gibbon would hope for

1048
01:29:41,040 --> 01:29:44,749
fewer lightnings from the gods
when saying so,

1049
01:29:44,840 --> 01:29:50,437
is that people who are calm
and occupied in peaceful countries

1050
01:29:50,520 --> 01:29:53,512
never make war.

1051
01:29:53,600 --> 01:29:55,750
Continue please, Mr Lancaster.

1052
01:29:55,840 --> 01:29:58,593
"But the state of freedom and barbarism,

1053
01:29:58,680 --> 01:30:02,389
"the season of civil commotions..."

1054
01:30:02,480 --> 01:30:06,598
"raises almost every member
of the community into action

1055
01:30:06,680 --> 01:30:08,830
"and consequently into notice."

1056
01:30:11,360 --> 01:30:14,158
Gentlemen, take cover under your desks!

1057
01:30:26,240 --> 01:30:30,870
Now, gentlemen, this next passage
I count important enough

1058
01:30:30,960 --> 01:30:32,791
to have you repeat after me.

1059
01:30:34,480 --> 01:30:38,678
"The irregular division
and restless motions"

1060
01:30:38,760 --> 01:30:42,639
"The irregular division
and restless motions"

1061
01:30:42,720 --> 01:30:47,316
- "of the people of Germany"
- "of the people of Germany"

1062
01:30:47,400 --> 01:30:51,678
"dazzle our imaginations
and seem to multiply their numbers."

1063
01:30:51,760 --> 01:30:55,548
"Dazzle our imaginations
and seem to multiply their numbers."

1064
01:30:55,640 --> 01:30:58,996
"The profuse enumeration of kings"

1065
01:30:59,080 --> 01:31:00,877
Vailes!

1066
01:31:08,800 --> 01:31:12,236
Stay put, boys!
Nobody get out from the desks!

1067
01:31:14,560 --> 01:31:16,994
Stay there! Nobody move!

1068
01:31:19,400 --> 01:31:21,277
It's one of theirs!

1069
01:32:02,280 --> 01:32:07,832
- Hier sind Sie in Sicherheit.
- Danke... sagte...

1070
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:23,676
The German boy sent me
a letter when the war was over.

1071
01:32:23,760 --> 01:32:29,995
I recall thinking at the time
that he was a sixth former somewhere.

1072
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:34,039
- They lost their young men too.
- We all lost someone.

1073
01:32:34,120 --> 01:32:37,954
Is it true you gave him
walnut cake with pink icing?

1074
01:32:38,040 --> 01:32:43,717
Mm. My late wife, Katherine,
believed it improved people.

1075
01:32:43,800 --> 01:32:46,519
I think she was right.

1076
01:32:47,880 --> 01:32:51,077
Wonderful to have the photography club.

1077
01:32:51,160 --> 01:32:53,469
Do you remember Staefel?

1078
01:32:53,560 --> 01:32:58,031
I'm certain he would have been here
for today's celebrations.

1079
01:32:59,040 --> 01:33:00,996
Beautiful singing voice.

1080
01:33:01,080 --> 01:33:05,471
I think that's why old Wetherby
was so fond of him.

1081
01:33:08,720 --> 01:33:10,870
Chips, how are you feeling today?

1082
01:33:10,960 --> 01:33:12,916
I'm hale again, thank you.

1083
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:17,869
I, er... I do feel, sir, that
you ought not to overdo it today.

1084
01:33:17,960 --> 01:33:19,712
Poppycock.

1085
01:33:19,800 --> 01:33:22,872
Let us... celebrate our history.

1086
01:33:44,280 --> 01:33:47,750
- My dear Sexton.
- Sir, you haven't met my wife.

1087
01:33:47,840 --> 01:33:51,230
Darling, this is...
Well, you know who this is.

1088
01:33:51,320 --> 01:33:53,390
I've heard so much about you!

1089
01:33:53,480 --> 01:33:55,118
Thank you.

1090
01:33:56,760 --> 01:34:01,151
- Hello, Chips.
- Sir. It's Callender. How are you?

1091
01:34:01,240 --> 01:34:05,950
Callender is single-handedly
responsible for the end of fagging.

1092
01:34:11,720 --> 01:34:13,073
Oh!

1093
01:34:13,160 --> 01:34:15,628
My dear... Colley!

1094
01:34:17,280 --> 01:34:20,352
I'm so very pleased to see you.

1095
01:34:20,440 --> 01:34:22,670
It's so good to see you, sir.

1096
01:34:22,760 --> 01:34:24,955
Why don't you have a seat, sir?

1097
01:34:25,040 --> 01:34:27,076
Yes.

1098
01:34:27,160 --> 01:34:29,196
I think I will, thank you.

1099
01:34:30,640 --> 01:34:32,835
Thank you. Thank you.

1100
01:34:32,920 --> 01:34:36,196
And now, Mr Chipping -

1101
01:34:36,280 --> 01:34:38,032
Chips -

1102
01:34:38,120 --> 01:34:42,716
the very first copy of
the new history of Brookfield School

1103
01:34:42,800 --> 01:34:44,677
with all our best wishes.

1104
01:34:47,600 --> 01:34:49,989
- Well done, sir.
- Thank you.

1105
01:34:52,800 --> 01:34:56,509
Sir. Sir, I hope you remember me,
I'm Rushton.

1106
01:34:56,600 --> 01:35:00,115
Of course I do! Rushton.

1107
01:35:00,200 --> 01:35:03,158
How very nice to see you.
How are you?

1108
01:35:03,240 --> 01:35:07,313
I'm awfully well, sir.
I'd love you to meet my daughter.

1109
01:35:07,400 --> 01:35:10,472
She knows all about you
and, er, Mrs Chipping.

1110
01:35:10,560 --> 01:35:12,471
I've called her Kathie.

1111
01:35:15,960 --> 01:35:17,757
Oh!

1112
01:35:17,840 --> 01:35:19,751
Kathie.

1113
01:35:21,240 --> 01:35:24,755
You see, Chips, everyone loves you.

1114
01:36:02,960 --> 01:36:06,077
My father attended his wife.

1115
01:36:06,160 --> 01:36:09,311
They were very happy by all accounts.

1116
01:36:11,160 --> 01:36:13,674
So sad, they never had any children.

1117
01:36:13,760 --> 01:36:19,312
Oh? But I do have children.

1118
01:36:20,480 --> 01:36:23,074
Hundreds of them.

1119
01:36:23,160 --> 01:36:25,230
All boys.

1120
01:36:27,360 --> 01:36:29,430
Unsley...

1121
01:36:30,240 --> 01:36:32,549
Vailes...

1122
01:36:32,640 --> 01:36:35,108
Wagstaff...

1123
01:36:35,200 --> 01:36:37,475
Watling...

1124
01:36:37,560 --> 01:36:39,437
Warburton...

1125
01:36:40,240 --> 01:36:42,390
Waveney...

1126
01:36:42,480 --> 01:36:44,516
Yates...

1127
01:36:44,600 --> 01:36:46,079
Yelland...

1128
01:36:47,160 --> 01:36:48,752
Young...

1129
01:36:49,840 --> 01:36:51,478
Come along!

1130
01:36:51,560 --> 01:36:53,710
In before the bell!

1131
01:37:12,040 --> 01:37:13,758
Oh...

1132
01:37:14,480 --> 01:37:16,277
Kathie.
