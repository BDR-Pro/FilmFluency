1
00:00:29,596 --> 00:00:30,733
That way, that way.

2
00:00:37,571 --> 00:00:39,844
- Nothing here.
- That damn...

3
00:00:55,289 --> 00:00:56,698
"Take up arms, Italians!"

4
00:00:57,224 --> 00:00:58,395
Yeah, we sure will.

5
00:00:58,625 --> 00:01:00,432
Let's wreck this place, come on.

6
00:01:09,136 --> 00:01:10,477
I'll piss on that.

7
00:01:14,942 --> 00:01:18,613
This'll teach them to leave
some valuables home next time.

8
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:20,780
Let's scram!

9
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:26,759
Why don't you try and rebel now?!

10
00:01:49,743 --> 00:01:51,812
STREET LAW

11
00:02:46,033 --> 00:02:48,033
A. MEROLA'S - FINE WATCHMAKING

12
00:04:54,795 --> 00:04:57,932
Excuse me? I have to
collect a parcel on delivery.

13
00:04:58,198 --> 00:05:00,039
- Desk number six.
- Thanks.

14
00:05:04,337 --> 00:05:05,542
- Can you process this?
- Yeah.

15
00:05:11,812 --> 00:05:13,949
One million two hundred
and fifty thousand lire.

16
00:05:30,964 --> 00:05:32,805
Freeze! This is a hold-up!

17
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:34,169
Be quiet and still!

18
00:05:34,467 --> 00:05:36,536
Don't move and
no funny business!

19
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:39,746
I'll kill whoever tries
to press the alarm!

20
00:05:40,707 --> 00:05:41,707
I'll take this.

21
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:45,718
Open the safe and
fill this up, quick!

22
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:49,590
Everybody face the wall! Now!

23
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:52,585
Where do you think you're
going?! Against the wall!

24
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:54,998
You too!

25
00:05:56,156 --> 00:05:58,429
To the wall, move it!

26
00:05:58,658 --> 00:06:00,227
No, young man, don't...

27
00:06:01,261 --> 00:06:02,261
Shut her up!

28
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:05,166
Shut your trap or I'll kill you!

29
00:06:05,432 --> 00:06:07,273
Fuck! Outta the way!

30
00:06:08,501 --> 00:06:10,376
Can it! Shut up!

31
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:14,945
Get a move on and
empty the register!

32
00:06:15,442 --> 00:06:18,852
Fill them up! Move
it and hurry up!

33
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:26,457
You keep still and
don't move an inch!

34
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,095
Hurry up! Get a move on!

35
00:06:30,457 --> 00:06:32,435
Hurry up, hand
over all the money!

36
00:06:34,094 --> 00:06:36,367
Stand up! Stand up, dammit!

37
00:06:36,796 --> 00:06:40,467
Face the wall! Move
it! Move it, I said!

38
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:48,413
- Stop her!
- Hold it right there!

39
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:51,910
Shut up or I'll empty the whole
magazine into your mouths!

40
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:53,784
What are you trying to do?!

41
00:07:09,396 --> 00:07:10,396
Run for it!

42
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:13,640
- Quick, we gotta go!
- Don't you try to move!

43
00:07:15,135 --> 00:07:17,579
On your feet! You're
coming with us!

44
00:07:18,171 --> 00:07:19,171
Move it!

45
00:07:19,472 --> 00:07:21,848
The money! Hand it over!

46
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:28,113
Go!

47
00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:37,633
Hurry up and run!

48
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:39,124
Keep going!

49
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:44,436
- Get in the car, quick!
- Let's move!

50
00:07:48,935 --> 00:07:52,606
We must do better if we want to
carry out our hat-trick of robberies!

51
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:54,708
Only this jerk is to blame!

52
00:07:55,008 --> 00:07:56,952
You tried playing the hero, huh?

53
00:07:59,112 --> 00:08:01,317
Assholes like you
gotta learn the way it is!

54
00:08:02,849 --> 00:08:06,350
I swear, if things go sour for
us, you'll be getting it worse!

55
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:15,668
Step on it!

56
00:08:17,731 --> 00:08:18,731
Look out!

57
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:37,655
Here they come!

58
00:08:41,388 --> 00:08:44,093
Step on it! Faster!

59
00:08:45,892 --> 00:08:49,268
Car 2 calling HQ, they're on
the road near the waterfront.

60
00:08:49,763 --> 00:08:50,866
They're heading south.

61
00:08:51,164 --> 00:08:55,938
<i>Hear you loud and clear.
White car, four robbers inside.</i>

62
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:59,677
<i>The vehicle is heading
towards Corso Italia.</i>

63
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:05,746
<i>Exercise extreme caution,
the robbers are armed.</i>

64
00:09:06,346 --> 00:09:10,915
<i>- Calling Car 12, over.</i>
- Car 12 speaking, over.

65
00:09:11,584 --> 00:09:15,289
<i>They have a hostage,
presumably wounded.</i>

66
00:09:15,789 --> 00:09:17,426
<i>Be careful, they are armed.</i>

67
00:09:17,857 --> 00:09:19,130
Copy that, over.

68
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:25,369
We'd better head back towards the city
centre if we want to lose them, turn left!

69
00:09:32,105 --> 00:09:36,481
<i>Calling Car 7, requesting
their current status, over.</i>

70
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,479
City centre, on Via
Venti Settembre!

71
00:09:39,112 --> 00:09:40,112
Go! Go!

72
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:45,548
White car, Alfa Giulia model,
license plate Genoa 446719,

73
00:09:45,819 --> 00:09:48,820
they are leaving Corso Italia
and entering Via Venti Settembre.

74
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:50,559
Heavy traffic.

75
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:14,352
They're done for!

76
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:27,698
Blast it! There's another one!

77
00:10:36,703 --> 00:10:38,772
Watch it, they're firing.
Don't get too close.

78
00:10:45,945 --> 00:10:48,514
They're on Corso Italia and
headed towards Ponte Assereto.

79
00:10:49,048 --> 00:10:52,049
- Copu that. Go.
<i>- Calling all cars.</i>

80
00:10:52,619 --> 00:10:58,893
<i>Calling Car 6, 9 and 12 to
converge on the robbers' vehicle.</i>

81
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:17,209
Keep going!

82
00:11:50,743 --> 00:11:52,277
Go, come on!

83
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,455
Car 7 calling HQ.

84
00:11:56,349 --> 00:11:59,293
We had an accident and lost
contact with the robbers' car.

85
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:01,223
We're heading
back to Corso Italia.

86
00:12:02,255 --> 00:12:06,426
- Awaiting orders.
<i>- Car 7, we're in Via Felice Cavallotti.</i>

87
00:12:07,026 --> 00:12:13,459
<i>Car 73 to Car 7, white Alfa headed
towards the docks area on Via Gramsci.</i>

88
00:12:13,933 --> 00:12:19,309
<i>To all cars patrolling Ponte San Giorgio,
Ponte Etiopia, Ponte Resea and Ponte Libia,</i>

89
00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:22,947
<i>the robbers' white Alfa is
headed towards the docks.</i>

90
00:12:24,043 --> 00:12:27,748
Car 18 to Car 73, we're
reaching Ponte Assereto.

91
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:31,457
<i>Car 73 to Car 19, converge to the
shipping containers section of the docks.</i>

92
00:12:31,951 --> 00:12:39,589
<i>The post office robbers' car has been
reported in the Ponte Assereto area.</i>

93
00:12:39,926 --> 00:12:46,098
<i>The post office robbers' white car has
been reported in the Ponte Assereto area.</i>

94
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:48,842
Car 19, copy that. We're
heading to Ponte Assereto.

95
00:12:49,068 --> 00:12:53,512
<i>Calling Car 16. Robbers'
car located in Ponte Assereto.</i>

96
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:57,410
<i>Converge to the shipping
containers section in Ponte Assereto.</i>

97
00:12:57,944 --> 00:13:00,945
Car 19 to Car 73, we're
reaching Ponte Assereto.

98
00:13:07,987 --> 00:13:09,260
We have reached the white Alfa.

99
00:13:09,589 --> 00:13:14,033
<i>Car 73 to Car 12 and 16, robbers' car
located in shipping containers section.</i>

100
00:13:15,028 --> 00:13:19,768
Car 19 to Car 73, we
found the robbers' car,

101
00:13:20,099 --> 00:13:23,441
only the wounded hostage is
on board, we need an ambulance.

102
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:27,680
Don't worry, everything's fine.

103
00:13:29,108 --> 00:13:30,847
You're lucky, nothing's broken.

104
00:13:31,511 --> 00:13:33,455
An ambulance is on its way.

105
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:37,315
Stay back, everyone.

106
00:13:37,684 --> 00:13:39,287
Nothing to see here.

107
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:50,898
I... I'll kill them!

108
00:13:53,066 --> 00:13:54,737
I swear I'll kill them!

109
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:58,871
They're dead if I get
my hands on them!

110
00:14:14,887 --> 00:14:17,058
- This one?
- No.

111
00:14:19,826 --> 00:14:21,326
You recognise this one?

112
00:14:25,231 --> 00:14:26,231
No.

113
00:14:29,268 --> 00:14:30,268
No.

114
00:14:36,743 --> 00:14:37,743
No.

115
00:14:39,078 --> 00:14:41,113
- This one?
- No.

116
00:14:41,948 --> 00:14:43,357
Are you positive?

117
00:14:47,353 --> 00:14:48,353
Yes.

118
00:14:52,925 --> 00:14:54,925
I'll never forget those faces.

119
00:14:57,764 --> 00:15:01,435
Amateurs, probably, considering you
couldn't identify these slides you've seen.

120
00:15:03,269 --> 00:15:04,440
They were professionals.

121
00:15:05,371 --> 00:15:07,371
They only pretended to
be on edge, to scare us.

122
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:08,740
Ah, I see.

123
00:15:09,642 --> 00:15:12,245
You're one of those individuals
who'd like to teach us our trade.

124
00:15:12,945 --> 00:15:14,980
I'm not trying to
teach you anything!

125
00:15:15,314 --> 00:15:17,383
I just want you to
catch those criminals!

126
00:15:17,717 --> 00:15:21,161
And yet, here I am feeling like I'm the
crook being grilled by you people!

127
00:15:22,388 --> 00:15:23,888
Are you going to
cooperate or not?

128
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:27,625
Plenty of robberies every day, we can't
post a policeman on every corner.

129
00:15:28,895 --> 00:15:31,668
This kind of criminals are armed
and dangerous, not to be provoked.

130
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:35,269
Even bank tellers are
instructed to comply with robbers.

131
00:15:36,335 --> 00:15:38,313
Very unwise of you to resist.

132
00:15:39,806 --> 00:15:42,977
Resist? I wasn't resisting!

133
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:46,012
I... I only tried to
get my money back!

134
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:48,351
It was hard-earned,
you understand?

135
00:15:49,015 --> 00:15:51,118
They hit me! What
was I supposed to do?!

136
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:52,958
Thank them and say I was sorry?

137
00:15:53,486 --> 00:15:56,191
"Please, go ahead
and destroy my face!"

138
00:15:56,689 --> 00:15:58,530
"The police won't let
you get away with this."

139
00:16:00,593 --> 00:16:01,696
Police, right...

140
00:16:02,428 --> 00:16:04,769
You wouldn't catch a criminal
if he landed on your hands.

141
00:16:11,537 --> 00:16:13,515
Please, Carlo, calm down now.

142
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:18,447
Forgive him, it's the reaction
of a man with a broken head.

143
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:20,486
Broken but thick.

144
00:16:23,049 --> 00:16:24,788
You're one lucky individual.

145
00:16:26,219 --> 00:16:27,219
You got off easy.

146
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:32,323
Right. Nothing really happened.

147
00:16:33,192 --> 00:16:35,067
You don't care about
citizens like myself.

148
00:16:38,798 --> 00:16:41,799
Do you feel better after
lashing out at the police?

149
00:16:42,235 --> 00:16:44,804
You could have gotten arrested
for insulting a public official.

150
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:48,983
Stop thinking about
what happened.

151
00:16:50,042 --> 00:16:51,645
I was scared and
they humiliated me!

152
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:53,648
You cannot even
imagine how scared I was!

153
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:55,888
It wasn't because they had guns.

154
00:16:56,082 --> 00:16:57,923
I just can't lose
my self-respect!

155
00:16:59,352 --> 00:17:00,852
I'll kill them if I
find them again.

156
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:02,220
Don't talk nonsense.

157
00:17:02,588 --> 00:17:06,328
- Be reasonable.
- Are you asking me to be a coward?

158
00:17:09,262 --> 00:17:11,763
Better to be cowardly
than reckless.

159
00:17:12,331 --> 00:17:17,775
Sure, right, you're suggesting me to
keep feeling scared and humiliated?

160
00:17:18,271 --> 00:17:20,749
And only because there's
nobody willing to protect us!

161
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:22,247
ITALIANS, REBEL!
NOW IS THE TIME!

162
00:17:22,408 --> 00:17:24,079
I'm sick of being kicked around!

163
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:26,783
What did the police do
when they got here? Nothing!

164
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:30,216
They didn't lift a finger after crooks
robbed and almost torched down my home!

165
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:31,950
They only asked if I'm insured!

166
00:17:32,451 --> 00:17:35,258
Like I'm in cahoots with the thieves
to cheat the insurance company!

167
00:17:35,855 --> 00:17:37,299
Of course crimes
are on the rise!

168
00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:41,365
Criminals wouldn't go around
killing people if they kept them in jail!

169
00:17:42,128 --> 00:17:45,129
If I died I'd save them the
trouble of arresting the culprits!

170
00:17:49,802 --> 00:17:52,575
You've got to stand up for yourself,
no one else would protect you.

171
00:17:52,872 --> 00:17:54,747
What could you do
on your own, Carlo?

172
00:17:55,041 --> 00:17:57,780
If you're so keen to play the hero,
why don't you marry me first?

173
00:17:58,377 --> 00:18:00,980
- So I'd have your pension and insurance.
- Knock it off, Barbara.

174
00:18:01,314 --> 00:18:03,553
Becoming a wealthy widow
doesn't sound too bad.

175
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:08,258
Don't you understand that one's gotta
fight their fears to overcome them?

176
00:18:09,322 --> 00:18:13,391
My only fear is for your sanity, after
taking so many blows to your head.

177
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:15,168
You're not special, you know?

178
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:16,962
You think this is the wild west?

179
00:18:17,263 --> 00:18:20,571
Bandits ride into town and you put
your star on before blazing them away?

180
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:25,572
Quit complaining and playing the
victim! You're acting like a pathetic wuss!

181
00:19:08,447 --> 00:19:11,357
<i>- Excuse me, I'm looking for some people...
- Scram, fool.</i>

182
00:19:16,689 --> 00:19:19,860
<i>Is there a tall, blond man who speaks
the Veneto dialect among your customers?</i>

183
00:19:20,126 --> 00:19:22,331
<i>I get people of all races.</i>

184
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:29,136
<i>Yeah, it's three young men,
with lots of money to splash.</i>

185
00:19:29,702 --> 00:19:32,680
<i>I wish, I only find
deadbeats around here.</i>

186
00:19:35,408 --> 00:19:37,386
<i>Excuse me, I'm
looking for three...</i>

187
00:19:37,576 --> 00:19:40,077
<i>I dunno, try the hotel
'round the corner.</i>

188
00:19:40,579 --> 00:19:44,489
<i>You a cop? Only clean customers
here. Check the guestbook if you fancy</i>

189
00:19:45,151 --> 00:19:46,254
<i>Try the docks.</i>

190
00:19:46,719 --> 00:19:48,322
<i>Who are you anyway?
Who knows you?</i>

191
00:19:48,821 --> 00:19:51,731
<i>- Listen, where can I find...
- You lookin' for trouble?</i>

192
00:19:52,391 --> 00:19:55,233
<i>Look for Armando, tell him
the Parisian girl sent you.</i>

193
00:19:56,095 --> 00:19:58,664
<i>You staying or what? Gonna
cost you more if you rent a room.</i>

194
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:01,567
<i>I need to contact some people.</i>

195
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:04,773
<i>You dealing with
hot stuff? Take a hike.</i>

196
00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:08,042
<i>- I'm looking for a guy from Veneto who...
- We don't know nobody</i>

197
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,581
<i>- I'm looking for...
- Put an ad in the papers!</i>

198
00:20:13,446 --> 00:20:16,515
<i>You again?! What the
hell do you want from me?</i>

199
00:20:16,782 --> 00:20:18,089
<i>I only need some names.</i>

200
00:20:18,384 --> 00:20:20,589
<i>Looking for weed? Gino
from the alley's your guy.</i>

201
00:20:21,854 --> 00:20:23,559
<i>- Hello, Ma'am.
- What is it?</i>

202
00:20:23,789 --> 00:20:25,460
<i>Is Gino home? I
need to talk to him.</i>

203
00:20:26,358 --> 00:20:28,302
<i>- Who are you?
- A friend of his.</i>

204
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:33,469
No, he's not here.
He went on vacation.

205
00:20:33,933 --> 00:20:35,036
When will he be back?

206
00:20:35,601 --> 00:20:39,102
Who knows? Maybe with the
next amnesty, if he's eligible.

207
00:20:39,772 --> 00:20:41,250
<i>Really? I heard he got paroled.</i>

208
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:46,050
<i>Well, he missed the friends
he made in the slammer.</i>

209
00:20:46,312 --> 00:20:47,551
<i>He got right back to prison.</i>

210
00:20:48,047 --> 00:20:49,616
<i>Where can I find
some of his friends?</i>

211
00:20:49,882 --> 00:20:52,792
<i>Bar Italia, behind the
Shanghai street market.</i>

212
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:04,162
Get your American
jeans right here.

213
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:08,938
Transistor radios, gas
appliances, I got everything.

214
00:21:10,436 --> 00:21:11,845
Tell the man I'm
looking for him.

215
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:14,514
There will be blood if he
doesn't cough up my money. See you.

216
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:18,013
- Take it easy, tough guy.
- Oh boy, indeed.

217
00:21:18,477 --> 00:21:21,478
- Here's your aperitifs.
- Gee, it was about time.

218
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:25,289
Say, what happened last night?
Did they try to attack the party HQ?

219
00:21:25,618 --> 00:21:29,824
Tried's the word, it was six of
them putting posters on the wall.

220
00:21:30,189 --> 00:21:32,530
They skedaddled as soon as
they saw us, same old story.

221
00:21:32,858 --> 00:21:36,166
Managed to grab one by the
collar, you know what I told the guy?

222
00:21:36,495 --> 00:21:37,802
What will it be?

223
00:21:38,264 --> 00:21:43,038
"I know you're a red, pal, but
I'm gonna beat it outta you!"

224
00:21:43,469 --> 00:21:46,379
So I throw the guy against the wall
and do a number on him with a chain.

225
00:21:46,705 --> 00:21:50,206
Damn coppers appeared
out of the blue, such a shame!

226
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,385
I am looking for
some information.

227
00:21:54,013 --> 00:21:56,820
Why, you're carrying my
favourite business card!

228
00:21:57,950 --> 00:21:59,553
- I'm looking for somebody.
- I'm sorry?

229
00:22:00,386 --> 00:22:02,625
Mind saying that again?
I'm a bit hard of hearing.

230
00:22:03,789 --> 00:22:04,960
Lean closer.

231
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:08,027
Get bent, mate!

232
00:22:09,295 --> 00:22:12,500
You fellas took this place
for an info point or something?

233
00:22:12,798 --> 00:22:15,139
- Why?
- This guy here's seeking information.

234
00:22:15,367 --> 00:22:16,811
And you came to this place?

235
00:22:17,136 --> 00:22:21,410
You better check the yellow pages
instead of busting our balls, pal!

236
00:22:21,674 --> 00:22:25,209
Wait, let's see what he's looking for.
we're all for helping our fellow citizens.

237
00:22:26,812 --> 00:22:28,153
We're all here, spill it.

238
00:22:29,248 --> 00:22:30,726
We're eager to help you out.

239
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:32,753
What the fuck are you
looking for anyway?

240
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,661
Well? Cat got your
tongue? Speak.

241
00:22:36,922 --> 00:22:38,593
You came here
for a reason, right?

242
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:40,259
What do you want?

243
00:22:43,395 --> 00:22:46,498
- I have a car for sale.
- A car? A stolen one, I presume?

244
00:22:47,166 --> 00:22:49,007
Ah, it's a piece of cake.

245
00:22:50,102 --> 00:22:55,342
Look. Go over there, take a
left and then turn right.

246
00:22:55,774 --> 00:23:01,344
When you reach the loo, jump
in and flush, understand?

247
00:23:07,086 --> 00:23:09,064
Watch it! What's
biting you, mate!?

248
00:23:10,756 --> 00:23:12,359
Played you like fools!

249
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:13,933
Made you look like a chump!

250
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:15,760
Let's get him, hurry!

251
00:23:58,737 --> 00:24:01,272
Now you can sell it
to the junkyard, fool!

252
00:24:02,341 --> 00:24:05,683
Don't show your face around
here again, understand?

253
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,680
Let's go!

254
00:24:12,017 --> 00:24:16,461
<i>Are you crazy? You wanted to
get in touch with the underworld?</i>

255
00:24:19,925 --> 00:24:21,698
They can smell
you're not one of them.

256
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:30,298
Carlo, those people are a
different breed, don't you get it?

257
00:24:30,636 --> 00:24:32,705
They have stricter
laws than ours.

258
00:24:32,972 --> 00:24:35,541
You've defended some of them
in court, put me in contact with one.

259
00:24:35,975 --> 00:24:37,975
Are you crazy? I'll never
do something like that!

260
00:24:38,377 --> 00:24:40,116
I don't want you
on my conscience.

261
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:44,446
You do not realise the kind of people
you are trying to get in contact with.

262
00:24:44,717 --> 00:24:48,684
Robbers and ruthless criminals
who kill people without thinking twice.

263
00:24:49,655 --> 00:24:52,326
No way I'm putting you
in touch with any of them.

264
00:24:53,959 --> 00:24:56,335
Forget about this,
Carlo, trust me.

265
00:24:56,862 --> 00:24:59,169
Be grateful you're still alive.

266
00:24:59,832 --> 00:25:04,333
Even you tell me to let it go
and forget what happened!

267
00:25:06,805 --> 00:25:08,214
What do you want me to tell you?

268
00:25:08,741 --> 00:25:11,980
At my age, I realised that this
world is like a theatre of sorts.

269
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:17,717
I have entered, watched the
show and soon I will exit the stage.

270
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:21,060
It is something I have come
to accept, with no regrets.

271
00:25:21,387 --> 00:25:23,660
- You know what I mean?
- Yeah, yeah, sure.

272
00:25:24,556 --> 00:25:26,863
I guess my father
just died for nothing.

273
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:29,436
You were with him when
he wrote the manifesto...

274
00:25:29,695 --> 00:25:31,866
... calling on Italians to
rise up against the Germans.

275
00:25:32,097 --> 00:25:33,404
You shared the same ideals then.

276
00:25:34,033 --> 00:25:37,602
And now you just keep your mouth
shut and suck it up like everyone else.

277
00:25:38,504 --> 00:25:40,675
You know what my father
wrote before they shot him?

278
00:25:41,707 --> 00:25:45,208
"Remember, you must learn
to resist if you want to be free.

279
00:25:45,577 --> 00:25:49,453
If the laws are unjust, it is not only
your right to disobey them, but your duty."

280
00:25:53,352 --> 00:25:56,421
The law is like a spider's
web, you can catch flies with it.

281
00:25:56,722 --> 00:25:58,256
Too bad the bigger
flies break through.

282
00:25:58,457 --> 00:26:02,560
Our web is so broken that
it doesn't even catch gnats.

283
00:26:02,895 --> 00:26:07,271
Too much work to keep track of them, they
stay in jail three months and then get out.

284
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:09,099
Back and forth like commuters.

285
00:26:09,535 --> 00:26:11,240
Here's the dossiers you wanted.

286
00:26:15,941 --> 00:26:18,885
What are you looking for?
Car stealing? Armed robberies?

287
00:26:19,211 --> 00:26:23,121
There's no shortage of choices,
and the culprits are all out there.

288
00:26:24,883 --> 00:26:26,417
You know why judges wear black?

289
00:26:27,386 --> 00:26:28,386
They're in mourning.

290
00:26:28,654 --> 00:26:30,257
I wouldn't know what
to choose between...

291
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:32,332
... falling into the hands
of a doctor or a lawyer.

292
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:34,660
It's like choosing between
a hammer and a hard place.

293
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:38,131
THE ROBBERS OF THE PETROL STATION ATTENDANT
IN VIA NOVARA HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED

294
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:54,354
THE MUGGING OF AN ELDERLY LADY

295
00:26:56,949 --> 00:26:59,950
THEY SMASHED THE SHOP WINDOW AND STOLE
THREE MILLION LIRE WORTH OF JEWELLERY.

296
00:27:15,834 --> 00:27:19,039
Seems like ages since we've seen
each other, you could have given me a call.

297
00:27:19,838 --> 00:27:20,872
Hi.

298
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:22,940
Hey.

299
00:27:26,512 --> 00:27:27,683
Found anything?

300
00:27:28,714 --> 00:27:32,522
Not even the police were
able to get to those three,

301
00:27:33,152 --> 00:27:34,527
but criminals all
know each other.

302
00:27:34,953 --> 00:27:36,658
That's why I'm after
some small-time crooks.

303
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:38,561
I'm getting more knowledgeable,

304
00:27:38,857 --> 00:27:41,494
and I'm beginning to recognise the
techniques of the various gangs.

305
00:27:47,299 --> 00:27:49,402
You must also take care
of your work at the lab.

306
00:27:49,902 --> 00:27:51,311
Leone is dealing with that.

307
00:27:57,876 --> 00:28:00,217
- Any luck concerning your gang?
- My gang?

308
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:05,517
I found out a lot of things, even that
they take hostages when things go wrong.

309
00:28:06,318 --> 00:28:07,852
They usually rob
three banks in a row.

310
00:28:08,187 --> 00:28:09,824
While the police
rush to the first bank,

311
00:28:10,322 --> 00:28:12,698
they are already robbing
the second, and then the third.

312
00:28:13,091 --> 00:28:14,535
They specialise in hat-tricks.

313
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:18,562
They steal about thirty million
lire each time and then disappear,

314
00:28:19,031 --> 00:28:20,406
going on vacation
for a few months.

315
00:28:22,734 --> 00:28:24,212
This is our newest
comic book hero.

316
00:28:24,770 --> 00:28:26,714
Here, keep it for luck.

317
00:28:28,674 --> 00:28:30,345
It's a hunting dog, like you.

318
00:28:32,211 --> 00:28:33,586
Be careful, Carlo. Please.

319
00:28:34,213 --> 00:28:35,247
Don't worry.

320
00:28:42,888 --> 00:28:44,388
I'm sorry about the other day.

321
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:47,290
Forget it.

322
00:28:50,796 --> 00:28:53,206
Hello? Yeah, I'm working
on it, like I told you.

323
00:28:59,638 --> 00:29:01,741
At last, Carlo! What
happened to you?

324
00:29:02,107 --> 00:29:04,949
That company has been
waiting for your report for a week.

325
00:29:06,645 --> 00:29:09,418
- Take care of it and send it off, please.
- I knew it.

326
00:29:10,082 --> 00:29:11,651
- Good morning, Engineer.
- Good morning.

327
00:29:35,841 --> 00:29:37,444
You leaving already?

328
00:29:37,943 --> 00:29:40,682
Yes, I'll be away for a few
days, you take care of the lab.

329
00:29:42,347 --> 00:29:44,291
Heh, like I haven't already...

330
00:29:44,583 --> 00:29:46,959
I wonder what the guy is
cooking, hope it's not trouble.

331
00:30:16,348 --> 00:30:19,656
HE LEAVES THE HOUSE
AT 3:30 P.M. AND GOES TO...

332
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:28,492
Got a light?

333
00:30:41,173 --> 00:30:42,344
Looking for me?

334
00:30:44,376 --> 00:30:46,047
Why have you been
following me all day?

335
00:30:46,478 --> 00:30:48,217
I dunno who you
are and I don't care.

336
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:52,151
Anyway, it's gonna be trouble
if I see you around again.

337
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:56,391
Got that clear?

338
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:02,499
I'm an imbecile, dammit!

339
00:33:46,224 --> 00:33:49,725
... And this in the
case of a ferrous alloy,

340
00:33:50,428 --> 00:33:53,031
most notably stainless steel.

341
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:57,408
The diagram is divided into
two parts, as you can see.

342
00:33:57,869 --> 00:34:03,007
The first, less anodic,
is the activity area.

343
00:34:03,575 --> 00:34:06,746
which ceases at the
passivation curve.

344
00:34:07,212 --> 00:34:13,213
This yelds an average
value which is basically zero,

345
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:16,696
reaching the passivity area.

346
00:34:17,589 --> 00:34:18,964
Therefore, if we...

347
00:34:19,224 --> 00:34:20,224
Hey, but...

348
00:34:21,393 --> 00:34:22,393
Oh, sh...

349
00:34:23,695 --> 00:34:24,934
Good grief, mate.

350
00:34:25,864 --> 00:34:29,103
I'm gonna smash the bastard
who took these pictures to bits.

351
00:34:29,367 --> 00:34:31,277
- This is no joke.
- How do you call it?

352
00:34:31,636 --> 00:34:33,080
Casting call pictures
or something?

353
00:34:33,271 --> 00:34:35,908
- This guy's out to get you.
- Both of us.

354
00:34:36,541 --> 00:34:39,144
Well, then he would have also
chosen some pictures with me.

355
00:34:40,712 --> 00:34:42,383
What, you jealous?

356
00:34:46,718 --> 00:34:49,219
You reckon the cops
are involved in this?

357
00:34:49,621 --> 00:34:51,599
Someone trying to blackmail
you, that's my guess.

358
00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:54,095
Who am l, Paul Getty?

359
00:34:57,562 --> 00:34:59,631
Boy, do I look like a million.

360
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:31,428
I WILL CALL YOU AT THE PHONE
BOOTH IN CORSO PODESTA' AT 3:30 P.M.

361
00:36:24,416 --> 00:36:26,326
Hello? Who the hell are you?

362
00:36:26,818 --> 00:36:27,886
What do you want from me?

363
00:36:29,421 --> 00:36:30,694
Listen up, scoundrel.

364
00:36:31,089 --> 00:36:32,396
If you want those negatives,

365
00:36:32,924 --> 00:36:38,028
get me a sawed-off shotgun, two machine
guns, two pistols and a hundred bullets.

366
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:43,732
Sure, lemme go to the nearest grocery shop
and fix them up! You need cigarettes, too?

367
00:36:44,502 --> 00:36:46,241
You realise how much
that stuff would cost?

368
00:36:46,604 --> 00:36:49,105
One hundred thousand lire per
gun and two thousand per bullet.

369
00:36:49,274 --> 00:36:51,218
Where am I supposed
to get that kind of dough?

370
00:36:55,914 --> 00:36:57,051
Wait a second!

371
00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:00,723
I don't know anything!

372
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:02,719
I was just talking
for the hell of it!

373
00:37:03,922 --> 00:37:05,400
I'm gonna behave
from now on, yes sir.

374
00:37:06,124 --> 00:37:08,397
- It's the truth, I swear.
- Cut it out, you idiot.

375
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:11,699
If I were a cop, I could throw you
in the slammer with those photos.

376
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:15,238
Hurry up and get that stuff, you'll have
the money tomorrow night at ten o'clock.

377
00:38:05,016 --> 00:38:07,289
Still playing
soldiers at your age?

378
00:38:07,919 --> 00:38:10,954
This? No' just preparing
a prank on a friend.

379
00:38:37,482 --> 00:38:38,619
You brought the stuff?

380
00:38:39,450 --> 00:38:43,224
Everything's fine. It's all
clean, no serial numbers.

381
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:46,027
- Where's the dough?
- How much?

382
00:38:46,825 --> 00:38:48,234
Five hundred thousand lire.

383
00:38:49,294 --> 00:38:52,795
Prices have gone up, blame
it on the currency devaluation.

384
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:55,809
You'll find three hundred
thousand lire in the bin behind you.

385
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:58,304
You'll get the rest
tomorrow night at ten.

386
00:38:58,736 --> 00:39:01,305
Hold it! What about
the negatives?

387
00:39:29,834 --> 00:39:31,778
Son of a bitch...

388
00:39:47,352 --> 00:39:48,352
Hello?

389
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:51,098
I knew you'd try to play
a trick on me, dummy.

390
00:39:51,556 --> 00:39:53,932
If you don't bring me the
stuff I asked for tomorrow night,

391
00:39:54,125 --> 00:39:58,728
your next robbery will be in five or
six years, when you get out of jail.

392
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:01,801
There's two hundred thousand
lire in the phone book, take it.

393
00:40:02,133 --> 00:40:05,577
If you try to get smart with me
one more time, you're finished.

394
00:40:47,946 --> 00:40:49,446
Place your bets.

395
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:51,520
Place your bets.

396
00:40:53,785 --> 00:40:55,592
That's it, no more bets.

397
00:41:01,192 --> 00:41:04,863
- Red. Eleven wins.
- The house loses.

398
00:41:05,763 --> 00:41:07,502
- Eleven wins.
- The house loses.

399
00:41:09,033 --> 00:41:10,442
I'd quit if I were you, Peppe.

400
00:41:12,370 --> 00:41:13,609
The house wins.

401
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:20,681
Nice going, luck's
on your side tonight.

402
00:41:27,118 --> 00:41:28,357
The cops! It's the cops!

403
00:41:39,464 --> 00:41:40,839
Freeze, everyone!

404
00:41:41,799 --> 00:41:43,674
Good evening, Inspector.

405
00:41:44,736 --> 00:41:46,407
I'm so glad to see you.

406
00:41:47,171 --> 00:41:48,876
Care for a little pool game?

407
00:41:59,317 --> 00:42:00,920
You sure you're
not up for a game?

408
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:04,820
- Another time.
- Whenever you wish.

409
00:42:07,091 --> 00:42:08,091
Let's go.

410
00:42:09,494 --> 00:42:10,597
See you, boys.

411
00:42:13,264 --> 00:42:14,537
Come again soon.

412
00:42:26,577 --> 00:42:27,611
Hey, Gambino!

413
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:31,624
Scipione sent
me, he says that...

414
00:42:33,785 --> 00:42:35,422
He says you can get
me some hardware.

415
00:42:36,054 --> 00:42:38,225
Didn't he tell you my
name's Mr. Gambino?

416
00:42:38,790 --> 00:42:40,234
- Sorry.
- What do you need?

417
00:42:41,025 --> 00:42:42,798
One sawed-off, two
machine guns, two pistols.

418
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:43,960
- For you?
- No.

419
00:42:44,562 --> 00:42:45,540
Who wants it?

420
00:42:46,264 --> 00:42:50,640
Some independent professionals from
out of town who'd prefer to stay anonymous.

421
00:42:51,202 --> 00:42:53,146
- Who are they?
- I can't name names.

422
00:42:53,871 --> 00:42:55,940
- Price goes up, then.
- That isn't a problem.

423
00:42:56,541 --> 00:42:57,814
These folks are
rolling in dough.

424
00:42:59,110 --> 00:43:01,713
- How much you got now?
- Two hundred thousand. A little advance.

425
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:03,587
Good enough for
a three-days rent.

426
00:43:03,915 --> 00:43:05,120
<i>Ammo paid separately</i>

427
00:43:05,716 --> 00:43:08,092
<i>- When do you need the stuff?
- Tomorrow night.</i>

428
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:10,397
<i>Contact Scipione, he'll
give you the location.</i>

429
00:44:33,538 --> 00:44:38,005
<i>Listen, pal, you are acting
too much like a smart-ass.</i>

430
00:44:38,543 --> 00:44:41,419
Sure, you're blackmailing me with
those pictures, but I've had enough!

431
00:44:41,812 --> 00:44:43,847
It's all getting too confusing
and I've had enough!

432
00:44:44,048 --> 00:44:45,582
What else do you
want from me, dammit?!

433
00:44:45,883 --> 00:44:46,883
Calm down.

434
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:49,219
I have one last request,

435
00:44:49,754 --> 00:44:51,993
then you get those pictures
and we go our separate ways.

436
00:44:52,423 --> 00:44:53,923
I need the best
robbers in business.

437
00:44:54,258 --> 00:44:57,202
Determined men, who know how to use
machine guns and sawed-off shotguns,

438
00:44:57,395 --> 00:44:58,770
with an expertise
in bank robberies.

439
00:44:59,030 --> 00:45:00,769
Tell them to stand
by, I'll be in touch.

440
00:47:16,567 --> 00:47:18,067
It's them! It's them!

441
00:47:18,703 --> 00:47:21,806
I knew I'd find those
sons of bitches again!

442
00:47:26,711 --> 00:47:31,212
<i>Police? Get to the Nautilus
Shipyards at the harbour at once!</i>

443
00:47:31,916 --> 00:47:36,588
There's a warehouse full of weapons,
along with the three post office robbers!

444
00:47:36,987 --> 00:47:39,192
<i>- How do you know that?</i>
- Who cares?! Just hurry up!

445
00:47:39,390 --> 00:47:41,368
<i>- Who are you?</i>
- Move it, for christ's sake!

446
00:47:41,559 --> 00:47:42,559
<i>Repeat the address.</i>

447
00:47:43,361 --> 00:47:45,600
Nautilus Shipyards!
Send somebody!

448
00:48:13,691 --> 00:48:16,930
You're in there, you bastards!
I got you good this time!

449
00:48:29,140 --> 00:48:32,084
Where's the police? What
the hell are they waiting for?!

450
00:48:58,102 --> 00:48:59,739
Christ, no!

451
00:49:00,237 --> 00:49:01,237
They're getting away!

452
00:49:01,639 --> 00:49:03,242
What the hell are
the police doing?

453
00:49:03,607 --> 00:49:05,676
What the hell are
the police doing?!

454
00:49:06,177 --> 00:49:10,451
<i>Emergency service my ass! Why
did it take you so long to get there?!</i>

455
00:49:11,148 --> 00:49:13,023
Mobile Unit! What a joke!

456
00:49:13,851 --> 00:49:15,522
- Could you please stop shouting?
- No!

457
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:17,923
I'm going to kick
up a stink here!

458
00:49:18,622 --> 00:49:21,464
I want everybody to know
you let them get away!

459
00:49:23,761 --> 00:49:25,796
Either you're incompetent
or in cahoots with them.

460
00:49:26,664 --> 00:49:28,699
- What?
- Somebody warned them!

461
00:49:29,099 --> 00:49:31,634
Who could have done
it? I've been on my own!

462
00:49:31,936 --> 00:49:33,175
I acted on my own!

463
00:49:33,370 --> 00:49:34,973
The tip-off must
have come from here.

464
00:49:35,139 --> 00:49:36,378
You better watch your mouth.

465
00:49:37,007 --> 00:49:40,678
You people know who the
fences and arms dealers are!

466
00:49:41,479 --> 00:49:43,514
All you have to do
is put them in jail,

467
00:49:44,048 --> 00:49:45,457
but you hold on to them instead.

468
00:49:46,116 --> 00:49:50,356
Because when there's dead bodies involved,
they're the ones you seek information from.

469
00:49:51,021 --> 00:49:52,158
That's enough!

470
00:49:54,191 --> 00:49:58,226
Do you realise that you are in this
room to cooperate with the police?

471
00:49:59,497 --> 00:50:02,668
Know your place and don't
forget who you are talking to.

472
00:50:03,567 --> 00:50:05,874
I can lock you up for
insulting public order,

473
00:50:06,637 --> 00:50:09,172
and it is not inconceivable
that I will do so sooner or later.

474
00:50:12,243 --> 00:50:16,517
You must understand that the
underworld is well organised.

475
00:50:17,748 --> 00:50:20,192
They have both money and means.

476
00:50:21,585 --> 00:50:24,824
And they may be able to intercept
our radio messages to the patrol cars.

477
00:50:26,490 --> 00:50:28,866
What are you going to do to
the owner of the warehouse?

478
00:50:30,895 --> 00:50:32,930
We can't arrest people
without evidence.

479
00:50:34,265 --> 00:50:35,265
Evidence?

480
00:50:35,933 --> 00:50:38,172
I saw them delivering those
weapons with my own eyes!

481
00:50:38,335 --> 00:50:39,710
There must be
an arsenal in there!

482
00:50:40,271 --> 00:50:42,374
I recognised the three
who robbed the post office!

483
00:50:42,773 --> 00:50:45,944
But sure, you probably think they were
fooling around, playing cops and robbers!

484
00:50:46,343 --> 00:50:47,684
What I say doesn't count, huh?

485
00:50:48,078 --> 00:50:50,419
You cannot take justice
into your own hands!

486
00:50:50,748 --> 00:50:53,283
You'll end up hurting
yourself or others!

487
00:50:55,052 --> 00:50:57,928
I'm tired of entrusting my life to
people who don't give a damn about me!

488
00:50:58,122 --> 00:51:01,691
Tired of continuing to suffer and being
a good, meek and compliant citizen!

489
00:51:05,462 --> 00:51:06,769
The state is like a deity.

490
00:51:07,231 --> 00:51:10,698
We owe it everything, and
it gives us nothing in return!

491
00:51:11,235 --> 00:51:13,542
No use playing the
victim, the blame is on us!

492
00:51:13,737 --> 00:51:15,806
Every nation has the
government it deserves!

493
00:51:16,140 --> 00:51:18,140
What do you think you
are solving with a gun?

494
00:51:19,276 --> 00:51:21,583
What do you think you are
going to solve by doing nothing?

495
00:51:21,879 --> 00:51:23,754
You are deluded if you
think you are going...

496
00:51:24,048 --> 00:51:26,117
... to change anything by
playing the lone vigilante!

497
00:51:26,450 --> 00:51:28,087
Carlo! You better
put on a wool jumper,

498
00:51:28,586 --> 00:51:30,621
the marble slabs at the
morgue are rather chilly!

499
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:34,568
Hey! Who are you?!

500
00:51:36,493 --> 00:51:37,561
Get out! Out!

501
00:51:39,563 --> 00:51:41,063
Hey, this is a misunderstanding.

502
00:51:42,299 --> 00:51:43,970
I'm serious about that girl.

503
00:51:45,069 --> 00:51:46,603
I mean, it's not
like she's underage.

504
00:51:47,805 --> 00:51:50,442
Besides, she started it.

505
00:51:54,945 --> 00:51:55,945
Who the hell are you?!

506
00:51:56,513 --> 00:51:58,116
Her father? Brother?

507
00:51:59,083 --> 00:52:00,083
Husband?

508
00:52:00,484 --> 00:52:01,825
Why are you so pissed off?

509
00:52:02,686 --> 00:52:04,323
I get it, you're
a police officer.

510
00:52:04,588 --> 00:52:06,929
This stuff ain't mine,
it belongs to... Damn!

511
00:52:08,459 --> 00:52:09,868
Get dressed, you're
coming with me.

512
00:52:12,763 --> 00:52:15,104
Do it again and the police will
get your pictures tonight.

513
00:52:15,933 --> 00:52:18,434
So you're the
scummy blackmailer!

514
00:52:20,204 --> 00:52:21,704
Dammit...

515
00:52:22,940 --> 00:52:24,008
I should have known.

516
00:52:28,012 --> 00:52:30,683
You've been tormenting me
with those phone calls for a week.

517
00:52:31,515 --> 00:52:35,323
I got those guns for you, and even
put in touch with those three folks.

518
00:52:35,653 --> 00:52:37,028
What the hell you
need more, I ask?

519
00:52:37,354 --> 00:52:38,661
- The names.
- What?

520
00:52:39,623 --> 00:52:42,862
Give me the names and whereabouts of those
three, and you'll have the negatives.

521
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:44,494
You're nuts.

522
00:52:45,162 --> 00:52:48,663
Rat them out and you'll end up at the bottom
of the sea with a rock 'round your neck.

523
00:52:49,233 --> 00:52:51,143
- Give me their identities.
- I don't know them.

524
00:52:51,635 --> 00:52:52,976
It's the truth, l
never met them!

525
00:52:54,538 --> 00:52:56,209
All right, we'll
find them together.

526
00:52:56,507 --> 00:52:57,712
Get dressed and let's go.

527
00:52:59,243 --> 00:53:00,414
Absolutely no way.

528
00:53:00,878 --> 00:53:01,981
So, what you want me to do?

529
00:53:02,746 --> 00:53:05,019
I want those three, get some
ideas and do it pronto.

530
00:53:06,417 --> 00:53:09,827
I had my last idea so long ago I can't
even remember what it was about.

531
00:53:10,254 --> 00:53:11,663
Stop talking like a jackass.

532
00:53:12,589 --> 00:53:14,999
at least I'm not planning to
act like one, like you are.

533
00:53:15,325 --> 00:53:17,928
Shut up and think of the quickest
way to get in touch with them.

534
00:53:18,362 --> 00:53:20,169
Boy, thinking sure
gives me a headache...

535
00:53:20,497 --> 00:53:22,770
I'll give you a right one if
you don't start cooperating.

536
00:53:31,075 --> 00:53:32,848
Here we are. Come with me.

537
00:53:41,852 --> 00:53:44,296
Hey, where are we going?

538
00:53:45,089 --> 00:53:46,589
To see Mrs. Cavallo.

539
00:53:48,759 --> 00:53:51,964
- Who's Mrs. Cavallo?
- Gino Cavallo's wife, ever heard of him?

540
00:53:55,099 --> 00:53:57,236
Gino Cavallo is the
best robber in all of Italy.

541
00:53:58,402 --> 00:54:01,039
She became a
snitch after his arrest.

542
00:54:01,739 --> 00:54:04,944
A real lady, she
knows everybody.

543
00:54:05,943 --> 00:54:08,819
She's always willing
to help a friend in need.

544
00:54:11,148 --> 00:54:13,058
Behave accordingly, huh?

545
00:54:20,224 --> 00:54:22,134
Good morning,
Ma'am! Remember me?

546
00:54:22,593 --> 00:54:23,593
I'm Tommy.

547
00:54:24,828 --> 00:54:26,635
Yeah, I do remember you.

548
00:54:41,512 --> 00:54:42,512
So...

549
00:54:45,149 --> 00:54:46,320
What will it be, handsome?

550
00:54:46,850 --> 00:54:48,350
What can I do for you?

551
00:54:53,123 --> 00:54:56,658
You see, Ma'am, this friend
of mine is in a bit of a pickle.

552
00:54:56,994 --> 00:55:00,370
- We could use your assistance.
- Something special?

553
00:55:01,098 --> 00:55:02,132
Well, in a way...

554
00:55:03,133 --> 00:55:05,770
It's something we'd
like to keep quiet.

555
00:55:13,110 --> 00:55:14,281
Follow me.

556
00:55:19,483 --> 00:55:20,517
Go on.

557
00:55:21,118 --> 00:55:23,789
She doesn't want to snitch in
front of too many people, you know.

558
00:55:35,399 --> 00:55:37,070
So, what's the matter?

559
00:55:39,002 --> 00:55:40,980
- I'm looking for somebody.
- Oh, well...

560
00:55:42,239 --> 00:55:44,512
I guess you just found the
person you were looking for.

561
00:55:45,209 --> 00:55:47,244
Take off your
clothes, pretty boy.

562
00:55:48,078 --> 00:55:51,352
Now listen, I'm looking for somebody
else and I don't have time for this.

563
00:55:51,548 --> 00:55:53,583
- Tommy said that...
- What's wrong with you?

564
00:55:54,184 --> 00:55:56,821
- That rotten bastard!
- Where are you going?!

565
00:55:58,021 --> 00:56:01,056
I'm a professional,
you stupid idiot!

566
00:56:07,231 --> 00:56:08,436
The steering wheel lock!

567
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:31,220
Right.

568
00:56:31,622 --> 00:56:34,566
What have those guys done to
you? Why are you trying to find them?

569
00:56:35,125 --> 00:56:37,535
- Mind your business.
- Oh, it's my business alright!

570
00:56:39,763 --> 00:56:41,104
They'll kill me if
I swindle them.

571
00:56:42,366 --> 00:56:43,400
Stop the car.

572
00:56:44,935 --> 00:56:46,935
Use that phone
booth to call them.

573
00:57:08,458 --> 00:57:09,458
Your change.

574
00:57:19,569 --> 00:57:21,774
It's Tommy. I need an answer.

575
00:57:26,944 --> 00:57:27,944
All right.

576
00:57:30,948 --> 00:57:34,085
They're suspicious. They want to
know who you are before doing anything.

577
00:57:34,685 --> 00:57:35,753
Yeah, I bet they do.

578
00:57:36,186 --> 00:57:38,186
They said to wait for
them at the gasometer.

579
00:57:45,462 --> 00:57:47,462
I told you, they won't show up!

580
00:57:47,798 --> 00:57:48,935
They're too suspicious!

581
00:57:52,035 --> 00:57:53,513
Come on, let's get out of here.

582
00:57:55,272 --> 00:57:56,875
Why do you want to
go through with this?!

583
00:57:57,874 --> 00:57:59,681
Why do you want to
keep being a criminal?

584
00:58:02,312 --> 00:58:04,847
You think I got a
calling or something?

585
00:58:07,718 --> 00:58:09,696
There wasn't enough
to eat in my house.

586
00:58:10,554 --> 00:58:14,555
Sure, I stole, but in my
situation you would have too.

587
00:58:16,326 --> 00:58:17,826
You could have found a job.

588
00:58:18,795 --> 00:58:23,239
And who would want to hire a kid
who entered juvenile detention at 13?

589
00:58:24,201 --> 00:58:25,735
That was the only
school I went to.

590
00:58:26,169 --> 00:58:27,647
First year: car theft.

591
00:58:27,804 --> 00:58:29,373
Second: house breaking.

592
00:58:29,706 --> 00:58:31,547
Third: lockpicking
and breaking windows.

593
00:58:32,476 --> 00:58:35,852
Next time I'll go to prison I'll
prepare a thesis on armed robbery.

594
00:58:36,980 --> 00:58:38,719
All paid for by the state.

595
00:58:40,584 --> 00:58:42,721
No graduation if they
keep you locked up for life.

596
00:58:45,555 --> 00:58:47,726
Nope, they won't get me.

597
00:58:52,662 --> 00:58:56,231
You see, I just need
a couple more jobs.

598
00:58:56,767 --> 00:59:00,075
Nothing too serious on a felony level,
but that would make me a lot of money.

599
00:59:01,338 --> 00:59:05,078
Then I'll open a nice car
repair shop and retire for good.

600
00:59:06,543 --> 00:59:08,180
How much did you manage to save?

601
00:59:09,913 --> 00:59:11,391
Not a single dime.

602
00:59:15,018 --> 00:59:19,462
I only have a single regret, you
know: not being somebody else.

603
00:59:33,603 --> 00:59:35,774
What's that? An
advance for the shop?

604
00:59:36,540 --> 00:59:37,643
In a way.

605
00:59:49,453 --> 00:59:50,453
Hey...

606
00:59:51,321 --> 00:59:52,628
You're a friend.

607
00:59:55,992 --> 01:00:00,300
Now mark my words: forget about
those guys, stop looking for them.

608
01:00:02,833 --> 01:00:04,311
Why are you so eager to die?

609
01:00:04,601 --> 01:00:06,476
Come on, I'll take you home.

610
01:00:09,506 --> 01:00:10,506
Take me to your friends.

611
01:00:12,809 --> 01:00:14,412
You just don't get it, do you?

612
01:00:15,512 --> 01:00:16,512
Let's go.

613
01:00:17,948 --> 01:00:20,755
All right, whatever!
It's your choice!

614
01:00:23,487 --> 01:00:25,158
Why don't you reconsider?

615
01:00:52,149 --> 01:00:53,183
Hey! Watch out!

616
01:00:57,954 --> 01:01:00,159
- What's wrong?
- I think I got a flat tyre.

617
01:01:01,291 --> 01:01:02,291
Where are you going?

618
01:01:02,459 --> 01:01:03,402
Get out!

619
01:01:04,528 --> 01:01:07,301
Step out of the car, let's
have a look at your mug!

620
01:01:09,166 --> 01:01:11,473
Look who's here, what
a nice surprise.

621
01:01:12,302 --> 01:01:14,212
The hero from the post office.

622
01:01:15,071 --> 01:01:17,015
Found us at last, heh?

623
01:01:17,807 --> 01:01:19,751
Must be the kind of guy
who's never satisfied.

624
01:01:20,177 --> 01:01:21,677
He's back for another beating.

625
01:01:22,078 --> 01:01:24,056
All right, we'll deal with
you for good this time.

626
01:01:24,347 --> 01:01:25,347
Bastard!

627
01:03:21,197 --> 01:03:23,868
<i>Now mark my words: forget about
those guys, stop looking for them.</i>

628
01:03:24,367 --> 01:03:25,674
Why are you so eager to die?

629
01:03:26,036 --> 01:03:27,536
<i>You think this is the wild west?</i>

630
01:03:28,004 --> 01:03:31,039
Bandits ride into town and you put
your star on before blazing them away?

631
01:03:31,374 --> 01:03:34,318
This kind of criminals are armed
and dangerous, not to be provoked.

632
01:03:34,711 --> 01:03:36,189
<i>Very unwise of you to resist.</i>

633
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:17,891
Relax, it's me.

634
01:04:21,024 --> 01:04:24,093
I know, you're right, but I didn't
think they'd beat you to a pulp.

635
01:04:24,527 --> 01:04:26,027
Come on, time to
get away from here.

636
01:04:26,696 --> 01:04:27,935
Let's go, come on!

637
01:04:29,199 --> 01:04:30,677
What are you
waiting for? Hurry up!

638
01:04:33,403 --> 01:04:34,403
Come on.

639
01:04:36,740 --> 01:04:38,684
Good, like this.

640
01:04:43,413 --> 01:04:45,050
They've really done
a number on you.

641
01:04:46,383 --> 01:04:47,758
Come on, let's move.

642
01:04:48,551 --> 01:04:50,029
Don't worry, I'm holding you.

643
01:05:12,609 --> 01:05:13,609
Crap!

644
01:05:15,378 --> 01:05:17,651
Get up! If they find
out we're done for!

645
01:05:18,782 --> 01:05:20,419
Get moving or I'm
leavin' you here, mate.

646
01:05:23,153 --> 01:05:24,790
They mustn't
know I set you free.

647
01:05:31,661 --> 01:05:32,934
Why are you helping me?

648
01:05:33,229 --> 01:05:36,105
Because I've never killed anyone
and I don't want you on my conscience.

649
01:05:36,766 --> 01:05:37,971
Move your ass now.

650
01:05:38,735 --> 01:05:39,735
Let's go.

651
01:05:45,341 --> 01:05:47,012
Come on, you can do it.

652
01:08:33,810 --> 01:08:36,413
No! No! No! Don't!

653
01:08:48,958 --> 01:08:49,958
Stop!

654
01:08:53,496 --> 01:08:54,496
Damn...

655
01:09:01,504 --> 01:09:02,879
What are we gonna
do if he's dead?

656
01:09:04,874 --> 01:09:06,977
I told you things
would end ugly!

657
01:09:11,381 --> 01:09:12,688
Look at what you've done!

658
01:09:17,387 --> 01:09:20,456
Well, talk about an
upstanding citizen.

659
01:09:23,493 --> 01:09:24,868
Go fuck yourself, mate.

660
01:09:25,128 --> 01:09:26,628
To say I almost
believed your crap.

661
01:09:26,963 --> 01:09:29,964
If all honest people are like
you, give me prison any day!

662
01:09:34,070 --> 01:09:36,048
Now what? You thinking
of goin' to the cops?

663
01:09:36,572 --> 01:09:39,914
"Good morning, gentlemen, I just
offed one of the post office robbers!"

664
01:09:40,677 --> 01:09:42,177
That's gonna be your next move?

665
01:09:42,879 --> 01:09:45,516
How you goin' to prove it's one
of the guys who took you hostage?

666
01:09:45,682 --> 01:09:46,989
You got nothing to show!

667
01:09:49,686 --> 01:09:50,823
You're in deep shit, mate.

668
01:09:55,758 --> 01:09:57,599
- Both of us.
- No way!

669
01:09:58,161 --> 01:10:02,401
If you're thinking of using me as a
witness I'm gonna vanish into thin air!

670
01:10:03,066 --> 01:10:05,873
You don't have those negatives
anymore, so good luck blackmailing me!

671
01:10:06,436 --> 01:10:09,346
Nice way of showing me your
gratitude for saving your skin, by the way!

672
01:10:11,941 --> 01:10:15,215
You're going to prison if the guy's
dead, but the others will remain free!

673
01:10:18,448 --> 01:10:19,755
Wanna know what'll happen next?

674
01:10:20,083 --> 01:10:22,561
They'll bribe some inmate
to ice you in the slammer!

675
01:10:23,686 --> 01:10:25,459
You'll end up
like a proper twat!

676
01:10:26,022 --> 01:10:27,397
GALLIERA HOSPITAL

677
01:10:29,959 --> 01:10:32,698
Zilch! He's nowhere to be found.

678
01:10:33,629 --> 01:10:38,073
I even asked a mate who works at the
morgue: no new arrivals, nothing at all.

679
01:10:38,568 --> 01:10:40,102
That son of a bitch's gone.

680
01:10:42,105 --> 01:10:46,913
- Maybe his friends hid the body.
- For the nice memories? It'd be nonsense!

681
01:10:47,310 --> 01:10:49,617
The body's hot evidence,
they'd ditch it right away.

682
01:10:50,313 --> 01:10:56,053
They would have had it found immediately,
perhaps disfigured and unidentifiable.

683
01:11:00,656 --> 01:11:03,134
The guy's still alive,
mark my words.

684
01:11:04,660 --> 01:11:06,433
He ain't six feet under yet.

685
01:11:09,899 --> 01:11:12,240
Hey, stop making that
face. I told you, he's alive!

686
01:11:13,469 --> 01:11:14,469
Have a laugh!

687
01:11:16,739 --> 01:11:17,739
Here, have a smoke.

688
01:11:19,742 --> 01:11:22,243
You serious about that
advance to buy the shop?

689
01:11:23,479 --> 01:11:24,854
I know my way around cars.

690
01:11:26,349 --> 01:11:28,690
One whiff of an engine and I
can tell what's wrong with it.

691
01:11:29,819 --> 01:11:31,592
And one look's enough
for a full check-up!

692
01:11:32,822 --> 01:11:34,857
Hey, I'm serious. We'd
be great business partners.

693
01:11:39,362 --> 01:11:42,101
- Hey, isn't that your house?
- Yes!

694
01:11:42,465 --> 01:11:44,966
What's up with all those
firefighters and cops in front of it?

695
01:11:45,501 --> 01:11:47,706
Wait, stay here. I'll go.

696
01:12:14,697 --> 01:12:16,334
- What happened?
- It was them!

697
01:12:16,732 --> 01:12:18,039
They found out where you live!

698
01:12:19,569 --> 01:12:21,206
Keep your head down!

699
01:12:25,908 --> 01:12:27,249
Those sons of bitches...

700
01:12:27,877 --> 01:12:29,582
They wanted to make
another number on you.

701
01:12:33,516 --> 01:12:35,653
They wanted it to
hurt, the bastards.

702
01:12:36,586 --> 01:12:38,427
Pouring a petrol tin
under your door...

703
01:12:38,754 --> 01:12:40,254
You'd be done for
if you stayed home.

704
01:12:42,525 --> 01:12:44,332
Those guys are gonna
hunt you down now.

705
01:12:45,561 --> 01:12:46,834
Damn cops being useless.

706
01:12:47,163 --> 01:12:48,834
They should nail those bastards!

707
01:12:49,365 --> 01:12:50,899
What's their names? Tell me!

708
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:52,200
I swear, I dunno.

709
01:12:53,202 --> 01:12:55,077
I only saw them when
they beat you up.

710
01:13:01,043 --> 01:13:02,577
I reckon you should
turn yourself in.

711
01:13:02,879 --> 01:13:05,721
That's the only way you can get
some protection and stay alive.

712
01:13:07,283 --> 01:13:09,454
They'll find me everywhere
if they really want me dead!

713
01:13:09,752 --> 01:13:11,093
You said so yourself,
didn't you?

714
01:13:14,423 --> 01:13:16,060
Anyway, it's a matter
between me and them.

715
01:13:16,225 --> 01:13:18,225
It's not fair for you to get
involved because of me.

716
01:13:18,728 --> 01:13:21,933
- You better disappear.
- And you're suggesting that now?!

717
01:13:22,932 --> 01:13:25,535
You should have said it before
getting me into this mess!

718
01:13:27,069 --> 01:13:29,410
- What are you going to do?
- Let's stick together.

719
01:13:30,473 --> 01:13:32,076
- All the way?
- Heh.

720
01:13:35,544 --> 01:13:38,545
Come with me, you need a shower
and a change of clothes.

721
01:13:39,415 --> 01:13:40,415
You reek.

722
01:13:42,919 --> 01:13:45,420
<i>I recorded five sequentially
numbered tapes.</i>

723
01:13:45,755 --> 01:13:51,063
<i>The information they contain is to be
released to the press in case I am killed.</i>

724
01:13:51,727 --> 01:13:54,671
- All right, change reels.
- Sure, what title you want on it?

725
01:13:55,131 --> 01:13:57,131
Third reel: "organization
of the underworld."

726
01:13:57,500 --> 01:14:03,001
I'd like to see their faces when they
can't find the reels we didn't record.

727
01:14:04,507 --> 01:14:07,008
They'll find the tapes, but
they'll be completely destroyed.

728
01:14:10,813 --> 01:14:11,813
Ready.

729
01:14:13,349 --> 01:14:16,691
As the police know, the
underworld is built on many levels.

730
01:14:21,824 --> 01:14:25,200
Reel four: "connections between
the police and the underworld."

731
01:14:29,131 --> 01:14:30,938
You're gonna unleash pure chaos.

732
01:14:34,170 --> 01:14:35,170
Ready.

733
01:14:36,505 --> 01:14:38,449
I discovered that the
criminal Michele Gambino,

734
01:14:38,774 --> 01:14:43,616
owner of an illegal gambling den, has been
meeting with the three post office robbers.

735
01:14:43,946 --> 01:14:47,856
Their last meeting took place
at the Nautilus Shipyards.

736
01:14:48,351 --> 01:14:50,124
I called the police,
and soon afterwards...

737
01:14:50,353 --> 01:14:52,456
... I saw Gambino and
the others fleeing in a car.

738
01:14:53,322 --> 01:14:56,857
They could only have been informed of the
police's arrival by the police themselves.

739
01:14:57,827 --> 01:15:02,635
<i>The names of the policemen involved with
the underworld can be found in reel five.</i>

740
01:15:21,751 --> 01:15:24,695
Where do we hide these
for the police to find them?

741
01:15:34,997 --> 01:15:35,997
Here.

742
01:15:36,432 --> 01:15:39,274
Poor Leone! He's in for a shock
when he gets back from the weekend!

743
01:15:40,703 --> 01:15:42,112
You're pretty sly, Engineer!

744
01:15:42,538 --> 01:15:43,947
You're going to
cause quite a mess!

745
01:15:44,273 --> 01:15:46,774
I hope so! What would
you do in the police's shoes?

746
01:15:47,276 --> 01:15:50,220
You'd think there were who knows
what revelations on those tapes,

747
01:15:50,713 --> 01:15:52,588
and you'd do your
damnedest to find them!

748
01:15:53,883 --> 01:15:55,020
If you say so.

749
01:15:56,952 --> 01:15:59,555
Shame to leave all this
stuff here, it cost a fortune.

750
01:16:00,356 --> 01:16:02,061
It's a present for the police.

751
01:16:02,958 --> 01:16:04,061
Except this one.

752
01:16:27,917 --> 01:16:29,156
Well? Are they tapes?

753
01:16:29,618 --> 01:16:31,891
Yes, Inspector. They
look like magnetic tapes.

754
01:16:32,154 --> 01:16:34,757
We'd better wait until the
lab confirms this theory.

755
01:16:37,426 --> 01:16:39,767
Hey, who's this guy
that got kidnapped?

756
01:16:40,763 --> 01:16:44,832
It must be someone very important,
considering how worked up everyone is.

757
01:16:45,334 --> 01:16:47,903
Borelli, come here. I've
found two tapes here.

758
01:16:48,137 --> 01:16:49,808
They've burned a
few others over here.

759
01:16:50,106 --> 01:16:52,413
They probably
didn't find these ones.

760
01:16:52,675 --> 01:16:56,949
Perhaps the most compromising
things were on the burned tapes.

761
01:16:57,513 --> 01:17:00,355
I told you, Inspector, last
night everything was in order!

762
01:17:00,749 --> 01:17:04,091
I came in this morning and called
you immediately after finding this chaos!

763
01:17:04,687 --> 01:17:06,631
Did you try to get in
touch with the engineer?

764
01:17:06,822 --> 01:17:08,493
I would have, but
I cannot find him!

765
01:17:08,824 --> 01:17:10,824
He's not home and I
haven't seen him for days!

766
01:17:11,260 --> 01:17:13,965
I mean, he used to call every
now and then, but lately nothing.

767
01:17:14,463 --> 01:17:18,134
Look at this mess, how
am I supposed to work now?

768
01:17:18,434 --> 01:17:19,673
Be careful with the press.

769
01:17:20,102 --> 01:17:21,546
Let's be cautious.

770
01:17:21,871 --> 01:17:23,280
The less we tell
them, the better.

771
01:17:23,672 --> 01:17:25,775
They just can't
wait to stick it to us.

772
01:17:28,277 --> 01:17:29,777
When they find
out it's Antonelli,

773
01:17:30,045 --> 01:17:32,182
they'll connect everything
to the post office robbery.

774
01:17:33,115 --> 01:17:35,388
You know journalists
better than I do.

775
01:17:36,452 --> 01:17:38,623
We do our job, but they
always seem to know everything.

776
01:17:39,788 --> 01:17:41,288
- Who's this?
- Engineer's girlfriend.

777
01:17:41,824 --> 01:17:43,563
What happened?
Tell me, did they...

778
01:17:43,859 --> 01:17:45,700
No, we're convinced he's alive.

779
01:17:46,295 --> 01:17:47,966
- Try to calm down, please.
- Calm down?!

780
01:17:48,230 --> 01:17:50,537
I won't calm down
and I'll shout if I want to!

781
01:17:51,033 --> 01:17:53,306
It's your fault! You
didn't give a damn!

782
01:17:54,370 --> 01:17:57,007
Carlo told you, but
you wouldn't even listen!

783
01:17:58,240 --> 01:17:59,343
It's your fault.

784
01:18:02,244 --> 01:18:03,688
Borelli, you stay here.

785
01:18:04,180 --> 01:18:06,021
See you at the office
when forensics are done.

786
01:18:07,550 --> 01:18:09,585
I want the staff
in for questioning.

787
01:19:15,050 --> 01:19:16,755
- Tommy?
- Yeah, it's me.

788
01:19:25,160 --> 01:19:27,501
- Did anyone see you?
- Mate, I'm not that dumb.

789
01:19:43,112 --> 01:19:44,590
Look! Will you
take a look at this!

790
01:19:47,149 --> 01:19:50,820
- We did it!
- Boy, we sure dropped a bomb!

791
01:19:51,253 --> 01:19:53,094
There's even a
picture of the lab.

792
01:19:53,455 --> 01:19:56,126
Read the title! "Engineer Carlo
Antonelli has been kidnapped!"

793
01:19:56,825 --> 01:19:58,666
- This one?
- No.

794
01:20:03,365 --> 01:20:04,774
Another dummy, huh?

795
01:20:05,768 --> 01:20:08,144
"Is the mysterious disappearance
of Engineer Antonelli...

796
01:20:08,437 --> 01:20:10,642
... caused by murder or kidnap?"

797
01:20:12,174 --> 01:20:13,345
- You read this one?
- Yes.

798
01:20:14,610 --> 01:20:17,111
"Antonelli was collecting
evidence of complicity...

799
01:20:17,446 --> 01:20:19,390
... between the police
and the underworld."

800
01:20:19,648 --> 01:20:21,853
- Well, talk about good news.
- Yes, yes.

801
01:20:23,452 --> 01:20:26,794
Lippi's asking if he can send out
the men for that operation we planned.

802
01:20:27,890 --> 01:20:28,890
Yeah.

803
01:20:30,326 --> 01:20:32,827
We must search
every inch of the city.

804
01:20:33,996 --> 01:20:37,906
Find dealers, pimps, gambling
den owners and fencers.

805
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:42,640
<i>Scare up bail jumpers, sooner or
later somebody will give us a lead.</i>

806
01:20:43,038 --> 01:20:45,141
<i>Tell Lippi permits
are suspended.</i>

807
01:20:45,841 --> 01:20:49,080
<i>I want every available officer. 24/7.</i>

808
01:20:50,145 --> 01:20:51,213
<i>The police have gone wild!</i>

809
01:20:52,047 --> 01:20:53,047
<i>Everyone's gone crazy!</i>

810
01:20:54,516 --> 01:20:57,323
People are under pressure, you
wouldn't believe the chaos out there.

811
01:20:58,754 --> 01:21:00,493
Things aren't getting
nice for those three.

812
01:21:01,090 --> 01:21:03,397
Word has spread that
it's pivotal to nail them.

813
01:21:04,927 --> 01:21:08,530
- Did the police identify them?
- Police? The underworld!

814
01:21:09,064 --> 01:21:13,440
They've decided those three are too hot,
so it's time to throw them at the cops.

815
01:21:14,036 --> 01:21:15,514
It's a way to quiet things down.

816
01:21:16,405 --> 01:21:18,178
You bastard, you
gotta help me out.

817
01:21:19,441 --> 01:21:22,442
That so? But I helped you
out when you needed me!

818
01:21:24,346 --> 01:21:25,414
It's your turn now!

819
01:21:26,448 --> 01:21:27,892
What? What?!

820
01:21:29,051 --> 01:21:30,256
I'll make you pay for this!

821
01:21:32,221 --> 01:21:33,858
Hello? Hello?

822
01:21:34,556 --> 01:21:35,931
Son of a whore...

823
01:21:36,392 --> 01:21:38,131
Why did you come to me?

824
01:21:40,529 --> 01:21:42,098
- Bourbon?
- No, thanks.

825
01:21:42,631 --> 01:21:45,075
Some friends suggested
me to come here and, well...

826
01:21:45,434 --> 01:21:48,776
Friends? What friends?
You don't have any.

827
01:21:49,104 --> 01:21:51,048
Hey, I'm staying
here, understand?

828
01:21:51,573 --> 01:21:53,551
Until you do something
to help me out.

829
01:21:53,942 --> 01:21:55,476
Oh, swell...

830
01:22:00,082 --> 01:22:02,492
Miss? Call the police.

831
01:22:04,653 --> 01:22:08,427
This ain't over, I'll show you!

832
01:22:09,291 --> 01:22:11,291
Desolated, nothing I can
do. You're a marked man.

833
01:22:11,627 --> 01:22:13,968
- But I...
- Friends and foes, all looking for you.

834
01:22:14,263 --> 01:22:16,832
I don't want to end up in the
river with a rock around my neck.

835
01:22:17,599 --> 01:22:21,441
I'm sorry, but you'll have to ask somebody
else to take your nuts outta the fire.

836
01:22:22,938 --> 01:22:28,280
Now listen' if I make it you and those
other assholes won't get away with this.

837
01:22:28,844 --> 01:22:30,322
Yeah, yeah, you'll show me.

838
01:22:31,079 --> 01:22:34,489
But if the other fellows find you first,
you know what they gonna do with this gun?

839
01:22:34,750 --> 01:22:36,489
They'll shove it right
up your butthole!

840
01:22:42,658 --> 01:22:45,102
Freeze! Don't move and
don't touch those tables!

841
01:22:48,530 --> 01:22:50,508
Over there, block those exits!

842
01:22:54,369 --> 01:22:56,347
You finally up for
that pool game?

843
01:22:56,672 --> 01:23:00,377
The time for games is over. Put on your
coat and move it, you're coming with us!

844
01:23:05,113 --> 01:23:07,818
- There he is!
- Look over here, Mr. Gambino!

845
01:23:08,217 --> 01:23:11,161
- Back off.
- Peace and goodwill, boys!

846
01:23:11,553 --> 01:23:13,860
Don't you worry,
it's just a false alarm.

847
01:23:14,189 --> 01:23:16,496
- Make way.
- One more photo!

848
01:23:16,725 --> 01:23:19,532
Keep snapping! Look
over here, Mr. Gambino!

849
01:23:20,162 --> 01:23:22,367
Look over here!
One more picture!

850
01:23:45,187 --> 01:23:46,596
Who are you? What do you want?

851
01:23:48,156 --> 01:23:50,895
- Relax, I'm a friend of Carlo's.
- Carlo's?

852
01:23:53,662 --> 01:23:58,106
I couldn't let you know or
you'd have been in danger too.

853
01:24:00,068 --> 01:24:03,103
All right, but now
that I know everything,

854
01:24:03,705 --> 01:24:05,944
don't expect me to help
you in this madness.

855
01:24:08,210 --> 01:24:11,620
I had no choice, and it was the
only way to get the police moving.

856
01:24:12,080 --> 01:24:13,955
It'll be over for me if
they don't catch them.

857
01:24:14,383 --> 01:24:17,520
- No turning back now.
- And if the police catch you?

858
01:24:18,353 --> 01:24:20,797
They could jail you
for simulating a crime.

859
01:24:21,390 --> 01:24:23,095
It's a risk I have to take.

860
01:24:23,525 --> 01:24:26,367
The police wouldn't act
unless it's a noisy case.

861
01:24:29,898 --> 01:24:32,740
I can't believe you don't understand
how absurd this situation is!

862
01:24:34,603 --> 01:24:36,774
Look at what they've
done to you, Carlo.

863
01:24:37,773 --> 01:24:39,808
You must forget about all this.

864
01:24:40,309 --> 01:24:41,809
Let's move to another city.

865
01:24:43,111 --> 01:24:44,486
I beg you, Carlo.

866
01:24:45,981 --> 01:24:47,049
Do it for me.

867
01:24:49,051 --> 01:24:50,051
It's no use, Barbara.

868
01:24:50,786 --> 01:24:52,821
It's not just a personal
matter anymore.

869
01:24:53,422 --> 01:24:56,491
I must go all the way now or I wouldn't
be able to live in peace with myself.

870
01:24:56,758 --> 01:24:58,292
I'd be ashamed of myself.

871
01:25:01,096 --> 01:25:02,096
I love you.

872
01:25:04,132 --> 01:25:05,507
Of course you do.

873
01:25:06,234 --> 01:25:08,735
You love me yet you're doing
everything to get yourself killed.

874
01:25:09,304 --> 01:25:12,680
That's how it'll end, Carlo, and
you want me to sit down and wait.

875
01:25:14,843 --> 01:25:15,843
Help me.

876
01:25:18,313 --> 01:25:22,348
I put myself in this, but I need
a reason to come out of it alive.

877
01:25:24,186 --> 01:25:29,290
<i>The disappearance of Engineer Antonelli
is still shrouded in complete mystery.</i>

878
01:25:29,825 --> 01:25:33,826
<i>During their operation, the police have
discovered many warehouses of stolen goods,</i>

879
01:25:34,162 --> 01:25:35,969
<i>as well as arresting
some fencers.</i>

880
01:25:36,298 --> 01:25:39,276
<i>Roadblocks led to the arrest
of several convicted criminals.</i>

881
01:25:39,534 --> 01:25:42,603
<i>However, there seems
to be no real lead so far.</i>

882
01:25:43,171 --> 01:25:46,115
Does your car repair
shop offer still stand?

883
01:25:46,541 --> 01:25:47,678
Of course.

884
01:25:48,043 --> 01:25:49,282
Prick up your ears, then.

885
01:25:49,878 --> 01:25:51,185
I'm on the right track now.

886
01:25:51,947 --> 01:25:54,220
I can get you the names
and addresses of those three.

887
01:25:54,883 --> 01:25:58,384
Their fathers' details don't matter,
considering they're sons of bitches.

888
01:25:59,287 --> 01:26:01,162
Who's going to give
you the information?

889
01:26:01,690 --> 01:26:03,327
Somebody who
was in the business.

890
01:26:03,625 --> 01:26:05,898
- When?
- Later.

891
01:26:06,695 --> 01:26:08,832
I'll be meeting him
in a couple hours.

892
01:26:09,631 --> 01:26:11,370
- I'm coming with you.
- No, Engineer.

893
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:15,069
I have to go alone, otherwise
this guy won't spill the beans.

894
01:26:22,377 --> 01:26:24,321
All right, but be careful.

895
01:26:26,048 --> 01:26:29,322
You be careful, otherwise
who will I open the shop with?

896
01:27:19,768 --> 01:27:22,246
- Tommy, is that you?
- Yeah, it's me.

897
01:27:24,706 --> 01:27:26,206
- You alone?
- Yes.

898
01:27:28,410 --> 01:27:29,717
Yeah, I'm alone.

899
01:27:30,879 --> 01:27:31,913
No, I don't believe you!

900
01:27:33,248 --> 01:27:35,453
You have my word.
I'm alone, I swear!

901
01:27:36,051 --> 01:27:37,620
You're with them!
You brought them here!

902
01:27:38,253 --> 01:27:39,628
Why do you keep
trying to screw me?

903
01:27:39,821 --> 01:27:41,662
You're not a friend,
you're just a...

904
01:27:42,991 --> 01:27:43,991
Tommy!

905
01:28:12,020 --> 01:28:13,429
Come on out, you bastard!

906
01:28:14,956 --> 01:28:15,956
No! No!

907
01:28:16,625 --> 01:28:18,125
We'll send him in
one piece at a time!

908
01:28:18,460 --> 01:28:19,494
Carlo! Carlo!

909
01:28:20,328 --> 01:28:21,328
Help me!

910
01:28:23,165 --> 01:28:26,200
I didn't... I didn't...

911
01:28:26,535 --> 01:28:27,876
Carlo, I didn't set you up!

912
01:28:28,203 --> 01:28:29,703
I swear I didn't! Help me!

913
01:28:30,605 --> 01:28:32,776
Come on out, you filthy bastard!

914
01:28:39,281 --> 01:28:40,281
Carlo!

915
01:28:41,316 --> 01:28:44,123
Carlo, kill them!
Blast them away!

916
01:28:44,686 --> 01:28:46,630
Blast these sons
of bitches to hell!

917
01:30:29,758 --> 01:30:30,963
Lookin' for us?

918
01:30:34,496 --> 01:30:37,303
The rat's here, now
the cats can play!

919
01:30:37,899 --> 01:30:40,741
Hold it! Where do
you think you're going?

920
01:31:59,547 --> 01:32:01,252
Stop squirming, you bastard!

921
01:32:03,251 --> 01:32:04,251
Move it!

922
01:32:23,104 --> 01:32:24,207
Tommy...

923
01:32:33,048 --> 01:32:36,958
Come on out, bastard, or
we'll kill him one bullet at a time!

924
01:32:40,021 --> 01:32:41,521
Come on out already!

925
01:32:42,057 --> 01:32:43,432
Save your friend!

926
01:32:48,763 --> 01:32:51,207
Come out, you're not
getting out of here alive!

927
01:32:51,633 --> 01:32:53,372
Come on out, asshole!

928
01:32:54,936 --> 01:32:56,539
Hey! Come on out!

929
01:32:59,941 --> 01:33:01,385
You heard them! Come on out!

930
01:33:02,911 --> 01:33:05,287
They'll kill me if you
don't do something!

931
01:33:11,286 --> 01:33:12,593
Run, Tommy! Run!

932
01:33:52,760 --> 01:33:54,135
Please! Mum!

933
01:33:58,466 --> 01:33:59,966
Mum...

934
01:34:03,138 --> 01:34:04,172
No...

935
01:34:05,306 --> 01:34:06,306
No!

936
01:34:13,148 --> 01:34:14,148
Tommy!

937
01:36:04,425 --> 01:36:05,903
You bastard!

938
01:37:04,319 --> 01:37:05,319
Tommy!

939
01:37:09,324 --> 01:37:11,961
You see? We showed them...

940
01:37:14,228 --> 01:37:15,467
You really did.

941
01:37:26,307 --> 01:37:29,342
Do I deserve a shop or not?

942
01:37:30,511 --> 01:37:31,511
You bet.

943
01:37:33,581 --> 01:37:36,388
We are going to open the
biggest car repair that ever existed!

944
01:37:36,884 --> 01:37:38,691
We'll put in lots of sports cars,

945
01:37:39,153 --> 01:37:41,153
and you'll always be
there to test and fix them!

946
01:37:41,689 --> 01:37:43,530
We'll have so many clients!

947
01:37:44,425 --> 01:37:46,198
Everybody will want
Tommy to fix their car!

948
01:37:47,595 --> 01:37:48,595
Damn...

949
01:37:50,031 --> 01:37:52,372
You found me a
fine looking shop.

950
01:37:52,934 --> 01:37:54,378
It looks swell...

951
01:37:54,936 --> 01:37:56,675
Just the way I wanted it.

952
01:37:57,705 --> 01:37:59,376
It feels like a dream...

953
01:38:00,041 --> 01:38:02,576
Yeah, and we'll fill
it with luxury cars!

954
01:38:04,178 --> 01:38:07,088
So many that we won't
know where to put them!

955
01:38:09,951 --> 01:38:14,691
We'll put the sports
cars over there.

956
01:38:16,224 --> 01:38:17,895
The luxury ones will go there!

957
01:38:20,128 --> 01:38:22,867
We'll have a lift
to the upper floors!

958
01:38:25,032 --> 01:38:26,703
And an office with a big staff!

959
01:38:27,201 --> 01:38:29,201
At night the shop
will be floodlit!

960
01:38:30,371 --> 01:38:32,281
And it will always be
packed with pretty girls!

961
01:38:33,808 --> 01:38:35,479
Do you like it, Tommy?

962
01:38:44,285 --> 01:38:47,593
Christ!

963
01:38:53,094 --> 01:38:55,765
<i>The police intervention
saved your life.</i>

964
01:38:56,297 --> 01:38:59,502
<i>The officers killed your
captors during a shootout.</i>

965
01:38:59,801 --> 01:39:01,642
<i>That's going to be
the official story?</i>

966
01:39:01,903 --> 01:39:02,903
<i>It depends on you.</i>

967
01:39:03,137 --> 01:39:06,479
Sign this paper
and you're free to go.

968
01:39:07,475 --> 01:39:11,112
- No charges, no arrests.
- You feeling generous?

969
01:39:11,446 --> 01:39:13,424
- Aiming for a promotion, maybe?
- No.

970
01:39:14,649 --> 01:39:16,456
I'm doing what I've
been instructed to do.

971
01:39:20,822 --> 01:39:23,664
We can't risk other hotshots
to follow your footsteps.

972
01:39:25,426 --> 01:39:27,631
If citizens start taking the
law into their own hands,

973
01:39:28,296 --> 01:39:31,535
who will distinguish honest
people from dishonest ones?

974
01:39:31,999 --> 01:39:34,306
This is the best
solution, believe me.

975
01:39:35,136 --> 01:39:36,636
I hope you'll finally
understand it.

976
01:39:43,611 --> 01:39:46,316
At the bottom of the
statement there's a declaration...

977
01:39:46,781 --> 01:39:51,350
... that the captors forced you to
make those statements against police.

978
01:39:55,456 --> 01:39:56,490
Sign.

979
01:39:56,891 --> 01:40:01,028
And don't forget we can gather new
evidence at any time to re-open the case.

980
01:40:03,064 --> 01:40:04,064
Against you.

981
01:40:14,342 --> 01:40:17,547
I'm insured! But they cover damages,
they're not the ones who have to defend me!

982
01:40:17,879 --> 01:40:22,687
Police are supposed to do
it, even your posters say so!

983
01:40:23,050 --> 01:40:25,221
You even dared ask me if l
have a permit to carry a gun!

984
01:40:25,586 --> 01:40:28,087
Why don't you ask the same
question to the people who robbed me?

985
01:40:28,356 --> 01:40:32,096
Four times I've been robbed! But you better
pray the lord it doesn't happen anymore!

986
01:40:32,426 --> 01:40:35,063
Next time I'll open fire first,
I don't care against who!

987
01:40:35,563 --> 01:40:39,530
Don't you realise citizens are fed up of
risking their lives every time they go out?

988
01:40:39,867 --> 01:40:42,674
They've had enough
of this! Enough!
