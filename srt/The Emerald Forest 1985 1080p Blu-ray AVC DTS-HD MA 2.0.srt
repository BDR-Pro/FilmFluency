(lively percussive music)

00:01:55,656 --> 00:01:58,950
(children chatter)
(horn honks)

8
00:01:58,951 --> 00:02:00,035
- Be careful.

9
00:02:02,288 --> 00:02:03,122
Tommy!

10
00:02:05,791 --> 00:02:07,459
(chatter in foreign language)

11
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:08,627
Don't do that.

12
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:14,133
(chatter in foreign language)

13
00:02:15,551 --> 00:02:17,553
Oh, look! There's daddy.

14
00:02:18,512 --> 00:02:20,430
- [Tommy] Where?

15
00:02:20,431 --> 00:02:22,266
- [Heather] I see him!

16
00:02:39,867 --> 00:02:42,160
- [Tommy] Where, Daddy?

17
00:02:42,161 --> 00:02:44,788
- [Heather] This thing is getting heavy.

18
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:46,123
- My office.

19
00:02:46,123 --> 00:02:47,165
Right there.

20
00:02:47,166 --> 00:02:48,000
There.

21
00:02:53,756 --> 00:02:56,425
- I can watch you from here when you work.

22
00:02:56,425 --> 00:02:57,676
- Yeah.

23
00:02:57,677 --> 00:03:01,472
But most of the time, I'm
gonna be way out there.

24
00:03:01,472 --> 00:03:04,558
(gentle synth music)

25
00:03:21,575 --> 00:03:23,910
;' Gently down the stream [

26
00:03:23,911 --> 00:03:26,455

27

J Life is but a dream J

28
00:03:28,124 --> 00:03:30,209
- Daddy, when do we get there?

29
00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:31,627
- She said it again, Mom.

30
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:34,004
- What?

31
00:03:35,214 --> 00:03:36,924
I told you, if you say that one more time,

32
00:03:36,924 --> 00:03:38,383
I was gonna strangle you!

33
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:40,052
(Heather giggles)

34
00:03:40,052 --> 00:03:42,471
- I spy with my little eye!

35
00:03:42,471 --> 00:03:43,305
Look.

36
00:03:43,305 --> 00:03:44,931
- Hurray!
- All right!

37
00:03:44,932 --> 00:03:46,099
- Yay!
- Great!

38
00:03:46,934 --> 00:03:48,602
- [Jean] Hallelujah!

39
00:03:50,062 --> 00:03:52,689
- [Tommy] Are all these
guys working for you, Daddy?

40
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:54,566
(Bill laughs)

41
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:57,236
(brakes squeal)

42
00:04:00,156 --> 00:04:02,283
- Hi, Pavio. How's it going?
- Good to see you.

43
00:04:02,283 --> 00:04:04,660
- Ah, you see it's going pretty well.

44
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:06,536
By the way, I would like
you to take a look at

45
00:04:06,537 --> 00:04:08,956
some plans I heard about, no?

46
00:04:08,956 --> 00:04:10,582
- Pavio, this is my wife Jean.

47
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:11,709
- How do you do?
- Hi, how are you?

48
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:12,543
- This is Pavio.

49
00:04:12,543 --> 00:04:15,170
(chatter drowned out by engines)

50
00:04:15,171 --> 00:04:16,172
- Tommy!

51
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:18,757
(engines roar)

52
00:04:20,217 --> 00:04:24,346
We have to clear 10 square
kilometers and level right down.

53
00:04:24,346 --> 00:04:26,222
Going to be some time before your husband

54
00:04:26,223 --> 00:04:28,308
can start pouring concrete.

55
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:30,810
(tree thumps)

56
00:04:31,979 --> 00:04:34,439
- See, the roots on the
trees are not very deep,

57
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,151
so the bulldozer can
just push 'em right down.

58
00:04:37,151 --> 00:04:38,652
- I'm scared.

59
00:04:38,652 --> 00:04:39,486
- I'm not.

60
00:04:42,281 --> 00:04:44,241
(tree crashes)

61
00:04:44,241 --> 00:04:46,284
- One of these days, when
you get a little bigger,

62
00:04:46,285 --> 00:04:48,078
I'll show you how to drive one of those.

63
00:04:48,078 --> 00:04:52,578
- Great!

64
00:04:53,542 --> 00:04:56,127
(engines roar)

65
00:05:00,007 --> 00:05:02,467
- [Bill] Come on. Let's
get something to eat, huh?

66
00:05:06,847 --> 00:05:09,432
(engines roar)

67
00:05:15,356 --> 00:05:17,858
(birds chirp)

68
00:05:35,292 --> 00:05:37,961
(food crunches)

69
00:05:48,889 --> 00:05:50,390
- Where's everything going to be?

70
00:05:51,308 --> 00:05:53,685
- Well, there's a lot
more work to be done.

71
00:05:53,727 --> 00:05:57,647
We gotta clear all these trees here,

72
00:05:57,648 --> 00:06:00,025
all this, all the way down to the river,

73
00:06:00,025 --> 00:06:02,318
before we even can start
construction on the dam.

74
00:06:06,031 --> 00:06:09,576
Over here, we'll put the
town and the airstrip.

75
00:06:09,577 --> 00:06:11,579
(Jean giggles)

76
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:13,664
- It's really gonna be
something, isn't it?

77
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:18,001
- Mommy, is Tommy allowed?

78
00:06:20,087 --> 00:06:20,921
- [Jean] Tommy?

79
00:06:21,797 --> 00:06:23,924
- It's okay, Daddy. Isn't it?

80
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:25,843
- Is it safe?

81
00:06:26,844 --> 00:06:29,221
- [Bill] You just stay
where I can see you, okay?

82
00:06:35,311 --> 00:06:37,938
- Are there any snakes here, Daddy?

83
00:06:42,484 --> 00:06:43,318
- No.

84
00:07:02,963 --> 00:07:05,966
(suspenseful music)

85
00:07:24,652 --> 00:07:26,111
(tribe member chuckles)

86
00:07:26,111 --> 00:07:27,362
- Daddy! Daddy!

87
00:07:28,656 --> 00:07:29,615
Daddy!

88
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:31,199
There's people in there!

89
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,452
- People? What kind of people?

90
00:07:33,452 --> 00:07:34,619
- Smiling people.

91
00:07:35,871 --> 00:07:38,331
- He just wants you to play with him.

92
00:07:38,332 --> 00:07:40,417
(Heather giggles)

93
00:07:40,417 --> 00:07:42,335
- Okay, big boy. Let's go have a look!

94
00:07:43,587 --> 00:07:46,172
All right, come on, come on.
- There, I'll show you!

95
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:50,552
(Tommy giggles)
- Where are they?

96
00:07:50,552 --> 00:07:52,554
Smiling people, huh?

97
00:07:52,554 --> 00:07:54,639
(Tommy laughs)

98
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,474
Come on!

99
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:06,985
I don't see anybody.

100
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:08,362
- They were here.

101
00:08:15,327 --> 00:08:17,912
- All right, come on. Let's go.

102
00:08:24,086 --> 00:08:25,921
Tell you what I'd like to do?

103
00:08:25,921 --> 00:08:28,256
Let's go down to the river
and have a swim, all right?

104
00:08:31,468 --> 00:08:34,554
Tommy, come on! Quit
fooling around, let's go!

105
00:08:34,555 --> 00:08:37,558
(suspenseful music)

106
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:39,643
Tommy!

107
00:08:40,644 --> 00:08:41,978
Get yourself down here!

108
00:08:44,064 --> 00:08:45,315
Come on, Tommy.

109
00:08:46,358 --> 00:08:47,817
I'm not playing around now.

110
00:08:52,448 --> 00:08:55,492
I'm gonna bust your behind
when I get you, son.

111
00:08:55,492 --> 00:08:56,868
(arrow thuds)

112
00:08:56,869 --> 00:09:00,873
(suspenseful music continues)

113
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:01,707
Tommy?

114
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:04,126
Tommy!

115
00:09:05,669 --> 00:09:06,503
Tommy!

116
00:09:07,921 --> 00:09:08,755
Tommy!

117
00:09:09,798 --> 00:09:11,257
(Bill grunts)

118
00:09:11,258 --> 00:09:12,634
Jean!

119
00:09:12,634 --> 00:09:13,468
Jean!

120
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,388
Jean! Get some help!

121
00:09:17,389 --> 00:09:18,890
They've taken Tommy!

122
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:21,560
- What?
- They've taken Tommy!

123
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,144
Just get some help!

124
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:25,814
- [Jean] Help!

125
00:09:25,814 --> 00:09:26,648
Help!

126
00:09:27,608 --> 00:09:30,110
Somebody help me, please!

127
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:32,112
(Jean speaks foreign language)

128
00:09:32,112 --> 00:09:36,612
(leaves rustle)
(Bill grunts and pants)

129
00:09:38,869 --> 00:09:43,369
(workers speak foreign language)

130
00:09:43,373 --> 00:09:47,627
(workers yell in foreign language)

131
00:09:50,547 --> 00:09:54,926
- It's okay.
(Heather whimpers)

132
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:57,763
(leaves rustle)
(Bill grunts)

133
00:09:57,763 --> 00:09:59,181
- [Worker] Tommy!

134
00:10:00,974 --> 00:10:03,810
(birds chirp)
(leaves rustle)

135
00:10:03,811 --> 00:10:06,855
(Bill grunts)

136
00:10:06,855 --> 00:10:09,357
(Bill grunts and pants)

137
00:10:09,358 --> 00:10:10,192
- Tommy!

138
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:13,362
(workers speak foreign language)

139
00:10:13,362 --> 00:10:14,196
- Tommy?

140
00:10:16,323 --> 00:10:17,657
Baby, answer me.

141
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:20,744
Bill!

142
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:24,331
(Bill grunts)

143
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:28,293
- [Jean] Tommy!

144
00:10:28,293 --> 00:10:30,378
- [Worker] Tommy!

145
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:31,630
- [Jean] Tommy!

146
00:10:34,842 --> 00:10:36,176
- Tommy!
- Tommy!

147
00:10:38,595 --> 00:10:41,264
(ominous music)

148
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:47,350
- [Jean] Tommy!

149
00:11:08,792 --> 00:11:12,879
(chatter drowned out by engines)

150
00:11:15,215 --> 00:11:18,009
(Bill speaks foreign language)

151
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:20,429
(worker speaks foreign language)

152
00:11:20,429 --> 00:11:22,389
(Bill speaks foreign language)

153
00:11:22,389 --> 00:11:25,517
(helicopter roars)

154
00:11:25,517 --> 00:11:29,479
(Bill speaks foreign language)

155
00:11:29,479 --> 00:11:32,899
(helicopter blades whir)

156
00:11:40,991 --> 00:11:43,868
(pilot speaks foreign language)

157
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:46,746
(Bill speaks foreign language)

158
00:11:46,747 --> 00:11:50,751
(pilot speaks foreign language)

159
00:12:04,306 --> 00:12:07,892
(distant children chatter)

160
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:14,900
- It's a big problem here,
yes? These abandoned children.

161
00:12:21,865 --> 00:12:23,992
More than two million,
roaming the streets.

162
00:12:23,992 --> 00:12:25,076
Et cetera, et cetera.

163
00:12:26,828 --> 00:12:29,872
I will cover it, but it's
been done so many times.

164
00:12:29,873 --> 00:12:32,125
- Jean's searched all
these places for Tommy.

165
00:12:33,043 --> 00:12:36,379
When she saw what was going
on, she kinda got involved.

166
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:39,299
- Oh. I see.

167
00:12:39,299 --> 00:12:43,428
She looks after lost children,
and maybe someone, somewhere,

168
00:12:43,428 --> 00:12:44,804
looks after her lost boy.

169
00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:49,726
(distant chatter)

170
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:55,606
- So, we gradually built up
this map of Amazonian tribes

171
00:12:55,607 --> 00:12:59,861
and their hunting grounds,
their numbers, cosmologies,

172
00:12:59,861 --> 00:13:00,695
and so on.

173
00:13:02,364 --> 00:13:04,616
Your editor was so helpful early on,

174
00:13:04,616 --> 00:13:06,117
by publishing our problem.

175
00:13:06,994 --> 00:13:09,955
A lot of people came
forward with information.

176
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:12,832
- Yeah. He is very sentimental.

177
00:13:13,875 --> 00:13:16,711
He likes, uh, human stories.

178
00:13:17,921 --> 00:13:19,130
It makes him feel noble.

179
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:21,382
- This area that, um,

180
00:13:22,926 --> 00:13:24,844
you and Bill are going to be going to.

181
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:30,475
We know for a fact there are at least

182
00:13:31,727 --> 00:13:32,769
two tribes

183
00:13:33,729 --> 00:13:36,148
that have had no contact
with the outside world.

184
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:39,275
- Are you taking fireworks this time, Dad?

185
00:13:39,276 --> 00:13:40,235
- Sure.

186
00:13:40,235 --> 00:13:42,779
- [Jean] Somewhere in this region here.

187
00:13:44,406 --> 00:13:45,365
- And, uh...

188
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:47,325
You think

189
00:13:48,243 --> 00:13:49,744
the poor little boy...

190
00:13:51,455 --> 00:13:54,166
- No. It's not knowing
that's so hard, you know?

191
00:13:55,208 --> 00:13:56,459
There are times when I...

192
00:13:57,461 --> 00:14:00,255
- You almost wish he were dead?

193
00:14:00,255 --> 00:14:02,590
Oh, so you can stop all the searching and

194
00:14:02,591 --> 00:14:05,343
at least you would have
some peace of mind.

195
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:06,470
I can understand that!

196
00:14:07,971 --> 00:14:09,597
- You don't understand at all.

197
00:14:12,142 --> 00:14:15,145
(boat engine chugs)

198
00:14:17,147 --> 00:14:19,065
- Can you smell it?

199
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:20,025
The oxygen?

200
00:14:21,109 --> 00:14:25,609
40% of the world's oxygen is
produced here, in the Amazon.

201
00:14:25,947 --> 00:14:26,781
- Come on, Uwe.

202
00:14:27,657 --> 00:14:30,951
You know oxygen doesn't
smell. It's the rot.

203
00:14:32,245 --> 00:14:33,079
The decay.

204
00:14:34,706 --> 00:14:36,374
- Also the blossoms.

205
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:58,434
(chatter in foreign language)
(camera shutter clicks)

206
00:15:03,777 --> 00:15:04,611
(camera shutter clicks)

207
00:15:04,611 --> 00:15:07,113
(birds chirp)

208
00:15:10,951 --> 00:15:12,869
(chatter in foreign language)

209
00:15:12,869 --> 00:15:13,703
- Look!

210
00:15:20,752 --> 00:15:24,589
(chatter in foreign language)

211
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:28,593
- You would miss these trips
if you found your boy, huh?

212
00:15:33,348 --> 00:15:35,600
- Listen, Uwe, I'm letting you tag along

213
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,602
because I owe your magazine a favor.

214
00:15:42,899 --> 00:15:45,985
But I am running out of
gratitude, real fast!

215
00:15:45,986 --> 00:15:47,988
- No,. Please.

216
00:15:47,988 --> 00:15:49,072
Just making fun!

217
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:55,954
(chatter in foreign language)

218
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:01,293
(boat engine chugs)

219
00:16:03,628 --> 00:16:06,088
(Leduc speaks foreign language)

220
00:16:06,089 --> 00:16:08,508
(bell rings)

221
00:16:10,218 --> 00:16:11,052
Ah!

222
00:16:13,555 --> 00:16:18,055
(children chatter in foreign language)

223
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:20,395
- Padre Leduc.

224
00:16:20,395 --> 00:16:22,563
- Hello.
- Good to see you.

225
00:16:22,564 --> 00:16:25,525
This is Uwe Werner.

226
00:16:25,525 --> 00:16:27,485
- Confirmed atheist, I'm afraid.

227
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:30,071
- Oh. They confirm atheists now.

228
00:16:30,071 --> 00:16:32,907
It's hard to keep up
with new ideas out here.

229
00:16:34,409 --> 00:16:35,243
- There you go.

230
00:16:38,705 --> 00:16:41,332
You got my message?
- I did, indeed.

231
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:43,418
Would this craft be suitable?

232
00:16:45,086 --> 00:16:46,045
- Just the ticket.

233
00:16:49,674 --> 00:16:52,385
- [Leduc] You talk with
the Indians before you go?

234
00:17:10,111 --> 00:17:12,947
(Bill speaks foreign language)

235
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:24,083
- He's saying something
about being not seen.

236
00:17:24,084 --> 00:17:27,670
- Yes. They say it's
an arrow of the, um...

237
00:17:28,838 --> 00:17:30,339
The Invisible People.

238
00:17:32,801 --> 00:17:36,679
(Bill speaks foreign language)

239
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:47,440
- Did he say, "They hunt
on this side of the river"?

240
00:17:48,316 --> 00:17:51,235
- Yes.
(camera shutter clicks)

241
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:54,030
- You ever had contact with this tribe?

242
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:56,032
- Nobody has.

243
00:17:56,032 --> 00:17:58,784
Even these people here
have only heard about them,

244
00:17:58,785 --> 00:17:59,827
from others.

245
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:07,544
(chatter in foreign language)

246
00:18:07,544 --> 00:18:10,630
(gentle synth music)

247
00:18:15,635 --> 00:18:18,137
(birds chirp)

248
00:18:28,231 --> 00:18:31,067
(animals chatter)

249
00:19:18,948 --> 00:19:21,867
(dart whooshes)

250
00:19:40,387 --> 00:19:42,639
I killed him!
One dart!

251
00:19:51,147 --> 00:19:55,647
- Tomme.

252
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:09,207
No.

253
00:20:09,249 --> 00:20:11,668
He's old and slow, like me.

254
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:14,546
(Wanadi chuckles)

255
00:20:18,883 --> 00:20:21,677
(birds chirp)

256
00:20:21,678 --> 00:20:24,430
(water splashes)

257
00:20:27,475 --> 00:20:31,975
Beware, it's a very hungry jaguar
that hunts fish.

258
00:20:32,522 --> 00:20:35,274
(water splashes)

259
00:20:49,497 --> 00:20:52,249
(water splashes)

260
00:21:00,008 --> 00:21:04,220
Allow for the water
bending the arrow.

261
00:21:05,555 --> 00:21:08,057
(birds chirp)

262
00:21:15,106 --> 00:21:17,608
(birds chirp)

263
00:21:26,951 --> 00:21:29,453
(birds chirp)

264
00:21:35,835 --> 00:21:38,629
One more day and we are home.

265
00:21:39,088 --> 00:21:41,673
(bird squawks)

266
00:21:46,012 --> 00:21:50,057
When you hear the toucan,
danger is near.

267
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:56,064
(distant tribe chants)

268
00:22:00,568 --> 00:22:03,153
The Fierce People.

269
00:22:03,905 --> 00:22:08,405
(tribe chants)
(percussive music)

270
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:19,166
(tribe chants)
(percussive music)

271
00:22:23,007 --> 00:22:26,593
(distant boat engine hums)

272
00:22:33,226 --> 00:22:36,145
(boat engine revs)

273
00:22:47,657 --> 00:22:50,409
(birds chirp)

274

(tribe members howl)

276
00:23:05,633 --> 00:23:07,051
- Tomme!
- Wanadi!

277
00:23:08,386 --> 00:23:10,471
Wanadi.

278
00:23:10,471 --> 00:23:12,347
(tribe members howl)

279
00:23:12,432 --> 00:23:14,058
I killed a monkey.

280
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:16,060
By yourself?

281
00:23:16,102 --> 00:23:19,063
My father let me.

282
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:23,151
We saw the Fierce People.

283
00:23:27,447 --> 00:23:31,947
A war party of the Fierce People
is very close.

284
00:23:34,996 --> 00:23:39,250
We must be prepared.

285
00:23:44,631 --> 00:23:46,466
I will watch.

286
00:23:50,803 --> 00:23:53,680
Mother, it's for you.

287
00:23:55,141 --> 00:23:57,017
Honey.

288
00:24:08,279 --> 00:24:11,782
My new son!

289
00:24:18,081 --> 00:24:19,332
- Mapi!
- Tomme!

290
00:24:21,125 --> 00:24:25,625
(children chatter in foreign language)

291
00:24:30,927 --> 00:24:35,427
(waterfall roars)
(both grunt)

292
00:24:37,475 --> 00:24:38,601
- Woo!
- Woo!

293
00:24:38,601 --> 00:24:42,187
(water splashes)

294
00:24:42,188 --> 00:24:45,774
(distant percussive music)

295
00:24:57,829 --> 00:24:59,372
Girls from Paranita.

296
00:25:03,584 --> 00:25:05,836
(bow string thuds)

297
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,546
Who's she?

298
00:25:07,588 --> 00:25:09,548
That's Kachiri.

299
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:12,092
Little Kachiri?

300
00:25:12,135 --> 00:25:14,178
You like her?

301
00:25:20,601 --> 00:25:22,853
(Mapi pants)

302
00:25:22,854 --> 00:25:24,063
(Mapi chuckles)

303
00:25:24,063 --> 00:25:28,317
(tribe members chatter and giggle)

304
00:25:33,948 --> 00:25:36,575
(Mapi laughs)

305
00:25:38,286 --> 00:25:41,205
You will scare the fish.

306
00:25:41,247 --> 00:25:43,582
You won't spear a fish.

307
00:25:43,624 --> 00:25:46,251
But a fish is going to spear you.

308
00:25:46,961 --> 00:25:49,964
(suspenseful music)

309
00:25:51,883 --> 00:25:53,259
(Kachiri yelps)

310
00:25:53,259 --> 00:25:56,178
(percussive music)

311
00:26:00,683 --> 00:26:02,434
Tomme, you think you are a man...

312
00:26:03,269 --> 00:26:07,106
but I only see a stupid boy.

313
00:26:10,109 --> 00:26:13,028
Your time has come to die.

314
00:26:16,407 --> 00:26:18,242
Must he die?

315
00:26:18,284 --> 00:26:20,577
Yes.

316
00:26:20,703 --> 00:26:24,707
I will never see my boy again.

317
00:26:28,419 --> 00:26:32,339
(ritualistic percussive music)

318
00:26:34,175 --> 00:26:38,675
(tribe members chant in foreign language)

(water swashes)

331
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:10,270
The boy is dead...

332
00:28:13,733 --> 00:28:16,610
and the man is born.

333
00:28:18,446 --> 00:28:20,865
(wind music)

334
00:28:24,410 --> 00:28:27,246
(waterfall roars)

335
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:42,428
- [Bill] Hold it!

336
00:28:59,487 --> 00:29:01,780
- I was beginning to lose faith in you.

337
00:29:03,199 --> 00:29:04,074
- We'll camp here.

338
00:29:33,729 --> 00:29:36,148
(Uwe grunts)

339
00:29:43,614 --> 00:29:46,241

(pots clang)

341
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:57,335
(insects buzz)

342
00:29:58,796 --> 00:30:01,131
- How do they get under the net?

343
00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:02,007
How do they do it?

344
00:30:02,925 --> 00:30:05,177
- You're not losing your
sense of humor, are you, Uwe?

345
00:30:10,474 --> 00:30:13,602
- [Uwe] All this waiting. Is
that what you do for 10 years?

346
00:30:13,602 --> 00:30:14,894
Wait?

347
00:30:14,895 --> 00:30:16,396
- [Bill] Mostly.

348
00:30:16,397 --> 00:30:20,317
(ritualistic percussive music)

349
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:46,635
(Tomme grunts)

350
00:30:52,683 --> 00:30:55,268
(Tomme grunts)

351
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:02,984
(Tomme grunts)

352
00:31:10,493 --> 00:31:14,246
(percussive music continues)

353
00:31:36,811 --> 00:31:39,563
(suspenseful music)

354
00:31:39,563 --> 00:31:42,232
(eagle screams)

355
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:53,577
(suspenseful music continues)

356
00:31:58,082 --> 00:32:00,751

(eagle screams)

360
00:33:04,148 --> 00:33:07,568
(Tomme breathes heavily)

361
00:33:08,777 --> 00:33:11,237
I saw green stones in a waterfall.

362
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:13,573
You have seen the Sacred Stones.

363
00:33:13,616 --> 00:33:18,116
It was the place we lived in
before the Fierce People came.

364
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:25,790
From these stones comes the paint
that makes us the Invisible People.

365
00:33:28,797 --> 00:33:31,591
Just these are left.

366
00:33:31,634 --> 00:33:35,137
I will go to that place
and find more stones.

367
00:33:43,145 --> 00:33:46,648
(lively percussive music)

368
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:53,864
(birds chirp)

369
00:33:56,408 --> 00:33:58,993
(gentle music)

00:51:25,456 --> 00:51:28,500
trouble is not far behind.

558
00:51:31,796 --> 00:51:34,924
(Bill groans lightly)

559
00:51:39,971 --> 00:51:43,975
He has a fever.

560
00:51:48,479 --> 00:51:50,606
He is near death.

561
00:51:50,648 --> 00:51:55,148
Father, surely you can cure him.

562
00:51:55,820 --> 00:51:58,906
Even a great storm...

563
00:51:58,948 --> 00:52:02,701
can not always quench
a forest fire.

564
00:52:03,202 --> 00:52:06,788
- Wanad..
Wanadi, do it.

565
00:52:06,831 --> 00:52:10,000
If it can be done...

566
00:52:10,043 --> 00:52:11,878
I will do it.

567
00:52:12,420 --> 00:52:15,589
(Bill grunts lightly)

568
00:52:16,507 --> 00:52:19,635
Daddee. Can you hear me?

569
00:52:20,928 --> 00:52:24,306
- Tommy! (grunts)

570
00:52:25,141 --> 00:52:27,268
He will hear you.

571
00:52:30,605 --> 00:52:35,105
I will suck out the evil fire.

572
00:52:40,615 --> 00:52:44,869
(Wanadi yells in foreign language)

573
00:52:45,953 --> 00:52:50,207
(Wanadi yells in foreign language)

574
00:53:06,140 --> 00:53:09,852
(Wanadi blows sharply)

575
00:53:09,852 --> 00:53:14,352
The evil fire is gone.

576
00:53:17,777 --> 00:53:20,112
You see...

577
00:53:20,154 --> 00:53:22,156
he is a great healer.

578
00:53:26,411 --> 00:53:29,163
Now, he must sleep.

579
00:53:30,206 --> 00:53:32,166
(birds chirp)

580
00:53:32,166 --> 00:53:36,666
(tribe members chatter
in foreign language)

581
00:53:41,801 --> 00:53:44,261
I will show you a great secret.

582
00:53:44,303 --> 00:53:47,222
(gentle wind music)

583
00:53:47,223 --> 00:53:49,016
(Wanadi sucks sharply)

584
00:53:49,142 --> 00:53:50,852
Watch the fire.

585
00:53:51,018 --> 00:53:54,271
(Wanadi sucks sharply)

586
00:53:55,356 --> 00:53:58,567
(Wanadi coughs)

587
00:53:58,568 --> 00:54:00,611
(Tomme winces)

588
00:54:00,611 --> 00:54:02,821
(Wanadi chuckles)

589
00:54:02,822 --> 00:54:05,199
(both laugh)

590
00:54:08,870 --> 00:54:11,956
(distant baby cries)

591
00:54:15,626 --> 00:54:19,504
(Bill breathes heavily)

592
00:54:19,547 --> 00:54:22,800
(distant baby cries)

593
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:24,968
Why did you take my son?

594
00:54:25,011 --> 00:54:29,511
One day, I was hunting
at the edge of the world...

595
00:54:30,099 --> 00:54:34,019
when Tomme appeared...

596
00:54:34,061 --> 00:54:37,481
and he smiled...

597
00:54:37,523 --> 00:54:42,023
and even though you were
a Termite Child...

598
00:54:42,987 --> 00:54:47,487
I had not the heart...

599
00:54:47,533 --> 00:54:52,033
to send you back
to The Dead World.

600
00:54:54,874 --> 00:54:58,544
Why are they called
The Termite People?

601
00:54:58,586 --> 00:55:00,671
They come into the world...

602
00:55:00,713 --> 00:55:03,966
and chew down all
the grandfather trees.

603
00:55:04,008 --> 00:55:08,220
Just like termites.

604
00:55:13,518 --> 00:55:18,018
(distant chatter in foreign language)

605
00:55:33,412 --> 00:55:37,165
(Wanadi grunts aggressively)

606
00:55:53,683 --> 00:55:57,144
(gentle percussive music)

607
00:55:59,605 --> 00:56:02,024
(tribe member yells in foreign language)

608
00:56:02,066 --> 00:56:05,861
(tribe members hoot and howl)

609
00:56:09,115 --> 00:56:13,035
(suspenseful percussive music)

610
00:56:18,666 --> 00:56:20,042
(tribe members squeal)

611
00:56:22,253 --> 00:56:25,881
I want your daughter...

612
00:56:25,923 --> 00:56:28,467
but I give you the Sacred Stones.

613
00:56:28,843 --> 00:56:29,677
- Ah,

614
00:56:31,095 --> 00:56:31,929
Oh.

615
00:56:34,348 --> 00:56:37,851
(tribe members squeal)

616
00:56:37,852 --> 00:56:41,814
(tribe members grunt)

617
00:56:41,856 --> 00:56:45,776
- Kachari, you will tend the fire.
- No! I tend to my father's fire.

618
00:56:48,487 --> 00:56:50,489
Do it right.

619
00:56:50,907 --> 00:56:55,407
(tribe members grunt
with percussive music)

620
00:56:57,705 --> 00:57:01,959
(stick thuds)
(tribe members squeal)

621
00:57:01,959 --> 00:57:06,171
(tribe members grunt rhythmically)

622
00:57:07,089 --> 00:57:09,841
(friends giggle)

623
00:57:11,177 --> 00:57:13,679
(birds chirp)

624
00:57:13,679 --> 00:57:16,014
(gun cocks)

625
00:57:21,604 --> 00:57:24,607
(gun fires rapidly)

626
00:57:28,903 --> 00:57:29,987
- No, no, no.

627
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:44,835
This.

628
00:57:44,835 --> 00:57:45,669
No.

629
00:57:45,670 --> 00:57:47,254
This. Huh?

630
00:57:47,254 --> 00:57:51,341
(trader speaks foreign language)

631
00:57:52,468 --> 00:57:56,346
(Jacareh speaks foreign language)

632
00:57:56,347 --> 00:58:00,847
(trader speaks foreign language)

633
00:58:01,185 --> 00:58:05,685
(chatter in foreign language)

634
00:58:05,773 --> 00:58:08,358
(gentle music)

635
00:58:56,532 --> 00:58:59,952
(gentle music continues)

636
00:59:04,373 --> 00:59:06,875
(birds chirp)

637
00:59:22,433 --> 00:59:26,933
(distant chatter in foreign language)

638
00:59:28,064 --> 00:59:30,524
(Bill grunts)

639
00:59:39,658 --> 00:59:42,160
You like it?

640
00:59:42,203 --> 00:59:44,163
I made it for you.

641
00:59:44,246 --> 00:59:45,080
- Tommy.

642
00:59:46,665 --> 00:59:47,499
- Tomme?

643
00:59:58,135 --> 01:00:01,346
Tomme Kachiri.
Tomme needs Kachari...

644
01:00:01,347 --> 01:00:05,184
Kachiri Tomme.
and Kachari needs Tomme.

645
01:00:05,267 --> 01:00:07,644
You need me?

646
01:00:16,821 --> 01:00:19,114
You are well?

647
01:00:19,156 --> 01:00:23,034
She is yours if you have need.

648
01:00:23,285 --> 01:00:24,369
Need?

649
01:00:24,370 --> 01:00:25,662
Yes.

650
01:00:34,463 --> 01:00:36,506
Eat and be strong...

651
01:00:36,549 --> 01:00:40,302
then you will have need.

652
01:00:40,344 --> 01:00:43,430
Shall we go to the river and bathe?

653
01:00:53,232 --> 01:00:56,068
(waterfall roars)

654
01:00:57,444 --> 01:00:59,112
(tribe member yells)

655
01:00:59,113 --> 01:01:00,280
(water splashes)

656
01:01:00,281 --> 01:01:01,115
- Woo!

657
01:01:15,462 --> 01:01:19,174
We have crushed
the sacred stones.

658
01:01:19,216 --> 01:01:22,427
And once again they...

659
01:01:22,469 --> 01:01:25,054
shine in our war paint.

660
01:01:25,097 --> 01:01:26,890
You are well.

661
01:01:26,932 --> 01:01:27,766
- Tommy.

662
01:01:29,351 --> 01:01:30,935
Tomme.

663
01:01:30,936 --> 01:01:34,814
I want you to come with me.

664
01:01:34,815 --> 01:01:36,441
Momme wants you to come home.

665
01:01:36,483 --> 01:01:40,983
He is finished with mothers.
I am his woman now.

666
01:01:44,116 --> 01:01:46,701
You stole my son.

667
01:01:48,204 --> 01:01:52,124
He took you from me, from Momme.

668
01:01:56,086 --> 01:01:58,463
That was long ago.

669
01:02:01,926 --> 01:02:05,679
I just want you to see the home
that you came from.

670
01:02:05,763 --> 01:02:08,015
This is my home.

671
01:02:10,226 --> 01:02:12,686
It will be the home of my
children.

672
01:02:19,443 --> 01:02:21,611
Daddee, you must rest here...

673
01:02:21,654 --> 01:02:24,323
and we must hunt.

674
01:02:25,449 --> 01:02:28,326
For tonight is the feast
of Tomme and Kachari.

675
01:02:31,288 --> 01:02:33,623
Stop.

676
01:02:33,666 --> 01:02:34,833
You are the chief.

677
01:02:34,917 --> 01:02:36,877
Tell him to come and visit.

678
01:02:37,670 --> 01:02:39,463
He can choose.

679
01:02:39,505 --> 01:02:41,298
If I tell a man...

680
01:02:41,340 --> 01:02:43,592
to do what he does not
want to do...

681
01:02:43,634 --> 01:02:46,261
I am no longer chief.

682
01:02:47,096 --> 01:02:50,265
(tribe members cheer)

683
01:02:54,103 --> 01:02:57,272
(tribe members cheer)

684
01:03:01,402 --> 01:03:04,071
(Bill whimpers)

685
01:03:06,407 --> 01:03:10,907
(distant chatter in foreign language)

686
01:03:30,014 --> 01:03:33,517
Why are you so sad?

687
01:03:36,312 --> 01:03:37,146
- Oh.

688
01:03:42,901 --> 01:03:47,401
Ten years, Tomme...

689
01:03:47,489 --> 01:03:51,075
looking for you...

690
01:03:51,076 --> 01:03:55,288
all over.

691
01:03:55,372 --> 01:03:59,501
Yes. It is good to hunt...

692
01:03:59,543 --> 01:04:03,338
to track an animal.

693
01:04:03,380 --> 01:04:07,842
You should be happy.

694
01:04:07,885 --> 01:04:10,971
But no, you feel sad.

695
01:04:16,560 --> 01:04:19,271
It will be a good feast tonight.

696
01:04:22,649 --> 01:04:26,152
(lively percussive music)

697
01:04:44,588 --> 01:04:48,925
(lively percussive music continues)

698
01:05:07,361 --> 01:05:11,861
(lively percussive music)
(tribe members chant)

699
01:05:18,580 --> 01:05:22,417
(tribe members scream wildly)

700
01:05:29,508 --> 01:05:33,345
(tribe members scream wildly)

701
01:05:36,598 --> 01:05:40,435
(tribe members scream wildly)

702
01:05:43,647 --> 01:05:47,776
(percussive music continues)

703
01:05:47,776 --> 01:05:51,780
(tribe members grunt and snarl)

704
01:06:03,125 --> 01:06:06,878
(percussive music continues)

705
01:06:15,471 --> 01:06:19,224
(percussive music continues)

706
01:06:28,275 --> 01:06:32,112
(tribe members hoot and howl)

707
01:06:42,247 --> 01:06:43,081
- Tomme.

708
01:06:45,959 --> 01:06:49,212
I must return.

709
01:06:50,881 --> 01:06:54,843
Why go back
to that terrible place?

710
01:06:54,885 --> 01:06:56,595
You can stay...

711
01:06:56,637 --> 01:06:59,806
and become a great warrior
and hunter.

712
01:07:02,518 --> 01:07:06,271
My family is there.

713
01:07:06,396 --> 01:07:08,439
It is where I belong.

714
01:07:13,946 --> 01:07:14,905
- Tomme.

715
01:07:14,988 --> 01:07:16,364
Bring the pipe.

716
01:07:22,371 --> 01:07:25,624
I swore to Tommy's mother...

717
01:07:25,749 --> 01:07:28,418
I would bring him back.

718
01:07:31,380 --> 01:07:35,050
your heart is torn.

719
01:07:35,092 --> 01:07:38,470
If you take him,
you'll wish you had not.

720
01:07:40,931 --> 01:07:45,018
If you don't take him
you will wish you had.

721
01:08:07,541 --> 01:08:12,041
You are a man of courage.

722
01:08:12,254 --> 01:08:14,839
You have traveled far...

723
01:08:14,881 --> 01:08:18,718
and you have come
to the center of the world.

724
01:08:20,095 --> 01:08:23,807
Now you can go farther
and see more.

725
01:08:23,849 --> 01:08:28,061
But you can not enter
that place naked.

726
01:08:31,315 --> 01:08:34,609
It is our way.

727
01:09:01,053 --> 01:09:04,473
Accept our gift, Daddee...

728
01:09:07,267 --> 01:09:11,145
You will meet your spirit animal
and he will show you.

729
01:09:14,858 --> 01:09:17,652
(tribe member blows sharply)
(Bill groans)

730
01:09:17,653 --> 01:09:20,155
(Bill groans)

731
01:09:21,865 --> 01:09:24,576
(tribe member blows sharply)
(Bill groans)

732
01:09:24,576 --> 01:09:27,370
(Bill groans)

733
01:09:27,371 --> 01:09:29,956
(Bill screams)

734
01:09:32,084 --> 01:09:34,586
(dark percussive music)

735
01:09:34,586 --> 01:09:37,255
(leopard roars)

736
01:09:47,891 --> 01:09:51,102
(dark music continues)

737
01:10:10,706 --> 01:10:13,959
(dark music continues)

738
01:10:21,550 --> 01:10:25,303
(leopard roars)
(glass shatters)

739
01:10:25,303 --> 01:10:28,514
(Bill gasps)

740
01:10:28,515 --> 01:10:31,684
(distant engines rev)

741
01:10:39,651 --> 01:10:42,487
(distant chatter)

742
01:10:45,991 --> 01:10:49,703
- Hey.

743

(chatter in foreign language)

745
01:11:05,802 --> 01:11:07,678
When I was a boy...

746
01:11:07,721 --> 01:11:11,099
the Edge of the World
was very far...

747
01:11:11,141 --> 01:11:14,978
but every year it comes closer.

748
01:11:22,611 --> 01:11:24,237
- Oh.

749
01:11:24,237 --> 01:11:25,071
You're home.

750
01:11:33,663 --> 01:11:35,331
Oh, my God. What's happened you?

751
01:11:36,958 --> 01:11:38,209
Something's happened.

752
01:11:41,922 --> 01:11:43,423
You know something, don't you?

753
01:11:47,385 --> 01:11:48,219
- Yeah.

754
01:11:49,346 --> 01:11:51,848
(birds chirp)

755
01:11:57,437 --> 01:12:00,106
(ominous music)
(tribe members murmur)

756
01:12:00,106 --> 01:12:04,360
(Wanadi yells in foreign language)

757
01:12:07,781 --> 01:12:12,202
(ominous percussive music continues)

758
01:12:33,640 --> 01:12:36,267
The Fierce Ones came before dawn.

759
01:12:36,643 --> 01:12:41,143
Tomme, Tomme!

760
01:12:43,024 --> 01:12:44,525
- [Tomme] Kachiri!

761
01:12:47,070 --> 01:12:47,904
Kachiri!

762
01:12:49,322 --> 01:12:51,324
Mother!

763
01:13:01,418 --> 01:13:04,754
There was a terrible noise.

764
01:13:06,464 --> 01:13:09,467
They had spears
that make lightning.

765
01:13:13,972 --> 01:13:15,807
Kachiri.
Did you see Kachari?

766
01:13:15,891 --> 01:13:18,018
I ran away.

767
01:13:20,770 --> 01:13:25,065
Uluru. Father, they have killed Uiuru.

768
01:13:25,066 --> 01:13:27,693
Kachiri.
I can not find Kachari.

769
01:13:36,453 --> 01:13:38,955
(Tomme pants)

770
01:13:40,540 --> 01:13:44,460
(suspenseful percussive music)

771
01:13:46,630 --> 01:13:47,464
- Tomme!

772
01:13:50,884 --> 01:13:53,761
- Tomme!

773
01:13:58,058 --> 01:14:02,558
(fire crackles)
(somber wind music)

774
01:14:14,950 --> 01:14:19,450
(fire crackles)
(somber wind music continues)

775
01:14:32,300 --> 01:14:36,800
The fire will set free
their souls to the stars.

776
01:14:46,898 --> 01:14:50,735
(somber wind music continues)

777
01:14:52,821 --> 01:14:56,407
(tools clack rhythmically)

778
01:14:59,577 --> 01:15:03,497
And what is left of the dead
must be crushed.

779
01:15:05,208 --> 01:15:08,085
Crushed into dust.

780
01:15:10,130 --> 01:15:14,630
In here is the dust of those
who went before us...

781
01:15:14,884 --> 01:15:18,929
even the First Man
and First Woman.

782
01:15:27,647 --> 01:15:30,149
(ashes crash)

783
01:15:45,832 --> 01:15:49,252
(somber music continues)

784
01:16:03,767 --> 01:16:07,771
Now drink in memory
of what we have been...

785
01:16:07,812 --> 01:16:12,312
and the lives of those
who went before us...

786
01:16:12,484 --> 01:16:15,403
will live inside us.

787
01:16:28,792 --> 01:16:31,961
Drink, boy. You come too.

788
01:16:43,181 --> 01:16:47,681
(tribe members chatter
in foreign language)

789
01:16:55,068 --> 01:16:59,568

(distant engines hum)

799
01:17:44,617 --> 01:17:47,953
They are taking
the Skin off The World.

800
01:17:47,996 --> 01:17:49,747
How will she breathe?

801
01:17:49,789 --> 01:17:53,459
There was a great river there once.

802
01:17:53,501 --> 01:17:55,127
What is that?

803
01:17:58,047 --> 01:18:01,300
It's like...a log jam.

804
01:18:01,342 --> 01:18:04,345
This was the home
of the Fierce People.

805
01:18:04,387 --> 01:18:08,265
Now we know why they came
to our part of The World.

806
01:18:11,769 --> 01:18:12,811
Father, there!

807
01:18:19,110 --> 01:18:20,152
Come back.

808
01:18:20,361 --> 01:18:23,906
We are not invisible
in The Dead World.

809
01:18:23,948 --> 01:18:24,907
But Father!

810
01:18:24,949 --> 01:18:28,160
No. We go along
The Edge of The World.

811
01:18:28,161 --> 01:18:30,204
(vehicle approaches)

812
01:18:30,205 --> 01:18:31,122

(tribe member groans)

833
01:20:12,932 --> 01:20:16,727
Look. Strange trees and vines.

834
01:20:18,313 --> 01:20:20,023
We can climb up.

835
01:20:20,064 --> 01:20:22,608
Go across the vine and down.

836
01:20:46,299 --> 01:20:48,884

Oh! Hah-hah!

855
01:22:32,989 --> 01:22:36,075
If we attack now we will all die.

856
01:22:36,117 --> 01:22:39,829
But without our women
we will be a people no more.

Put me down. I must die.

Brother, set my soul free with fire.

886
01:24:20,096 --> 01:24:23,182
Add a few grains of my bones...

887
01:24:23,224 --> 01:24:27,724
to the dust of those
that went before us.

888
01:24:28,854 --> 01:24:33,275
Tomme,.
Son...

889
01:24:33,317 --> 01:24:35,694
do what I could not do.

890
01:24:35,736 --> 01:24:38,613
I will, Father.

891
01:24:51,794 --> 01:24:54,129
Do as my father says.

892
01:24:54,171 --> 01:24:56,715
Take his body back...

893
01:24:56,757 --> 01:24:59,176
and wait for me there.

894
01:25:01,095 --> 01:25:03,931
What? Where will you go?

895
01:25:06,100 --> 01:25:08,685
I will go beyond
The Edge of The World.

896
01:25:08,728 --> 01:25:11,272
To find my other father.

897
01:25:11,314 --> 01:25:14,358
He knows about the Lightning Spears.

898
01:25:14,400 --> 01:25:16,777
I will ask him to help us.

899
01:25:24,076 --> 01:25:28,576
(Tomme and Mapi pant)
(lively percussive music)

900
01:25:31,167 --> 01:25:33,294
How do you know this is the way?

901
01:25:33,336 --> 01:25:37,836
He told me he lives at the end
of The-River-Without-Water.

He said his village...

910
01:26:29,183 --> 01:26:31,643
has more people than ants
in an ant hill.

911
01:26:32,436 --> 01:26:34,354

I know you.

933
01:28:36,268 --> 01:28:40,563
You are The Invisible People.

934
01:28:41,524 --> 01:28:45,778
Come. Hurry.

935
01:28:50,115 --> 01:28:51,157
(door closes)

936
01:28:51,158 --> 01:28:54,536
So there are still people like you.

937

(Paulo laughs)

942
01:29:16,767 --> 01:29:21,229
We once lived out there,
not far from them.

943
01:29:21,230 --> 01:29:23,565
You called us The Bat People.

944
01:29:23,566 --> 01:29:25,025
Because you hunted at night.

945
01:29:25,067 --> 01:29:27,444
My father told me many stories
about your tribe.

946
01:29:29,196 --> 01:29:30,947
Why do you come here?

947
01:29:30,948 --> 01:29:34,284
We seek what you call
A White Man.

948
01:29:34,326 --> 01:29:36,244
Can you help us?

949
01:29:36,579 --> 01:29:37,997
What's he called?

950
01:29:37,997 --> 01:29:41,166
- Bill. Bill.
Bill. He said he was called Bill.

951
01:29:41,166 --> 01:29:42,458
- Mm. (chuckles)

952
01:29:42,459 --> 01:29:44,669
Bill. Senor Bill.
Senor Bill?

953
01:29:44,670 --> 01:29:45,837
It's not enough.

954
01:29:46,255 --> 01:29:50,342
The people here have many names.
You must know them all...

955
01:29:50,426 --> 01:29:53,429
and each living place
has a number.

956
01:29:53,429 --> 01:29:56,348
Did he tell you any numbers?

957
01:29:56,432 --> 01:29:57,433
No.

958
01:30:00,603 --> 01:30:02,396
We can not wait.

959
01:30:02,438 --> 01:30:04,690
I must find him.

960
01:30:04,732 --> 01:30:06,191
(suspenseful music)

961
01:30:06,358 --> 01:30:09,569

we will tell our children...

1064
01:39:45,270 --> 01:39:47,939
the story of what
you did for us.

1065
01:39:51,359 --> 01:39:53,319
You will always live
in our hearts...

1066
01:39:53,361 --> 01:39:55,112
and in our dreams.

1067
01:39:59,159 --> 01:40:02,162
Tommie, my son.

1068

1071
01:40:14,174 --> 01:40:18,094
Yes. Lots of logs and the river...
can not flow.

1072
01:40:20,972 --> 01:40:23,474
Because of that log jam...

1073
01:40:23,517 --> 01:40:27,229
more white people
will come here...

1074
01:40:27,229 --> 01:40:31,274
and enter The World
and cut down more trees...

1075
01:40:31,274 --> 01:40:35,194
and take what is yours.

1076
01:40:35,237 --> 01:40:37,572
They will not find us.

1077
01:40:37,614 --> 01:40:39,490
We are The Invisible People.

1078
01:40:39,616 --> 01:40:43,536
They will, Tommie.
They will see you.

1079
01:40:47,415 --> 01:40:49,125
Father...

1080
01:40:49,167 --> 01:40:51,377
if that is a log jam...

1081
01:40:51,419 --> 01:40:53,546
water can break it.

1082
01:40:53,672 --> 01:40:54,506
- No.
No.

1083
01:40:56,716 --> 01:40:58,759
A great flood of water
can break it.

1084
01:40:58,885 --> 01:41:00,177
No.

1085
01:41:00,637 --> 01:41:02,805
Not this kind of log jam

1086
01:41:05,600 --> 01:41:07,852
you remember.

1087
01:41:07,894 --> 01:41:10,938
The frogs sing and it rains.

1088
01:41:12,607 --> 01:41:15,192
We will ask the frogs
to sing very loud.

1089

You?

meet in the big river...

1164

01:48:08,773 --> 01:48:12,026
Because it is angry, very...

(tribe members laugh)

1194
01:50:06,516 --> 01:50:09,477
It is time to settle these matters.

And Jabuti?

1196
01:50:25,326 --> 01:50:27,786

You should marry
one or two of them.
