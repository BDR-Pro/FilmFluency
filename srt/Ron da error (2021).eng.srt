1
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:45,670

2
00:00:55,323 --> 00:00:57,390
Back in five,

3
00:00:57,424 --> 00:00:59,459
we are streaming live
from Bubble HQ.

4
00:00:59,492 --> 00:01:00,862
It's launch day
at Bubble.

5
00:01:00,895 --> 00:01:03,064
What incredible tech
are they about to unveil?

6
00:01:03,097 --> 00:01:04,731
We're going in.

7
00:01:12,539 --> 00:01:16,244
<i>Have you ever felt
completely alone?</i>

8
00:01:16,277 --> 00:01:19,512
Standing on the edge
of things, so awkward,

9
00:01:19,546 --> 00:01:22,515
not daring to approach anyone?

10
00:01:22,549 --> 00:01:25,853
What if you could have
one perfect friend

11
00:01:25,887 --> 00:01:29,489
who thinks you're awesome,
who can help you find friends

12
00:01:29,522 --> 00:01:32,293
and make it all easy?

13
00:01:32,326 --> 00:01:34,661
<i>All staff
to the launchitorium.</i>

14
00:01:34,694 --> 00:01:36,730
<i>Marc, they're ready.</i>

15
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:38,199
<i>Marc?</i>

16
00:01:38,232 --> 00:01:40,902
So, this is it.

17
00:01:41,568 --> 00:01:43,938
This is finally it!

18
00:01:43,971 --> 00:01:45,705
The day that we at Bubble

19
00:01:45,739 --> 00:01:49,277
give the whole world
a new best friend!

20
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:55,283
Marc! Marc! Marc!

21
00:01:55,316 --> 00:01:57,818
Aw!
We did this together, guys!

22
00:01:57,852 --> 00:01:59,820
This is what
it's all been for.

23
00:01:59,854 --> 00:02:01,255
Right back to the time
in the garage

24
00:02:01,289 --> 00:02:02,323
where Bubble started.

25
00:02:02,356 --> 00:02:04,658
My garage, folks. My garage.

26
00:02:04,691 --> 00:02:07,794
Of course, yes, Andrew.

27
00:02:07,828 --> 00:02:09,063
Thanks. Uh...

28
00:02:09,096 --> 00:02:10,097
But today,

29
00:02:10,131 --> 00:02:11,698
we take a huge leap

30
00:02:11,731 --> 00:02:14,402
from Bubble's phones
and tablets and watches

31
00:02:14,434 --> 00:02:17,972
to a whole new world
of connection.

32
00:02:18,005 --> 00:02:20,408
And at its heart, my code.

33
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,442
My algorithm for friendship.

34
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:25,679
The code that drives
your new best friend,

35
00:02:25,712 --> 00:02:27,048
the Bubble Bot.

36
00:02:27,081 --> 00:02:30,284
<i>Welcome
to the future of friendship.</i>

37
00:02:30,318 --> 00:02:32,686
You wanna meet it? Okay!

38
00:02:34,021 --> 00:02:35,089
Me! Me!
Me, me! Over here!

39
00:02:35,122 --> 00:02:36,723
Pick me! Please!

40
00:02:36,756 --> 00:02:39,193
Do we have an "EllieB9"?

41
00:02:39,226 --> 00:02:41,795
Oh, my gosh!
That's me, that's me!

42
00:02:42,163 --> 00:02:43,496
Hi.

43
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:46,400
Hi. So, that's your posts,
and friends,

44
00:02:46,434 --> 00:02:47,567
and photos, right?

45
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,469
- Yeah.
- Okay.

46
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:52,173
Ellie, this is for you.

47
00:02:52,206 --> 00:02:56,143
The world's
very first Bubble Bot.

48
00:03:06,988 --> 00:03:07,989
Wow.

49
00:03:08,022 --> 00:03:09,489
Go ahead.

50
00:03:22,236 --> 00:03:23,404
What's happening?

51
00:03:23,437 --> 00:03:24,771
It's getting to know you!

52
00:03:24,805 --> 00:03:26,907
Everything about you.

53
00:03:30,478 --> 00:03:32,046
Hi, Ellie.

54
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:34,315
<i>Danger-Bunny!</i>
That's my favorite show!

55
00:03:34,348 --> 00:03:35,582
Mine, too!

56
00:03:35,615 --> 00:03:37,684
Awesome!

57
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:39,652
Infinite
downloadable skins!

58
00:03:42,089 --> 00:03:43,790
I love monkeys!

59
00:03:43,824 --> 00:03:46,293
Apps, contacts, photos, chat.

60
00:03:46,327 --> 00:03:47,727
Ooh, look at this!

61
00:03:47,761 --> 00:03:48,728
Whoa.

62
00:03:48,762 --> 00:03:50,398
Music. Of course.

63
00:03:51,765 --> 00:03:53,100
Jump on!

64
00:03:54,534 --> 00:03:55,803
- Whoa!
- Incredible safety settings

65
00:03:55,836 --> 00:03:57,505
to keep your parents happy.

66
00:03:57,537 --> 00:03:59,572
You can be anything
in the world?

67
00:03:59,606 --> 00:04:02,343
In the universe! Hold on.

68
00:04:04,278 --> 00:04:06,679
- Oh, I love space.
- Me too!

69
00:04:06,713 --> 00:04:09,350
Three-sixty degree
immersive projection.

70
00:04:09,383 --> 00:04:11,152
First selfie
from the red planet?

71
00:04:11,185 --> 00:04:12,319
Okay.

72
00:04:12,353 --> 00:04:13,653
Sharing.

73
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:16,790
Constant connection
to the Bubble network.

74
00:04:16,824 --> 00:04:18,292
Oh, my gosh! Like it!

75
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:22,096
What's she doing now?

76
00:04:22,129 --> 00:04:26,000
This is why we're here, Ellie.
To find you some new friends.

77
00:04:26,534 --> 00:04:28,069
Oh, really?

78
00:04:29,537 --> 00:04:31,604
GraceMay11 wants to be
an astronaut, too.

79
00:04:31,638 --> 00:04:33,240
- You wanna friend Ellie?
- Yeah, sure.

80
00:04:33,274 --> 00:04:34,475
Hey, Pete66.

81
00:04:34,508 --> 00:04:35,775
Yes!

82
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:37,411
Pete's a fan
of <i>Danger-Bunny!</i>

83
00:04:37,445 --> 00:04:38,546
- Hi, Ellie. This is so cool!
- Hi!

84
00:04:38,578 --> 00:04:40,081
Yeah, I went
to Space Camp last year!

85
00:04:40,114 --> 00:04:41,614
- Your best friend...
- Awesome!

86
00:04:41,648 --> 00:04:42,715
...out of the box!

87
00:04:42,749 --> 00:04:45,585
Let's do this!

88
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:48,721
Let's make friends!

89
00:04:58,466 --> 00:04:59,500
Barney?

90
00:04:59,533 --> 00:05:02,436
- Yep?
- You have safety vest?

91
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:04,737
- Uh-huh.
- And snack?

92
00:05:05,705 --> 00:05:06,974
Yeah, Gran.

93
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,577
I'll see you later.

94
00:05:13,114 --> 00:05:14,415
Troll! Two o'clock!

95
00:05:14,448 --> 00:05:16,749
Omina mitotae!

96
00:05:16,783 --> 00:05:19,253
- I got you.
- Do you wanna trade spells?

97
00:05:20,687 --> 00:05:22,089
Whoa!

98
00:05:22,123 --> 00:05:23,324
Selfie!

99
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:25,993
Whoo-hoo! Yeah!

100
00:05:28,429 --> 00:05:29,964
Safe to walk.

101
00:05:48,349 --> 00:05:49,350
Wow!

102
00:05:54,787 --> 00:05:56,290
You got eyes, kid?

103
00:05:56,323 --> 00:05:58,159
Sorry. I'm so sorry.

104
00:05:59,226 --> 00:06:00,394
Ah, seriously?

105
00:06:07,635 --> 00:06:08,936
Ninja blast!

106
00:06:08,969 --> 00:06:10,404
Hey, you're a fan, too?

107
00:06:10,437 --> 00:06:12,206
Of course.

108
00:06:12,239 --> 00:06:13,673
- Hey!
- Hey!

109
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:16,709
Look left, Ethan.
Right. Now let us cross.

110
00:06:16,743 --> 00:06:19,313
To the dark side!

111
00:06:20,948 --> 00:06:22,516
You have
nine new messages.

112
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:23,683
You have ten likes.

113
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:24,717
Message Abby,
I'll be there in five.

114
00:06:24,751 --> 00:06:25,920
Jack wants
to friend you.

115
00:06:25,953 --> 00:06:27,021
By Odin's beard,
you have six messages.

116
00:06:27,054 --> 00:06:28,556
- Did you see Ruby's post?
- Sharing.

117
00:06:28,589 --> 00:06:30,757
Hey, Savannah
just followed me.

118
00:06:31,592 --> 00:06:33,260
Isaac accepts
your friendship.

119
00:06:33,294 --> 00:06:36,230
So, you see how the magma
from the upper mantle

120
00:06:36,263 --> 00:06:37,665
pushes up into the chamber.

121
00:06:37,697 --> 00:06:38,798
- That's cool!
- Label chamber.

122
00:06:38,832 --> 00:06:40,634
Guys, guys,
is she coming yet?

123
00:06:40,668 --> 00:06:42,069
- This is going to be crazy.
- She's coming.

124
00:06:42,102 --> 00:06:44,104
- Hey, Savannah!
- Hey, Sav. Cute kicks!

125
00:06:44,138 --> 00:06:46,540
Thank you.
Hey, guys. Savannah here.

126
00:06:46,574 --> 00:06:48,042
So, later I wanna
talk to you guys

127
00:06:48,075 --> 00:06:49,643
about plastics in the ocean,

128
00:06:49,677 --> 00:06:51,545
and this new great blowout.

129
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:54,014
Ooh.

130
00:06:54,048 --> 00:06:55,849
- Lame, Rich.
- Top quality footage.

131
00:06:55,883 --> 00:06:57,685
Like and subscribe...

132
00:06:57,717 --> 00:06:58,919
Posting to your channel.

133
00:06:59,687 --> 00:07:02,489
Weep, trollboy, I am fire!

134
00:07:10,965 --> 00:07:12,833
Nothing to see here.

135
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:18,239
Wow, Barney.
It's your birthday.

136
00:07:18,272 --> 00:07:20,307
And you still
didn't get a B-Bot?

137
00:07:20,341 --> 00:07:21,774
<i>Thanks
for breaking that down.</i>

138
00:07:21,809 --> 00:07:23,010
Barney is having a party.

139
00:07:23,043 --> 00:07:25,546
- Really?
- Uh, no, no, no.

140
00:07:28,115 --> 00:07:31,252
Fly free, little one. Phoosh!

141
00:07:31,285 --> 00:07:32,219
You okay, Barney?

142
00:07:32,253 --> 00:07:34,588
Yeah. Oh, sorry.
I'm in your shot.

143
00:07:34,622 --> 00:07:38,292
That's so sweet.
But I have a filter for that.

144
00:07:39,493 --> 00:07:40,594
<i>Ciao.</i>

145
00:07:40,628 --> 00:07:42,496
This is your girl,
signing off.

146
00:07:42,529 --> 00:07:43,530
Love you, guys.

147
00:08:02,016 --> 00:08:05,085
- Create Sav's group chat.
- Check for Science Squad.

148
00:08:06,387 --> 00:08:09,223
Okay.

149
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:20,234
<i>Okay.
18 minutes of recess hell.</i>

150
00:08:20,267 --> 00:08:21,535
<i>You have got this!</i>

151
00:08:27,908 --> 00:08:29,610
<i>Maybe not.</i>

152
00:08:29,643 --> 00:08:31,645
- Barney!
- Oh, no.

153
00:08:31,679 --> 00:08:32,880
All alone again?

154
00:08:32,913 --> 00:08:34,148
No, I'm good. I just...

155
00:08:34,181 --> 00:08:35,482
- On your birthday?
- <i>No, no, no...</i>

156
00:08:35,516 --> 00:08:37,985
<i>You have to be kidding me.
Who told her?</i>

157
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:39,920
Your grandma called
the school.

158
00:08:39,953 --> 00:08:41,755
I just need to go...

159
00:08:41,789 --> 00:08:44,425
I forgot my, uh, inhaler.

160
00:08:45,092 --> 00:08:47,628
The other one.

161
00:08:47,661 --> 00:08:50,764
- Got it. You need to sit down.
- Huh?

162
00:08:54,168 --> 00:08:56,103
This is gonna work, Barney.
You'll see.

163
00:08:56,136 --> 00:08:57,705
- It really won't.
- Yes, it will.

164
00:08:57,738 --> 00:08:59,373
It kind of makes things
a lot worse.

165
00:08:59,406 --> 00:09:00,908
- Wow.
- Brutal, man.

166
00:09:00,941 --> 00:09:03,410
Come on.
Bring it in, brave soldier.

167
00:09:03,444 --> 00:09:04,778
Whoa... What?

168
00:09:06,647 --> 00:09:08,649
- Oh, ho ho!
- Bring it in, Barney.

169
00:09:08,682 --> 00:09:09,750
Come on, Barney boy.

170
00:09:09,783 --> 00:09:10,884
Bring it in.

171
00:09:10,918 --> 00:09:13,020
<i>Wow.
How low can a kid go?</i>

172
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:17,257
Now, when someone comes along,
talk to them about a hobby.

173
00:09:17,291 --> 00:09:19,760
Didn't you write me an essay
on rock collecting?

174
00:09:19,793 --> 00:09:20,994
Yeah. No.

175
00:09:21,028 --> 00:09:23,731
Will you go talk to Barney?
He loves rocks.

176
00:09:23,764 --> 00:09:26,400
He needs friends.
It's his birthday.

177
00:09:26,433 --> 00:09:27,534
<i>Kill me now.</i>

178
00:09:28,669 --> 00:09:29,970
Happy birthday!

179
00:09:30,003 --> 00:09:32,841
Ha-ha. Miss Thomas said
you wanna talk about rocks?

180
00:09:32,873 --> 00:09:34,074
Who likes rocks?

181
00:09:34,108 --> 00:09:36,744
So, you're into rocks?
That's nice.

182
00:09:36,777 --> 00:09:38,178
Uh...

183
00:09:38,212 --> 00:09:40,447
Seriously?
Dude, it's your birthday

184
00:09:40,481 --> 00:09:42,249
and you still didn't get
a B-Bot?

185
00:09:42,282 --> 00:09:44,418
Maybe he doesn't want a B-Bot.

186
00:09:44,451 --> 00:09:46,720
Maybe he prefers rocks.

187
00:09:46,754 --> 00:09:49,757
Hey. You're a rock star,
Barney.

188
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:50,924
- Oh, snap.
- Ha-ha! You get it?

189
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:54,194
Who's your favorite
movie star? The Rock?

190
00:09:54,228 --> 00:09:55,662
- Killer, Rich.
- Ha-ha-ha!

191
00:09:55,696 --> 00:09:56,831
You rock, man!

192
00:09:56,865 --> 00:09:58,799
Just gets funnier
and funnier.

193
00:09:58,833 --> 00:10:01,602
- Oh, hey, Barney.
- Can we rock up at your house?

194
00:10:01,635 --> 00:10:02,669
That's funny, Rich.

195
00:10:02,703 --> 00:10:04,938
Check out your awesome
rock collection?

196
00:10:08,909 --> 00:10:10,978
<i>No, Rich.</i>

197
00:10:11,011 --> 00:10:13,981
<i>I'm afraid you can't come
to my house.</i>

198
00:10:14,014 --> 00:10:15,949
<i>For some reason.</i>

199
00:10:21,321 --> 00:10:23,991
Come on! Get off! Hey!

200
00:10:24,024 --> 00:10:25,993
It's my birthday,
you dumb goat.

201
00:10:26,026 --> 00:10:28,295
Sorry, are we
on the line? Is that...

202
00:10:28,328 --> 00:10:29,530
Yes, hello!

203
00:10:29,563 --> 00:10:31,064
So, today, Mr. Takahashi,

204
00:10:31,098 --> 00:10:33,400
Pudowski Novelty
Exports International

205
00:10:33,434 --> 00:10:37,137
are very excited to offer you
this highly amusing novelty,

206
00:10:37,171 --> 00:10:39,039
the Brother Bouncy car monk.

207
00:10:39,072 --> 00:10:40,407
He wiggles, he bounces,

208
00:10:40,441 --> 00:10:41,708
- he's got...
- <i>Uh... No.</i>

209
00:10:41,742 --> 00:10:43,944
- He'll hold your phone.
- <i>Uh...</i>

210
00:10:44,578 --> 00:10:46,447
Oh, hi, Barney. Good day?

211
00:10:46,747 --> 00:10:48,081
Uh...

212
00:10:48,115 --> 00:10:51,051
Mr. Takahashi?
Are you there? Hello?

213
00:10:51,084 --> 00:10:54,154
Mom, did you unplug
my router again? I had Tokyo!

214
00:10:54,188 --> 00:10:56,423
I need this contract.

215
00:10:58,492 --> 00:11:00,727
Sure. It was fine.

216
00:11:00,761 --> 00:11:02,663
Barney!

217
00:11:02,696 --> 00:11:04,264
Mr. Takahashi? Hello?

218
00:11:04,298 --> 00:11:05,532
<i>♪ Happy birthday to you ♪</i>

00:11:10,204 --> 00:11:12,072
- Graham.

225
00:11:20,547 --> 00:11:21,950
For my lovely boy.

226
00:11:21,982 --> 00:11:23,350
Thanks, Gran! Ow!

227
00:11:23,383 --> 00:11:24,384
Oops!

228
00:11:24,418 --> 00:11:27,688
Made with love.
And our own goat wool.

229
00:11:27,721 --> 00:11:29,590
And from me...

230
00:11:29,623 --> 00:11:31,391
- <i>Could it be?</i>
- Wait for it.

231
00:11:31,425 --> 00:11:33,293
<i>Is there
any possible way?</i>

232
00:11:36,697 --> 00:11:38,098
Wow. Rock hammers.

233
00:11:38,131 --> 00:11:39,700
You always
did love your rocks.

234
00:11:39,733 --> 00:11:43,270
Yeah, I did. Always. Used to.

235
00:11:43,303 --> 00:11:45,205
- Thanks, Dad.
- And Gran.

236
00:11:45,239 --> 00:11:48,609
I just... The goats' wool
and my allergies.

237
00:11:48,642 --> 00:11:49,476
Oh, no, no, no.

238
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:51,011
No one in Pudowski family
have allergy.

239
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:52,279
What about Uncle Boris?

240
00:11:52,312 --> 00:11:55,549
He was possessed.
By a demon in a cashew.

241
00:11:55,582 --> 00:11:56,450
I don't know, Mom.

242
00:11:56,483 --> 00:11:59,086
What time your friends come,
Barney?

243
00:11:59,119 --> 00:12:01,121
- I cook all day.
- Wow!

244
00:12:01,154 --> 00:12:02,623
This real food.

245
00:12:02,656 --> 00:12:04,424
Yum! Schkembe!

246
00:12:04,458 --> 00:12:06,426
Bet your friends
never had tripe soup before.

247
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:09,563
Ooh! I put on Zany Bogomil!

248
00:12:09,596 --> 00:12:12,132
Like last time we had party,
remember?

249
00:12:12,165 --> 00:12:14,368
When you were six.

250
00:12:29,216 --> 00:12:31,084
All right.

251
00:12:31,118 --> 00:12:34,688
Um, actually, the thing is...

252
00:12:35,722 --> 00:12:38,927
No one's coming to the party.

253
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,294
No one?

254
00:12:40,527 --> 00:12:41,328
Huh?

255
00:12:41,361 --> 00:12:44,665
You ask and all say no?

256
00:12:44,698 --> 00:12:49,369
Son, we're
a little worried about you.

257
00:12:49,403 --> 00:12:53,774
You... You never go out with
anyone or have friends over.

258
00:12:53,808 --> 00:12:54,943
You know,
that's why we thought

259
00:12:54,976 --> 00:12:56,276
invite the whole class!

260
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:58,378
Get the whole gang
over here, right?

261
00:12:58,412 --> 00:13:00,581
You know. Get you in the swing
of things with everybody.

262
00:13:00,614 --> 00:13:03,417
I make food
for all your buddies.

263
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:05,118
I don't really have...

264
00:13:06,988 --> 00:13:10,157
You know, they probably
just didn't read the invites.

265
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:13,594
No one does paper these days.
They send messages

266
00:13:13,627 --> 00:13:15,662
with their B-Bots.

267
00:13:15,696 --> 00:13:16,864
Really? You need a B-Bot

268
00:13:16,898 --> 00:13:18,398
to have a social life
these days?

269
00:13:18,432 --> 00:13:20,367
- Eh, pfft!
- Yeah, Dad, kind of.

270
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:23,470
No. I don't want you addicted
to some device.

271
00:13:23,503 --> 00:13:25,339
You should be out there
in the woods.

272
00:13:25,372 --> 00:13:26,773
Kicking around with a buddy.

273
00:13:28,076 --> 00:13:30,143
Get out there, Barn. Interact.

274
00:13:30,177 --> 00:13:32,080
You don't wanna spend
your whole life

275
00:13:32,112 --> 00:13:34,681
glued to a...

276
00:13:34,715 --> 00:13:35,749
- B-Bots.
- What?

277
00:13:35,782 --> 00:13:36,985
It just a craze

278
00:13:37,018 --> 00:13:39,620
- and they cost a fortune.
- Mm-hmm.

279
00:13:39,653 --> 00:13:44,658
Yeah. Yeah, you're right.
It's... it's a waste of money.

280
00:13:44,691 --> 00:13:45,994
No big deal.

281
00:13:46,027 --> 00:13:48,595
Bubble delivery.

282
00:13:51,598 --> 00:13:53,433
What? It can't be!

283
00:13:53,467 --> 00:13:55,903
Dad, you were kidding me!

284
00:13:55,937 --> 00:13:59,706
I knew you wouldn't just give
me rock hammers. I knew it!

285
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:02,175
Oh. A rock.

286
00:14:04,946 --> 00:14:08,049
<i>♪ We will, we will rock you ♪</i>

287
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:10,417
Yo, I got
the whole thing, bro.

288
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:13,720
It was hilarious, Barn.
You thought it was a B-Bot.

289
00:14:14,655 --> 00:14:15,789
A B-Bot?

290
00:14:15,823 --> 00:14:17,324
Let it go, Rich.

291
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:19,226
You get out of here.

292
00:14:19,259 --> 00:14:22,329
You want I pour hot chicken
fat down your pants!

293
00:14:23,163 --> 00:14:25,399
Barney, what's going on?

294
00:14:25,432 --> 00:14:28,602
It's okay, Dad. Really.

295
00:14:29,236 --> 00:14:30,838
These are great.

296
00:14:37,644 --> 00:14:40,414
I hope they're not closed.

297
00:14:40,447 --> 00:14:42,649
B-Bot, B-Bot.

298
00:14:42,683 --> 00:14:45,619
Get him something useful
like a snow shovel.

299
00:14:46,586 --> 00:14:48,722
Or a cordless drill.

300
00:14:48,755 --> 00:14:51,458
It's what he really wanted.

301
00:14:51,491 --> 00:14:55,362
If his mom were alive,
she'd have known that.

302
00:15:00,134 --> 00:15:01,401
- Mom, people!
- Ooh!

303
00:15:01,435 --> 00:15:02,904
- People!
- Crazy lady!

304
00:15:02,937 --> 00:15:04,538
Whoa!

305
00:15:04,571 --> 00:15:05,739
Whoo!

306
00:15:05,772 --> 00:15:07,741
It's okay. It's fine.

307
00:15:07,774 --> 00:15:08,876
Whoa, whoa!

308
00:15:11,079 --> 00:15:13,213
Perfect!

309
00:15:14,182 --> 00:15:15,515
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.

310
00:15:15,549 --> 00:15:18,019
- Argh! No, no, no.
- No! No, wait.

311
00:15:18,052 --> 00:15:19,352
- Hi! Please...
- Lady!

312
00:15:19,386 --> 00:15:22,622
...hold on just a second.
Uh, it's my son's birthday.

313
00:15:22,656 --> 00:15:25,525
I need a B-Bot.

314
00:15:25,559 --> 00:15:27,895
Maybe just the basic model?

315
00:15:29,329 --> 00:15:30,597
No, no, no.

316
00:15:31,398 --> 00:15:32,967
Hang on, please.
Please, please.

317
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,269
I throw in goat.
Goat for a B-Bot.

318
00:15:36,303 --> 00:15:38,238
She real friend.

319
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:40,474
And when you get bored
of this one,

320
00:15:40,507 --> 00:15:42,442
krrr, you can eat her!

321
00:15:42,476 --> 00:15:44,946
- Less waste, good for planet.
- Yeah.

322
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,115
What?

323
00:15:47,148 --> 00:15:49,217
No. No, no, no. Come on.

324
00:15:49,249 --> 00:15:50,617
Three month wait?

325
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:53,054
What is this?
Stalinist Russia?

326
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:55,857
I am not afraid of you,
Bubble booble!

327
00:16:04,731 --> 00:16:05,833
What do you got
for me, pal?

328
00:16:05,867 --> 00:16:07,667
We got five pads
and some phones.

329
00:16:07,701 --> 00:16:09,137
Yeah?
What about that one?

330
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:11,939
Uh, that one fell out
of my van earlier.

331
00:16:20,714 --> 00:16:22,716
Happy late birthday,
Barney.

332
00:16:25,153 --> 00:16:28,688
Wha... Dad! Oh, Dad!

333
00:16:28,722 --> 00:16:29,589
You got me one!

334
00:16:29,623 --> 00:16:32,459
- A real one this time!
- Yeah, I can see!

335
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:35,129
Thank you, thank you,
thank you so much! And Gran.

336
00:16:35,163 --> 00:16:36,898
- Mwah, mwah.
- Oh, you good boy!

337
00:16:36,931 --> 00:16:40,201
Hey, if you hurry,
you can take it to school.

338
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:50,710
Here we go.

339
00:16:54,882 --> 00:16:55,950
Huh?

340
00:17:07,061 --> 00:17:08,029
Uh...

341
00:17:08,562 --> 00:17:09,529
Huh?

342
00:17:12,099 --> 00:17:13,500
What?

343
00:17:21,641 --> 00:17:22,709
Seriously?

344
00:17:24,344 --> 00:17:25,880
Come on, come on!

345
00:17:28,049 --> 00:17:30,284
No. What? Why?

346
00:17:30,318 --> 00:17:32,320
Barney, school time!

347
00:17:49,603 --> 00:17:51,906
Hi. Insert registered name,

348
00:17:51,939 --> 00:17:55,243
I am your...

00:17:55,276 --> 00:17:56,576
I am...

350
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:58,813
My B-Bot.

351
00:17:58,846 --> 00:18:00,614
B-Bot.

352
00:18:01,481 --> 00:18:03,750
Look! My best friend
out of the box?

353
00:18:05,019 --> 00:18:07,787
I am, insert registered name's
best friend out of my box.

354
00:18:07,822 --> 00:18:10,390
Insert registered name
is my best friend.

355
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:12,559
Please connect me
to the Bubble network.

356
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:14,728
Uh, how? You're not online?

357
00:18:14,761 --> 00:18:16,063
How am I supposed to fix that?

358
00:18:16,097 --> 00:18:17,131
No problem.

359
00:18:17,164 --> 00:18:19,867
I'll scan my database
to find out how to do it.

360
00:18:19,901 --> 00:18:21,501

- Hi! Absalom?

371
00:18:44,292 --> 00:18:45,659
I am Absalom's B-Bot.

372
00:18:45,692 --> 00:18:50,064
No, no, no. My name is Barney.

373
00:18:50,097 --> 00:18:51,631

374

Where are you going?

386
00:19:21,528 --> 00:19:22,762
Abu Dhabi,

387
00:19:22,796 --> 00:19:23,831
- Addis Ababa, Amsterdam...
- You're supposed to stay

388
00:19:23,864 --> 00:19:25,933
- within six feet of me.
- Arizona.

389
00:19:28,768 --> 00:19:30,204
Six...

390
00:19:30,237 --> 00:19:31,705
I'm so sorry.

391
00:19:31,738 --> 00:19:33,808

- What are you doing?

392
00:19:33,841 --> 00:19:36,277

- You walked under a truck!

393
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:37,345
Hi. Absalom?

394
00:19:37,378 --> 00:19:38,846
What about
your traffic sensors?

395
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:41,282
What is a truck?
Is it an airplane,

396
00:19:41,315 --> 00:19:42,682
an ambulance, an alligator,

397
00:19:42,716 --> 00:19:44,018
- an aardvark?
- Come on!

398
00:19:44,051 --> 00:19:45,186
We gotta get to school!

399
00:19:45,219 --> 00:19:46,253

400
00:19:46,287 --> 00:19:47,554
You don't know
what school is?

401
00:19:47,587 --> 00:19:50,257

How come you don't know that?

404
00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:02,903
You're supposed to know
everything about me!

405
00:20:02,937 --> 00:20:04,972
I'm supposed to know

406

407

Whoa, whoa!

408
00:20:10,011 --> 00:20:13,114
Hey, no, no, no. I'll take you
to school tomorrow. Okay?

409
00:20:14,215 --> 00:20:16,549
Stay here and learn stuff.

410
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:18,518
Just stay.

411
00:20:18,853 --> 00:20:20,087

412
00:20:20,488 --> 00:20:23,623

Don't focus on the negative.

431
00:21:10,304 --> 00:21:12,506
I could follow you, Ava.

432
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:14,741
I... I got a B-Bot.
It's just...

433
00:21:14,774 --> 00:21:18,846
It's at home, um, downloading
my profile.

434
00:21:19,814 --> 00:21:20,881
Okay.

- <i>No.</i>

440
00:21:42,303 --> 00:21:43,871
I got a huge warehouse
full of these things.

441
00:21:43,904 --> 00:21:45,439
I can give you

442

Hey, buddy. How's the B-Bot?

443
00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:49,977

462
00:22:35,788 --> 00:22:37,091
I know your underpants combust

463

at a temperature
of 232 degrees Fahrenheit.

464
00:22:40,161 --> 00:22:42,329
Seventeen degrees

466
00:22:44,532 --> 00:22:46,233

- I know you have 11 socks

467
00:22:46,267 --> 00:22:48,369
and four books detailing
the life of Bill the Bus.

468
00:22:48,402 --> 00:22:51,605
Now, I'm your best friend
out of the box, Absalom!

469
00:22:51,639 --> 00:22:54,108
No! A friend does not
go through your stuff

470
00:22:54,141 --> 00:22:58,812
or burn it or melt it
or dismember Mr. Bunky.

471
00:22:58,846 --> 00:22:59,980
Removing Mr. Bunky's head

472
00:23:00,014 --> 00:23:02,749
required a breaking point
of 7.6 newton.

473
00:23:02,782 --> 00:23:05,252
Stop! What is wrong with you?
Gran!

474
00:23:05,286 --> 00:23:06,353
Gran is 78.

475
00:23:06,387 --> 00:23:07,655
A former anti-communist

476
00:23:07,687 --> 00:23:09,523
with an approximate
weight mass of 360...

477
00:23:09,557 --> 00:23:11,425
Whoa-ho-ho! No, no. Cheeky.

478
00:23:15,496 --> 00:23:17,198
The B-Bot.

479
00:23:17,231 --> 00:23:18,933
There's something wrong
with it, Gran.

480
00:23:18,966 --> 00:23:20,201
It look all right
to me.

481
00:23:20,234 --> 00:23:21,635
It's not meant
to do that.

482
00:23:21,669 --> 00:23:22,937
I'm not meant to do that.

483
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:24,638
Just like
all the others.

484
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:29,343
Maybe turn it off
and on again?

485
00:23:31,011 --> 00:23:33,881
No! It just...
It doesn't work properly.

486
00:23:33,914 --> 00:23:36,150
44, 45, 40...

487
00:23:37,784 --> 00:23:41,655
I fix it! Pudowskis make do
and mend.

488
00:23:41,689 --> 00:23:44,158
Oh, if I just ram this
up power outlet...

489
00:23:44,191 --> 00:23:45,259
No!

490
00:23:45,292 --> 00:23:46,627
You'll make it worse!

491
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:47,995
Oh, Barney.

492
00:23:48,028 --> 00:23:51,232
Once, I mend my own hernia
with bread knife and vodka.

493
00:23:51,265 --> 00:23:53,800
People don't mend stuff
anymore, Gran.

494
00:23:53,834 --> 00:23:55,302
They just take it back and...

495
00:23:55,336 --> 00:23:58,072
Take it back?

496
00:23:58,105 --> 00:24:00,975
You want I tell your father
it not good enough?

497
00:24:01,008 --> 00:24:01,909
No!

498
00:24:01,942 --> 00:24:03,944
That... No. But...

499
00:24:03,978 --> 00:24:05,479
...what am I gonna do?

500
00:24:05,512 --> 00:24:08,549
Ah. Take it outside.

What is this?

00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:41,875
I am Absalom's B-Bot.

540
00:25:41,909 --> 00:25:44,511
Look! It's naked.

541
00:25:44,545 --> 00:25:46,613
Yo, I can see its ro-butt.

542
00:25:46,647 --> 00:25:47,748
- Ro-butt.
- Get it?

543
00:25:47,781 --> 00:25:49,350
'Cause it's a robot. It's...

545
00:25:51,685 --> 00:25:53,420
Would you give it back,
please?

Barney?

Barnacle.

548
00:25:56,857 --> 00:25:58,392
I'm taking it back
to the store.

549
00:25:58,425 --> 00:25:59,927
Just please give it back.

550
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:02,831
Yeah, sure, Barn. Take it.

something for me.

552
00:26:13,574 --> 00:26:14,809
- Uh, sorry?
- Yeah.

553
00:26:14,843 --> 00:26:16,276
Your gran rang the school.

554
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:18,779
You got me in trouble.
That's your fault, man.

555
00:26:18,813 --> 00:26:19,980
Your fault, dude.

556
00:26:20,013 --> 00:26:22,182

- So, come on. Cheer us up.

00:27:30,852 --> 00:27:34,388
My resin skin tenses on impact

633
00:29:12,219 --> 00:29:14,621
But, oh, man!
You hit Rich Belcher!

634

I don't get it.
B-Bots can't hurt people.

safety controls and stuff.

for a good one.

642
00:29:37,344 --> 00:29:39,680
and maybe I...

643
00:29:39,713 --> 00:29:41,682

That B-Bot is ours!

655
00:30:02,436 --> 00:30:04,171
- It's a lunatic!
- It's just dancing.

656
00:30:04,204 --> 00:30:05,873
- I taught it.
- I paid for that.

657
00:30:05,907 --> 00:30:06,975
It was just doing what I said.

658
00:30:07,008 --> 00:30:08,342
Take it away! It's crazy!

659
00:30:08,375 --> 00:30:09,877
At least
I'm not Uncle Boris.

00:30:09,911 --> 00:30:11,778
I'm... I'm sure
it's just a minor issue.

661
00:30:11,813 --> 00:30:14,949
It's violent, uncontrollable,
and highly dangerous.

662
00:30:14,983 --> 00:30:16,583
Okay, great.
Let me look into that.

663
00:30:16,617 --> 00:30:18,987
No. There's nothing wrong
with him.

664
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:20,253
It assaulted a child!

665
00:30:20,287 --> 00:30:21,588
It didn't assault him.

666
00:30:21,622 --> 00:30:23,825
I hit Rich Belcher.
It was awesome, but terrible,

667
00:30:23,858 --> 00:30:25,026
- but awesome.
- See?

668
00:30:25,059 --> 00:30:26,995
- Barney... You were fighting?
- No!

669
00:30:27,028 --> 00:30:29,097
B-Bots
are incapable of violence.

00:30:29,129 --> 00:30:30,999
- Boink!

671
00:30:31,032 --> 00:30:32,165

I don't even know his name.

674
00:30:34,902 --> 00:30:36,804
Yes, you do! It's Absalom.

675
00:30:36,838 --> 00:30:38,438
- Hi, Absalom.
- What?

676
00:30:38,472 --> 00:30:41,575
According to our records,
it has no registered owner.

677
00:30:41,608 --> 00:30:44,012
- But I give all my funeral money...
- Mom...

678
00:30:44,045 --> 00:30:45,445
- ...to that man in the alley.
- ...please.

679
00:30:45,479 --> 00:30:47,115
You got it
from a man in an alley?

680
00:30:47,147 --> 00:30:49,117
Did you obtain
this bot illegally?

681
00:30:49,149 --> 00:30:50,384
What?

682
00:30:50,417 --> 00:30:52,820
This took a turn,
and we gotta get out of here.

683
00:30:52,854 --> 00:30:54,454
Send it to the crusher!

684
00:30:54,488 --> 00:30:55,555
- What?
- For all we know,

685
00:30:55,589 --> 00:30:56,723
it could kill someone.

686
00:30:56,757 --> 00:31:00,193
No. It's mine.
It was my birthday present.

687
00:31:00,227 --> 00:31:02,562
We'll return it to the
facility, run some tests.

688
00:31:02,596 --> 00:31:04,164
Do you want me to close
the whole store?

689
00:31:04,197 --> 00:31:07,567
No, no, no.
Uh, one crushing coming up!

690
00:31:07,601 --> 00:31:09,703
Use the recycler.

691
00:31:09,736 --> 00:31:11,139

<i>Arrivederci. Auf Wiedersehen.</i>

00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:14,274
No, you can't do that.

694
00:31:14,307 --> 00:31:16,243
Dad, please.
It was sticking up for me.

695
00:31:16,276 --> 00:31:18,079
Barney, we gotta let it go.

696
00:31:18,112 --> 00:31:19,446
Let's take some details.

697
00:31:19,479 --> 00:31:20,915
- What was your name, sir?
- Uh...

698
00:31:20,948 --> 00:31:23,283
Absalom, will crushing be fun?

699
00:31:35,063 --> 00:31:36,229
Phew.

700
00:31:37,631 --> 00:31:38,565
- Hi, Absalom.
- Shh.

701
00:31:38,598 --> 00:31:40,333
- Happy birthday!
- What are you doing?

702
00:31:40,367 --> 00:31:42,302
A friend must stay
within six feet.

703
00:31:42,335 --> 00:31:43,770
We'll go
to the crusher together.

704
00:31:43,805 --> 00:31:47,607
No! Crushing is not fun!
It means smushed, flattened...

705
00:31:47,641 --> 00:31:49,242
Uh... Uh...

706
00:31:49,276 --> 00:31:50,510
A... A... A...

707
00:31:51,445 --> 00:31:53,246
Think, think, think.

708
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:54,882
Annihilated.

709
00:31:59,087 --> 00:32:01,421
- Annihilated. Not fun!
- Shh.

710
00:32:01,455 --> 00:32:03,191
We gotta get out of here.

711
00:32:03,223 --> 00:32:04,591
Where are you...? Ow.

712
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:08,562
Hey, stop! Hey!

713
00:32:08,595 --> 00:32:10,263
We gotta get out of here.

714
00:32:10,297 --> 00:32:11,498
No. Come back.

715
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:13,868
- Whoa.
- Sorry.

716
00:32:13,901 --> 00:32:17,138
- Where are you going?
- You said, "Come back."

717
00:32:20,975 --> 00:32:21,976
Sorry, again.

718
00:32:22,844 --> 00:32:24,478
Bree, it got out!

719
00:32:29,282 --> 00:32:30,952
Sorry!

720
00:32:30,985 --> 00:32:32,285
- Where is it?
- <i>Ay!</i>

721
00:32:32,319 --> 00:32:34,922
Lucha libre, third floor.

722
00:32:37,357 --> 00:32:40,161
- Stop!
- Oh, no.

723
00:32:40,194 --> 00:32:41,795
Space! Final frontier!

724
00:32:45,298 --> 00:32:46,600
Whew!

725
00:32:48,602 --> 00:32:49,569
Uh-oh.

726
00:32:50,104 --> 00:32:52,206
Follow me!

727
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,740
Sorry, he's with me.

728
00:32:53,774 --> 00:32:54,976
He is unaffected!

729
00:32:55,009 --> 00:32:56,043
Invincible one.

730
00:32:56,077 --> 00:32:57,344
Space Lord.

731
00:32:57,912 --> 00:32:59,847
Hi, I am insane.

732
00:33:01,314 --> 00:33:03,316
Follow me.

733
00:33:05,953 --> 00:33:07,955
Are we having fun with me?

734
00:33:08,688 --> 00:33:10,091
You bet!

735
00:33:12,994 --> 00:33:14,528
You have to find it.

736
00:33:14,561 --> 00:33:17,131
It's gotta be here somewhere.
Keep looking.

737
00:33:17,165 --> 00:33:19,399
Huh?

738
00:33:20,101 --> 00:33:21,202
Where is he?

739
00:33:21,235 --> 00:33:23,336
Where did they go?

740
00:33:23,370 --> 00:33:26,207
Hi, I'm Sally Squirrel.

741
00:33:27,707 --> 00:33:30,710
- Potty time! Sing with me!
- No! Shush!

742
00:33:30,744 --> 00:33:31,778
You are dead meat.

743
00:33:31,813 --> 00:33:32,814
Preschool forest.

744
00:33:32,847 --> 00:33:34,414
<i>♪ Number one or number two ♪</i>

745
00:33:34,447 --> 00:33:36,184
<i>♪ Let's learn
where we pee and poo ♪</i>

746
00:33:36,217 --> 00:33:37,784
Power down, power down!

747
00:33:40,221 --> 00:33:44,025
Okay, everybody out.
Paws in the air.

748
00:33:44,058 --> 00:33:45,759
I know you're in there.

749
00:33:58,438 --> 00:34:00,440
Ugh! Really.

750
00:34:00,473 --> 00:34:02,509
- Barney!
- I'm sorry.

751
00:34:11,651 --> 00:34:13,221
How dare you! Are you
calling me a criminal?

752
00:34:13,254 --> 00:34:14,255
- Mom, no, no, no.
- You're not helping.

753
00:34:14,288 --> 00:34:16,690
I paid for it!

754
00:34:16,723 --> 00:34:19,593
- Hi, Absalom.
- Shh!

755
00:34:19,626 --> 00:34:21,695
I'm gonna take you home, okay?

756
00:34:21,728 --> 00:34:24,065
But you get
to choose your friends.

757
00:34:24,098 --> 00:34:25,365
And you don't choose me.

758
00:34:26,466 --> 00:34:29,337
I do, okay. I choose you.

759
00:34:29,369 --> 00:34:32,206
I can fix you, like Gran said,

760
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:36,177
and I'll teach you
how to be my friend.

761
00:34:36,210 --> 00:34:37,979
Okay, Absalom.

762
00:34:38,012 --> 00:34:39,080
Okay.

763
00:34:39,113 --> 00:34:42,415
My registered name is Absalom,

764
00:34:42,449 --> 00:34:45,152
but my friends call me Barney.

765
00:34:46,254 --> 00:34:47,754
My friends call me...

766
00:34:48,990 --> 00:34:50,390
Ron Bintscatsco.

767
00:34:50,423 --> 00:34:53,160
Okay, Ron.

768
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,196
Okay, Barney.

769
00:34:55,229 --> 00:34:56,264
One day parking ticket,

770
00:34:56,297 --> 00:34:57,397
next day firing squad.

771
00:34:57,430 --> 00:34:58,665
No, that's not
gonna be a problem.

772
00:34:58,698 --> 00:35:02,069
Hey, Barn. I am so sorry
about the B-Bot.

773
00:35:02,103 --> 00:35:03,137
I'll figure something out.

774
00:35:03,170 --> 00:35:04,504
It's okay, Dad. Not a problem.

775
00:35:05,639 --> 00:35:07,842
I... I think
it's gonna be fine.

776
00:35:11,979 --> 00:35:15,950
93, 94, 95, 96,

777
00:35:15,983 --> 00:35:19,020
97, 98, 99!

778
00:35:23,357 --> 00:35:26,060
One hundred
million units sold!

779
00:35:26,093 --> 00:35:27,627
Whoo! Yeah!

780
00:35:27,661 --> 00:35:30,463
Well, we made
100 million new friends,

781
00:35:30,497 --> 00:35:33,000
all helping kids connect,
meet each other,

782
00:35:33,034 --> 00:35:35,502
- interact.
- And all through their B-Bots.

783
00:35:35,535 --> 00:35:37,171
Making friends face-to-face?

784
00:35:37,204 --> 00:35:38,538
So last three millennia.

785
00:35:38,571 --> 00:35:39,606
That's not what...

786
00:35:39,639 --> 00:35:40,841
Some kids check in
with their bots

787
00:35:40,875 --> 00:35:43,710
a hundred times a day,
plus 11 times overnight.

788
00:35:43,743 --> 00:35:46,646
We've finally done it.
We've ended sleep.

789
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:48,883
Uh, the algorithm
may need adjusting.

790
00:35:48,916 --> 00:35:50,483
Think of the data
we can harvest!

791
00:35:50,517 --> 00:35:51,953
No, no, no. I designed them...

792
00:35:51,986 --> 00:35:54,288
- In my garage.
- ...for making friends.

793
00:35:54,322 --> 00:35:55,722
Into dollars.

794
00:35:55,755 --> 00:35:57,557
If our share price
goes any higher,

795
00:35:57,590 --> 00:35:59,492
we'll have to give it
a space suit.

796
00:35:59,526 --> 00:36:03,130
So what about the B-Bot
that punched a child?

797
00:36:06,267 --> 00:36:07,902
It hit a cop?

798
00:36:07,935 --> 00:36:09,070
<i>And a child.</i>

799
00:36:09,103 --> 00:36:11,604
It hit a cop.
We can't put that on the box.

800
00:36:11,638 --> 00:36:14,507
No, no. B-Bots are incapable
of violence.

801
00:36:14,541 --> 00:36:16,543
My algorithm
totally ensures no...

802
00:36:16,576 --> 00:36:18,511
- <i>Ow! Ow!</i>
- <i>Ow! Ow!</i>

803
00:36:19,546 --> 00:36:21,581
- I better look into that.
- You think?

804
00:36:21,614 --> 00:36:24,285
I mean, what if someone
gets injured?

805
00:36:24,318 --> 00:36:26,120
I, for one, could not live

806
00:36:26,153 --> 00:36:28,722
with what that would do
to our share price.

807
00:36:28,755 --> 00:36:29,991
<i>It's not a problem.</i>

808
00:36:30,024 --> 00:36:32,860
<i>We performed a complimentary
in-store crushing.</i>

809
00:36:32,893 --> 00:36:34,195
Good! Uh...

810
00:36:34,228 --> 00:36:36,998
Because if that
was still out there,

811
00:36:37,365 --> 00:36:38,631
we'd be toast.

812
00:36:39,266 --> 00:36:40,533
Uh...

813
00:36:45,006 --> 00:36:47,707
Shh. Guys, no clucking.

814
00:36:50,444 --> 00:36:53,646
Okay, Ron.
How to be my friend.

815
00:36:56,951 --> 00:36:59,387
A bunch of your code
is missing, right?

816
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:00,787
The settings
have not been uploaded.

817
00:37:00,821 --> 00:37:03,790
So, I'm gonna teach you
to be my friend.

818
00:37:03,824 --> 00:37:05,393
And then
you can come to school.

819
00:37:05,426 --> 00:37:07,428
What is a friend, Barney?

820
00:37:07,461 --> 00:37:10,563
Well, a friend
is a person who, uh,

821
00:37:10,597 --> 00:37:12,299
likes, uh...

822
00:37:12,333 --> 00:37:13,800
Is always... I...

823
00:37:13,834 --> 00:37:15,936
A person who, uh, "likes,
is always, I."

824
00:37:15,970 --> 00:37:18,339
Okay.
Now I'm your best friend.

825
00:37:18,372 --> 00:37:20,508
Hey. Come back.

826
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:23,576
No, no, no. There's a lot more
than that, Ron.

827
00:37:24,544 --> 00:37:26,280
You have to know
everything about me.

828
00:37:26,313 --> 00:37:27,747
You have to like me,
obviously.

829
00:37:27,781 --> 00:37:31,018
Like all the same stuff as me,
and you have to be on my side.

830
00:37:31,052 --> 00:37:33,620
But don't hit people.
Even Rich Belcher.

831
00:37:33,653 --> 00:37:35,755
Hair, brown. Height, 4'11".

832
00:37:35,789 --> 00:37:38,893
5'11" would be better.
You could reach high objects.

833
00:37:38,926 --> 00:37:42,296
Hey. A friend likes
everything about you.

834
00:37:42,329 --> 00:37:43,898
- What?
- Let's go to school.

835
00:37:43,931 --> 00:37:45,900
You don't even know
where school is.

836
00:37:45,933 --> 00:37:49,636
Alice Springs, Allahabad,
Anchorage, Albuquerque.

837
00:37:51,439 --> 00:37:52,739
Ooh. A-ha!

838
00:37:52,772 --> 00:37:55,276
Mom! You're shorting
the power out!

839
00:38:08,122 --> 00:38:09,857
You gotta fit in.

840
00:38:12,026 --> 00:38:12,827
Huh?

841
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:15,463
Likes. Rocks, chess, <i>Pac-Man.</i>

842
00:38:15,496 --> 00:38:16,564
- Bill the Bus.
- No!

843
00:38:16,596 --> 00:38:18,132
That was when I was,
like, two.

844
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:21,535
Toast. But only for breakfast.

845
00:38:21,569 --> 00:38:23,337
Butter on its own.

846
00:38:23,370 --> 00:38:24,604
Mm!

847
00:38:33,547 --> 00:38:37,118
Dislikes. Possums,
musicals, school. Generally.

848
00:38:37,151 --> 00:38:39,053
The BuddyBench.

849
00:38:39,086 --> 00:38:42,123
Eugh! Worms. I don't trust
anything without a face.

850
00:38:47,394 --> 00:38:48,529
Stop!

851
00:38:48,562 --> 00:38:50,164
I am fitting in!

852
00:38:52,366 --> 00:38:54,001
You must always stay
within six feet.

853
00:38:54,034 --> 00:38:56,303
I will always stay
within six feet.

854
00:38:56,337 --> 00:38:57,505
Unless I say not to.

855
00:38:57,538 --> 00:38:59,573
I am not to stay
within six feet.

856
00:38:59,607 --> 00:39:01,475
No, no. Sometimes, yes.

857
00:39:01,509 --> 00:39:02,742
- Sometimes.
- And sometimes, no.

858
00:39:02,775 --> 00:39:04,612
- Yes.
- Like, if I had a bad day

859
00:39:04,644 --> 00:39:06,646
- or...
- Bad day. Always six feet.

860
00:39:10,551 --> 00:39:13,753
Allergies.
Goats, wool. Goats' wool.

861
00:39:13,786 --> 00:39:16,223
I'm basically
allergic to life.

862
00:39:16,257 --> 00:39:17,825
That's why I like rocks.

863
00:39:17,858 --> 00:39:19,659
That is sad and also tragic.

864
00:39:19,692 --> 00:39:22,096
What are you into, huh?
Electricity?

865
00:39:22,129 --> 00:39:24,231
Electricity is better
than rocks.

866
00:39:24,265 --> 00:39:26,167
Ron, what are you...

867
00:39:30,737 --> 00:39:34,275
Whoo-hoo-hoo! You got it!
You got the six feet!

868
00:39:38,512 --> 00:39:39,712
Hey! No, no, no. That's...

869
00:39:39,746 --> 00:39:41,182
Barney?

870
00:39:41,215 --> 00:39:43,716
I got a little break.
You wanna do something?

871
00:39:43,750 --> 00:39:45,486
Chess, maybe?

872
00:39:45,519 --> 00:39:47,787
Uh, thanks, Dad. I'm good.

873
00:39:49,056 --> 00:39:50,057
Okay.

874
00:40:06,607 --> 00:40:07,975
- Rocks.
- Electricity.

875
00:40:08,008 --> 00:40:09,610
Rocks are better.

876
00:40:09,643 --> 00:40:11,744
- Electricity.
- Uh, I said rocks.

877
00:40:11,778 --> 00:40:13,547
I prefer electricity.

878
00:40:13,581 --> 00:40:15,449
- Rocks.
- Electricity.

879
00:40:16,283 --> 00:40:17,750
List friends.

880
00:40:17,784 --> 00:40:19,220
Uh, next question.

881
00:40:20,454 --> 00:40:23,157
You know, I'm... I'm not
actually unpopular, you know.

882
00:40:23,190 --> 00:40:24,858
That would mean
they know I exist.

883
00:40:24,892 --> 00:40:26,560
- Perhaps you don't.
- Hey!

884
00:40:26,594 --> 00:40:28,229
List relations.

885
00:40:28,262 --> 00:40:31,599
Dad, Donka,
some Bulgarian uncles.

886
00:40:31,632 --> 00:40:34,001
Donka says, actually,
one was possessed,

887
00:40:34,034 --> 00:40:37,304
but I think it might
have been a nut allergy.

888
00:40:39,607 --> 00:40:41,575
There was Mom, too, of course.

889
00:40:41,609 --> 00:40:44,278
But, uh,
she died when I was two.

890
00:40:45,446 --> 00:40:48,515
And Dad moved us out here.

891
00:40:48,549 --> 00:40:53,587
It doesn't make me sad exactly
'cause I... I can't remember.

892
00:40:53,621 --> 00:40:57,057
But it did make
things hard for Dad.

893
00:40:57,091 --> 00:40:59,059
She was returned
to the facility?

894
00:40:59,093 --> 00:41:03,230
I guess. No receipt.

895
00:41:05,666 --> 00:41:08,202
Scratches neck
14.5 times a day.

896
00:41:08,235 --> 00:41:10,804
- What are you doing?
- I am learning about my friend.

897
00:41:10,838 --> 00:41:12,039
Oh, cool.

898
00:41:12,072 --> 00:41:14,475
Please slap my hand
to show we are bonding.

899
00:41:14,508 --> 00:41:16,543
Oh! Okay.

900
00:41:17,745 --> 00:41:18,946
You went to sleep!

901
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:21,682
No. It was a move.

902
00:41:21,715 --> 00:41:23,917
Am I now your best friend
out of the box?

903
00:41:23,951 --> 00:41:26,287
You're not still
after that sticker.

904
00:41:29,123 --> 00:41:31,358
Oh, no, Ron. I'm so sorry.
Hold on. Hold on.

905
00:41:31,392 --> 00:41:33,961
- Connect. Connect.
- No! Stop!

906
00:41:33,994 --> 00:41:37,765
- Oh, no! Not that one! Ron!
- Connect. Connect. Connect.

907
00:41:37,797 --> 00:41:40,434
That's Savannah's house!

908
00:41:40,467 --> 00:41:42,569
Okay, key light,
Malibu filter.

909
00:41:43,370 --> 00:41:44,571
- Perfect.
- Boom!

910
00:41:44,605 --> 00:41:46,006
Oh, hey, guys.

911
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:47,374
You just caught me chilling.

912
00:41:49,877 --> 00:41:52,613
Afloat. Aquatic.

913
00:41:52,646 --> 00:41:54,648
Accident.

914
00:41:57,918 --> 00:41:59,486
What is that?

915
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:02,790
It sounds like a giant snake.
Or an evil clown!

916
00:42:02,856 --> 00:42:03,857
They live in the woods,

917
00:42:03,891 --> 00:42:05,592
and their heads go
all the way around!

918
00:42:09,496 --> 00:42:10,964
- Evil clown! Evil clown!
- Sorry. I'm sorry.

919
00:42:10,998 --> 00:42:12,766
I'm just really wheezy, guys.
I've been running.

920
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,134
Ron!

921
00:42:16,437 --> 00:42:17,604
Barney Pudowski?

922
00:42:23,077 --> 00:42:25,112
You've ruined my aesthetic.

923
00:42:25,145 --> 00:42:28,782
- Sorry, Savannah.
- Nice pool.

924
00:42:28,817 --> 00:42:32,119
Wait. Since when
did you even have a B-Bot?

925
00:42:32,152 --> 00:42:34,722
And... Whoa. Look at him.

926
00:42:34,755 --> 00:42:36,957
I'm sorry. We're going
right now. I just...

927
00:42:39,226 --> 00:42:40,127
Uh...

928
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:42,629
Barney, your B-Bot is,
like, super weird.

929
00:42:42,663 --> 00:42:44,531
- Yeah.
- And naked?

930
00:42:44,565 --> 00:42:45,532
Ew!

931
00:42:45,566 --> 00:42:48,035
And hold on a sec.
Why hasn't it friended me?

932
00:42:48,068 --> 00:42:50,871
Would you like to friend
@theSavannahMeads?

933
00:42:50,904 --> 00:42:53,707
No. He can't do
any of that stuff.

934
00:42:53,741 --> 00:42:56,811
He can't make friends or...
He's useless at all that.

935
00:42:56,845 --> 00:42:59,780
- Can't make friends?
- What?

936
00:42:59,814 --> 00:43:01,682
Barney,
don't say your weirdness

937
00:43:01,715 --> 00:43:03,217
has rubbed off on him.

938
00:43:03,250 --> 00:43:05,586
Making friends is, like,
what he's for.

939
00:43:05,619 --> 00:43:09,223
If he can't do that, he's,
like, literally pointless.

940
00:43:09,256 --> 00:43:12,626
Like, a lump of plastic
just following you around.

941
00:43:12,659 --> 00:43:15,028
Hashtag landfill.

942
00:43:15,062 --> 00:43:16,997
- I am for making friends?
- Ron...

943
00:43:17,030 --> 00:43:18,833
How do I make friends
for Barney?

944
00:43:18,867 --> 00:43:20,401
Come.

945
00:43:20,434 --> 00:43:21,969
- Seriously?
- Ugh.

946
00:43:22,002 --> 00:43:24,371
You share stuff about him.

947
00:43:24,405 --> 00:43:27,674
Like pictures of his food
or his wake-up routine.

948
00:43:27,708 --> 00:43:29,009
You search
for people who know him

949
00:43:29,042 --> 00:43:30,845
or like the same stuff as him.

950
00:43:30,879 --> 00:43:33,280
You show them pictures,
and then you get comments,

951
00:43:33,313 --> 00:43:35,182
and then you get
people that like him,

952
00:43:35,215 --> 00:43:36,784
and then you get
friend invites.

953
00:43:36,818 --> 00:43:39,453
- Boom! Now he has friends.
- Duh!

954
00:43:39,486 --> 00:43:40,855
Ron! We have to go!

955
00:43:40,889 --> 00:43:42,723
Does Barney need friends?

956
00:43:42,756 --> 00:43:45,125
Well, yeah! Or, fun fact,

957
00:43:45,159 --> 00:43:47,628
he will not survive
middle school.

958
00:43:47,661 --> 00:43:49,229
Savannah,
please don't tell anyone.

959
00:43:49,263 --> 00:43:53,000
I'm not supposed to have him.
He has to be a secret.

960
00:44:15,289 --> 00:44:17,724
She's rewiring <i>los electricos.</i>

961
00:44:17,758 --> 00:44:19,626
Okay. Unicorn poo.

962
00:44:20,794 --> 00:44:22,095
It's great.

963
00:44:22,129 --> 00:44:24,899
You like it!
Well, shipping date, um...

964
00:44:24,933 --> 00:44:27,401
Ow! It shocked me!

965
00:44:37,711 --> 00:44:40,047
Mind if I leave it on?

966
00:44:43,383 --> 00:44:45,820
I am literally pointless.

967
00:44:45,854 --> 00:44:46,855
What?

968
00:44:46,888 --> 00:44:48,989
I cannot make friends for you.

969
00:44:49,022 --> 00:44:52,125
Yeah. Well...

970
00:44:52,159 --> 00:44:54,695
I'm not so great
at that either.

971
00:44:54,728 --> 00:44:58,867
You should see me
during recess. Oh, it sucks.

972
00:44:58,900 --> 00:45:01,034
I stand there every day,

973
00:45:01,068 --> 00:45:04,505
on my own,
on the edge of the yard,

974
00:45:04,538 --> 00:45:08,008
just hoping for a few people
to share a bench with.

975
00:45:08,041 --> 00:45:09,142
You know?

976
00:45:09,176 --> 00:45:12,279
But why would they?

977
00:45:12,312 --> 00:45:14,214
The last time any of them
came to my house,

978
00:45:14,248 --> 00:45:15,549
we set fire to them.

979
00:45:15,582 --> 00:45:17,784
Ow! Not again.

980
00:45:20,989 --> 00:45:23,490
I guess I'll just
sleep with it off.

981
00:45:24,558 --> 00:45:25,759
Good night, Ron.

982
00:45:48,081 --> 00:45:50,117
<i>They're psychos!</i>

983
00:45:51,585 --> 00:45:54,923
It is them! I'd recognize
those ears from space.

984
00:45:54,956 --> 00:45:58,759
Okay. Location. GPS.
Uh... Get up the grid.

985
00:45:58,792 --> 00:46:00,227
Where is it?

986
00:46:00,260 --> 00:46:02,629
Uh, it's not actually
on the network.

987
00:46:02,663 --> 00:46:04,765
That's impossible.
So, I don't believe you.

988
00:46:04,798 --> 00:46:06,433
We track every B-Bot.

989
00:46:06,466 --> 00:46:08,903
- Um, yeah, but...
- Then the kid.

990
00:46:08,937 --> 00:46:12,372
I want everything. Contacts,
shopping habits, shoe-size.

991
00:46:12,406 --> 00:46:14,441
You mean his private data?

992
00:46:14,474 --> 00:46:16,310
Sure.
Why else do we collect it?

993
00:46:16,343 --> 00:46:18,913
We've got nothing on him.
He hasn't friended anyone.

994
00:46:18,947 --> 00:46:21,315
He doesn't blog, post,
or share.

995
00:46:21,348 --> 00:46:22,316
Creepy.

996
00:46:22,349 --> 00:46:24,986
The video was posted
by @theSavannahMeads.

997
00:46:25,019 --> 00:46:27,220
Her whole life is online.

998
00:46:27,254 --> 00:46:29,756
Andrew. Is it true?
It's still out there?

999
00:46:29,790 --> 00:46:33,327
The store made an error.
They squished Sally Squirrel.

1000
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:34,829
<i>♪ Let's learn where we... ♪</i>

1001
00:46:34,862 --> 00:46:37,497
That's awesome!

1002
00:46:37,531 --> 00:46:39,934
What the heck
are you talking about?

1003
00:46:39,968 --> 00:46:42,703
I looked into it. And...

1004
00:46:44,638 --> 00:46:46,506
See? This is it!

1005
00:46:46,540 --> 00:46:49,010
It's what I imagined
when I was his age.

1006
00:46:49,043 --> 00:46:50,644
They're having fun!

1007
00:46:50,677 --> 00:46:52,379
Fun?

1008
00:46:52,412 --> 00:46:54,949
How... How can you
have fun offline?

1009
00:46:54,983 --> 00:46:56,483
It's against nature.

1010
00:46:56,516 --> 00:47:00,487
Andrew, I never programmed
B-Bots to laugh.

1011
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:03,657
I have to understand this.
Can we get a hold of it?

1012
00:47:04,257 --> 00:47:05,692
Ho-ho, we will.

1013
00:47:18,639 --> 00:47:21,708
My aerial?
No power in whole street?

1014
00:47:21,742 --> 00:47:23,777
No. No idea.

1015
00:47:31,919 --> 00:47:35,056
What? Ron, no!
You have to hide.

1016
00:47:35,089 --> 00:47:36,390
You're not ready.

1017
00:47:37,224 --> 00:47:40,260
I'm sorry.
I'll be back soon.

1018
00:47:56,476 --> 00:47:59,179
There are no friends
in the shed.

1019
00:48:00,380 --> 00:48:02,850
Hi! I am Barney's B-Bot.

1020
00:48:02,884 --> 00:48:04,718
I live in the shed.

1021
00:48:04,751 --> 00:48:06,253
I am for making friends.

1022
00:48:06,286 --> 00:48:07,521
Idiot!

1023
00:48:07,554 --> 00:48:11,191
I am sharing Barney's
breakfast. Do you like it?

1024
00:48:11,224 --> 00:48:13,627
How about you?

1025
00:48:15,529 --> 00:48:18,565
Would you like to comment
on this picture, old woman?

1026
00:48:18,598 --> 00:48:22,436
Barney likes rocks, asthma inhalers,
and his grandmother's food.

1027
00:48:22,469 --> 00:48:25,572
Will you come to my secret
shed and like him?

1028
00:48:28,176 --> 00:48:30,444
No. No, no. No.

1029
00:48:31,378 --> 00:48:34,514
Barney likes
rock hammers, too!

1030
00:48:34,548 --> 00:48:35,883
I'm gonna be late.

1031
00:48:35,917 --> 00:48:37,250
My pants are on backwards.

1032
00:48:37,284 --> 00:48:39,419
That was Barney's
wake-up routine!

1033
00:48:39,453 --> 00:48:40,988
- Okay.
- Friend request.

1034
00:48:41,022 --> 00:48:41,989
Friend request.

1035
00:48:54,501 --> 00:48:56,104
So a prime number

1036
00:48:56,137 --> 00:48:58,305
is a natural number
greater than one

1037
00:48:58,338 --> 00:49:00,108
that cannot be divided
by any number.

1038
00:49:00,141 --> 00:49:01,374
I know you're keen,

1039
00:49:01,408 --> 00:49:04,344
but it's not quite
recess yet, Barney.

1040
00:49:04,377 --> 00:49:07,781
Oh, my asthma.
I need my inhaler, ma'am.

1041
00:49:07,815 --> 00:49:09,549
Uh, I'll be one minute.

1042
00:49:15,388 --> 00:49:17,992
Ron! What are you doing here?

1043
00:49:18,025 --> 00:49:20,094
There are no
friends in the shed.

1044
00:49:20,128 --> 00:49:21,829
I am for making friends.

1045
00:49:21,863 --> 00:49:24,464
No! No, no, no. You have to go
before they come out for...

1046
00:49:26,633 --> 00:49:27,969
Recess.

1047
00:49:30,437 --> 00:49:32,339
You have
two new messages.

1048
00:49:32,372 --> 00:49:34,208
Only two?

1049
00:49:34,242 --> 00:49:36,043
Hey, Barn. You got a B-Bot?

1050
00:49:36,077 --> 00:49:37,644
- Um...
- Hey.

1051
00:49:39,013 --> 00:49:40,380
Awesome.

1052
00:49:40,413 --> 00:49:42,183
Huh. Well, that went well.

1053
00:49:42,216 --> 00:49:43,416
I thought so.

1054
00:49:44,684 --> 00:49:45,853
Okay.

1055
00:49:46,888 --> 00:49:48,388
Come on.

1056
00:49:48,421 --> 00:49:51,893
Wow, that's so minimalistic.
It's like a blank canvas.

1057
00:49:53,493 --> 00:49:54,996
Friend request.

1058
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,300
Recess.

1059
00:50:00,333 --> 00:50:02,435
Maybe it'll be okay.

1060
00:50:02,469 --> 00:50:03,938
Recess will not suck.

1061
00:50:03,971 --> 00:50:06,506
You will have friends
to sit with on a bench.

1062
00:50:06,540 --> 00:50:09,277
I don't know. Yeah. I guess.

1063
00:50:09,309 --> 00:50:10,544
You will.

1064
00:50:10,577 --> 00:50:12,880
- I have brought you some.
- What?

1065
00:50:12,914 --> 00:50:14,916
I am literally not landfill.

1066
00:50:16,050 --> 00:50:18,351
This is so crazy.

1067
00:50:20,654 --> 00:50:22,455
Ron! Wait!

1068
00:50:26,459 --> 00:50:28,262
You have five new friends.

1069
00:50:28,296 --> 00:50:29,729
I did a search for them.

1070
00:50:29,763 --> 00:50:33,034
Shayne likes low-priced alcohol
and conspiracy theories.

1071
00:50:33,067 --> 00:50:35,303
He believes there's
a secret lizard government

1072
00:50:35,335 --> 00:50:36,770
- beneath Switzerland.
- Shh.

1073
00:50:36,804 --> 00:50:38,705
He will friend you
if he can stay in the shed.

1074
00:50:38,738 --> 00:50:42,310
Barney! Bro!
Just for a year. Two max.

1075
00:50:42,342 --> 00:50:44,011
Are those your friends,
Barney?

1076
00:50:44,045 --> 00:50:45,046
Is this, like, a rave?

1077
00:50:45,079 --> 00:50:47,747
This friend shared
your breakfast and liked it.

1078
00:50:47,781 --> 00:50:48,715
Oh, yeah!

1079
00:50:48,748 --> 00:50:50,417
He gets hungry like you.

1080
00:50:50,450 --> 00:50:53,453
Your neighbor Mrs. Baxter's parrot
has one friend in common with you.

1081
00:50:53,486 --> 00:50:54,889
Your neighbor, Mrs. Baxter.

1082
00:50:54,922 --> 00:50:57,390
He commented on your photo.

1083
00:50:57,424 --> 00:51:00,460
He has done other things
on your photo, too.

1084
00:51:01,195 --> 00:51:02,562
Margaret will friend you

1085
00:51:02,596 --> 00:51:03,730
- and share her...
- No.

1086
00:51:03,763 --> 00:51:05,233
...purse, watch, anything

1087
00:51:05,266 --> 00:51:07,068
if I please,
please just let her go.

1088
00:51:07,101 --> 00:51:10,604
Now you have friends to
sit with on a bench at recess.

1089
00:51:10,637 --> 00:51:12,807
I'm so sorry.
You can't be here.

1090
00:51:13,740 --> 00:51:15,843
Barney, meet
friend number five.

1091
00:51:15,877 --> 00:51:18,813
This tiny bald man
likes your picture so much,

1092
00:51:18,846 --> 00:51:20,114
he is eating it.

1093
00:51:20,147 --> 00:51:23,416
There he is! Logan!

1094
00:51:23,450 --> 00:51:25,186
Friend request,
friend request.

1095
00:51:25,219 --> 00:51:27,355
- Ron?
- Ron, Ron, Ron.

1096
00:51:27,387 --> 00:51:30,657
- Yeah! Come on!
- Ron, Ron, Ron!

1097
00:51:30,690 --> 00:51:32,626
Savannah Meads' mom
didn't recognize the boy.

1098
00:51:32,659 --> 00:51:33,895
We're at her school now.

1099
00:51:33,928 --> 00:51:35,729
Okay, sure.

1100
00:51:35,762 --> 00:51:37,999
We keep this low-key,
people. Discreet.

1101
00:51:38,032 --> 00:51:39,599
Nice and quiet, okay?

1102
00:51:39,633 --> 00:51:42,003
- Love you guys!
- Ron, Ron, Ron.

1103
00:51:43,104 --> 00:51:45,273
Pudowski!

1104
00:51:45,306 --> 00:51:47,074
Yeah!

1105
00:51:47,108 --> 00:51:49,277
Sticking it to the man!

1106
00:51:49,310 --> 00:51:52,079
Principal's office. Now!

1107
00:51:54,614 --> 00:51:56,918
Hey, bros. Ho-ho-ho-ho.

1108
00:51:58,418 --> 00:52:00,487
Come on, Pudowski. Move it!

1109
00:52:02,189 --> 00:52:04,292
You're not new, are you?

1110
00:52:04,325 --> 00:52:06,193
You're that crazy broken dude
who punched me.

1111
00:52:06,227 --> 00:52:07,962
How'd you do that?

1112
00:52:07,995 --> 00:52:10,764
I have no mega safety controls
and stuff.

1113
00:52:10,797 --> 00:52:14,402
Safety settings, parental
controls, account limits, all off!

1114
00:52:14,434 --> 00:52:16,070
That's how come
he hit you, dude!

1115
00:52:16,103 --> 00:52:18,705
I want mine like that.
Then it can hit me, too!

1116
00:52:18,738 --> 00:52:20,440
I could get R-rated movies.

1117
00:52:20,473 --> 00:52:22,776
Copy him. Find that code.

1118
00:52:23,643 --> 00:52:24,979
Unlock.

1119
00:52:25,512 --> 00:52:26,546
Unlock.

1120
00:52:26,579 --> 00:52:28,382
He's gonna get
us a trillion views!

1121
00:52:29,649 --> 00:52:31,285
I don't like you.

1122
00:52:31,319 --> 00:52:32,719
I don't like you.

1123
00:52:40,995 --> 00:52:42,196
Hey, guys.

1124
00:52:42,229 --> 00:52:44,231
Savannah. What's going on?

1125
00:52:44,265 --> 00:52:45,933
It's Bubble!

1126
00:52:45,967 --> 00:52:49,502
My post is such a hit,
the whole company's following me.

1127
00:52:49,536 --> 00:52:50,670
What post?

1128
00:52:50,704 --> 00:52:52,406
Twenty thousand
friends love...

1129
00:52:54,607 --> 00:52:58,245
What? I said he
has to be a secret.

1130
00:52:58,279 --> 00:53:00,480
I know. But it went crazy!

1131
00:53:01,614 --> 00:53:03,717
You're such
an actual freak, Barney,

1132
00:53:03,750 --> 00:53:05,987
it's, like, almost cool.

1133
00:53:09,190 --> 00:53:11,292
Pudowski!

1134
00:53:11,325 --> 00:53:13,693
Pudowski! What is going on?

1135
00:53:14,462 --> 00:53:16,430
Nothing, Ms. Hartley.

1136
00:53:16,464 --> 00:53:17,898
You brought in a baby?

1137
00:53:17,932 --> 00:53:19,699
Artificially
sweetened beverages?

1138
00:53:19,733 --> 00:53:21,302
- A parrot.
- A parrot.

1139
00:53:21,335 --> 00:53:24,972
Where is the bot?

1140
00:53:26,407 --> 00:53:28,376
Call head office.

1141
00:53:28,409 --> 00:53:30,411
Get him, boys.

1142
00:53:31,544 --> 00:53:33,381
Unlock, unlock, unlock.

1143
00:53:33,414 --> 00:53:34,581
Get 'em!

1144
00:53:39,086 --> 00:53:40,321
- Unlock.
- Uh...

1145
00:53:40,354 --> 00:53:43,690
Okay. Buy 10,000 mechbucks.

1146
00:53:43,723 --> 00:53:46,559
Whoa! It works!
BubblePay has no limits!

1147
00:53:46,593 --> 00:53:48,528
Give me weapons.
Give me upgrades.

1148
00:53:48,561 --> 00:53:50,231
All upgrades unlocked.

1149
00:53:50,264 --> 00:53:51,899
Hey! Jerk of Thrones.

1150
00:53:51,932 --> 00:53:54,235
- What?
- Get them!

1151
00:53:54,268 --> 00:53:56,536
Hey! Those are our bots!

1152
00:53:56,569 --> 00:53:58,205
- Give them back!
- Whoa!

1153
00:53:58,239 --> 00:54:00,307
Levelling up!

1154
00:54:00,341 --> 00:54:02,143
- Whoa!
- My prank, Noah.

1155
00:54:02,176 --> 00:54:03,310
Thanks for the ride. Oh!

1156
00:54:03,344 --> 00:54:04,644
Rich, come back!

1157
00:54:04,677 --> 00:54:06,914
Yo, Sav. Who's lame now?

1158
00:54:06,947 --> 00:54:09,383
- Hey!
- Unlock.

1159
00:54:09,417 --> 00:54:10,451
Do you wanna connect

1160
00:54:10,484 --> 00:54:12,585
to all the users
of the Bubble network?

1161
00:54:12,619 --> 00:54:15,555
You can access them all?
Um, yeah!

1162
00:54:15,588 --> 00:54:18,492
Okay, hi, um,
everyone in the world.

1163
00:54:18,526 --> 00:54:20,593
This is @theSavannahMeads.

1164
00:54:20,627 --> 00:54:23,431
And this is
Nonsuch Middle School.

1165
00:54:25,232 --> 00:54:26,800
<i>Incoming!</i>

1166
00:54:28,302 --> 00:54:32,306
It's <i>Mad Max</i> meets
<i>Sesame Street</i> live streaming.

1167
00:54:32,339 --> 00:54:34,809
We think the safety controls
are off on all the bots.

1168
00:54:34,842 --> 00:54:36,676
Uh, let's send out a patch.

1169
00:54:36,709 --> 00:54:38,079
Yeah, we're on it!

1170
00:54:40,414 --> 00:54:42,450
That was awesome!

1171
00:54:42,483 --> 00:54:43,650
What the...?

1172
00:54:43,683 --> 00:54:45,419
You shall not pass.

1173
00:54:45,453 --> 00:54:47,154
Kiss my Sith Lord butt!

1174
00:54:47,188 --> 00:54:48,688
Rabbits, attack!

1175
00:54:48,721 --> 00:54:51,624
Destroy! Destroy! Destroy!

1176
00:54:54,361 --> 00:54:55,863
Book a party at a night club.

1177
00:54:55,896 --> 00:54:58,032
Invite everyone.
Except Savannah.

1178
00:54:58,065 --> 00:54:59,166
Everybody, stop!

1179
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:00,434
Hey, Rich!

1180
00:55:00,468 --> 00:55:02,769
- Whoo-hoo-hoo!
- Catch!

1181
00:55:03,471 --> 00:55:05,272
Whoo!

1182
00:55:05,306 --> 00:55:07,074
You got this on the live, bro?

1183
00:55:09,609 --> 00:55:11,078
For the views!

1184
00:55:11,112 --> 00:55:14,081
So it's basically kind of
the apocalypse, but fun!

1185
00:55:14,115 --> 00:55:16,150
Hey, cut it out, Sav.
This is my thing.

1186
00:55:16,183 --> 00:55:17,818
Sorry, Rich. I have...

1187
00:55:17,852 --> 00:55:20,121
Four million, four hundred
and thirty-two views.

1188
00:55:20,154 --> 00:55:22,789
<i>Oh, Australia's waking up.
G'day, guys.</i>

1189
00:55:22,823 --> 00:55:25,459
We're about to be shamed
by a whole other hemisphere.

1190
00:55:25,493 --> 00:55:26,994
<i>I'm @theSavannahMeads.</i>

1191
00:55:27,027 --> 00:55:29,897
<i>And this is a giant monkey...</i>

1192
00:55:29,930 --> 00:55:33,167
<i>zombie mash-up that's

1193
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:35,536
- Patch in one minute.
- Are you knitting this thing?

1194
00:55:35,569 --> 00:55:37,637
- Do something!
- Hello?

1195
00:55:37,670 --> 00:55:38,873
It's nearly pickup!

1196
00:55:39,639 --> 00:55:41,609
Brains!

1197
00:55:43,077 --> 00:55:46,147
<i>Ha-ha! And I'm Rich Belcher</i>

1198
00:55:46,180 --> 00:55:47,014

1199
00:55:47,047 --> 00:55:48,449
<i>Hey, hey.</i>

1200
00:55:48,482 --> 00:55:49,716
Snack!

1201
00:55:59,527 --> 00:56:01,629
It pooped me.

1202
00:56:01,661 --> 00:56:03,663
Sharing "It pooped me."

1203
00:56:03,696 --> 00:56:04,932
- Sharing "It pooped me."
- Sharing.

1204
00:56:04,965 --> 00:56:06,699
- No. Stop it.
- Sharing. Sharing. Sharing.

1205
00:56:06,733 --> 00:56:08,636
- Don't share that.
- Sharing "It pooped me."

1206
00:56:08,668 --> 00:56:09,970
Uploading the patch now!

1207
00:56:16,577 --> 00:56:17,744
That's the patch.

1208
00:56:17,777 --> 00:56:20,848
Just in time.
Good thing nobody saw it.

1209
00:56:21,916 --> 00:56:24,351
You just killed Bubble, Marc.

1210
00:56:24,385 --> 00:56:27,388
Spread out. Find the rogue.

1211
00:56:27,421 --> 00:56:31,258
How can I put this gently?
Get out!

1212
00:56:37,697 --> 00:56:39,500
Hi, Barney.

1213
00:56:39,533 --> 00:56:41,835
We have 43 new friends.

1214
00:56:41,869 --> 00:56:44,872
Maybe you do.
But I've been kicked out.

1215
00:56:46,340 --> 00:56:48,375
This way.

1216
00:56:48,409 --> 00:56:49,443
Ugh!

1217
00:57:06,694 --> 00:57:09,897
How could you? You dumb bot!

1218
00:57:10,698 --> 00:57:12,900
I'm in so much trouble now.

1219
00:57:12,933 --> 00:57:15,970
All you had to
do was just fit in.

1220
00:57:16,003 --> 00:57:17,571
What was the point of even...?

1221
00:57:17,605 --> 00:57:20,007
Barney,
are you my friend?

1222
00:57:20,040 --> 00:57:21,108
What?

1223
00:57:21,141 --> 00:57:22,309
What do you mean?

1224
00:57:22,343 --> 00:57:25,446
My dad bought you for me.

1225
00:57:26,347 --> 00:57:27,481
What's that?

1226
00:57:38,959 --> 00:57:40,060
Where are you going?

1227
00:57:40,094 --> 00:57:41,595
Friendship is
a two-way street.

1228
00:57:41,629 --> 00:57:42,863
- What?
- I get to choose.

1229
00:57:42,896 --> 00:57:44,198
You taught me.

1230
00:57:44,231 --> 00:57:46,267
I didn't say
be more than six feet.

1231
00:57:46,300 --> 00:57:48,135
But you are
having a bad day.

1232
00:57:48,168 --> 00:57:50,371
You know what? I don't care.
Fine! Go on then.

1233
00:57:50,404 --> 00:57:51,572
- I am going.
- Uh-huh.

1234
00:57:51,605 --> 00:57:53,274
- Okay.
- Okay. I'll...

1235
00:57:53,307 --> 00:57:54,575
- Okay.
- Okay!

1236
00:58:01,015 --> 00:58:03,250
<i>Adios,</i>
registered-name-Absalom.

1237
00:58:03,284 --> 00:58:05,486
<i>Adios,</i> Absalom's B-Bot.

1238
00:58:08,622 --> 00:58:10,224
It's trending
in 13 countries!

1239
00:58:10,257 --> 00:58:11,592
They've searched
the school, Marc.

1240
00:58:11,625 --> 00:58:12,792
They didn't find it.

1241
00:58:12,826 --> 00:58:14,561
Bubble shares
are crashing. Down 43%.

1242
00:58:14,595 --> 00:58:17,598
We've got thousands of parents
complaining about B-Bot safety.

1243
00:58:17,631 --> 00:58:21,368
We've got thousands of kids complaining
their bots won't do the same stuff!

1244
00:58:21,402 --> 00:58:23,837
Marc, what do we do?

1245
00:58:23,871 --> 00:58:26,807
I... Uh, I've...

1246
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:28,342
I wonder.

1247
00:58:30,644 --> 00:58:34,748
Maybe being a guy who makes
his friends out of skateboards

1248
00:58:34,782 --> 00:58:37,518
doesn't equip you to run
a global tech giant.

1249
00:58:37,551 --> 00:58:39,486
Mm!

1250
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:40,921
Okay. Here's our story.

1251
00:58:40,954 --> 00:58:42,289
We blame everything
on the rogue.

1252
00:58:42,323 --> 00:58:44,625
A single unit with
a minor coding error.

1253
00:58:44,658 --> 00:58:46,160
Minor? But the riot.

1254
00:58:46,193 --> 00:58:48,228
What riot?
We hose down the Internet.

1255
00:58:48,262 --> 00:58:50,064
Delete every video.
Take down every post.

1256
00:58:50,097 --> 00:58:51,398
Any TV station broadcasts it,

1257
00:58:51,432 --> 00:58:53,467
we buy the station and
replace it with cat videos,

1258
00:58:53,500 --> 00:58:55,269
then we sue the kids
for misuse of product

1259
00:58:55,302 --> 00:58:56,970
unless they sign
a binding yada, yada,

1260
00:58:57,004 --> 00:58:59,606
and send the principal
a fruit basket.

1261
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:01,842
But what does
the genius think?

1262
00:59:03,110 --> 00:59:07,348
Okay.
Andrew, you do this.

1263
00:59:07,381 --> 00:59:09,683
Sweet justice pie.

1264
00:59:09,717 --> 00:59:10,851
Hey, run off back to your lab

1265
00:59:10,884 --> 00:59:12,553
and invent something
that doesn't kill us all.

1266
00:59:12,586 --> 00:59:15,956
And, uh, you got an algorithm
for refilling this?

1267
00:59:16,790 --> 00:59:18,525
We got an address
from the school.

1268
00:59:18,559 --> 00:59:20,561
Pudowski. Oak Hill Drive.

1269
00:59:20,594 --> 00:59:22,363
Bing bong belushi!

1270
00:59:22,396 --> 00:59:23,397
Go!

1271
00:59:28,268 --> 00:59:30,471
Huh?

1272
00:59:30,504 --> 00:59:33,607
No. But Barney
doesn't even have a B-Bot.

1273
00:59:33,640 --> 00:59:36,777
All the kids at school
confirm he does, Mr. Pudowski.

1274
00:59:36,811 --> 00:59:38,045
He started a riot.

1275
00:59:38,078 --> 00:59:40,247
I'm sorry, are you calling
my son a liar?

1276
00:59:40,280 --> 00:59:42,449
Oh, Barney.

1277
00:59:55,763 --> 00:59:58,799
<i>Barney,
are you my friend?</i>

1278
01:00:02,136 --> 01:00:04,304
<i>"Know
everything about me."</i>

1279
01:00:06,206 --> 01:00:08,542
<i>"Stay within six feet of me."</i>

1280
01:00:10,744 --> 01:00:13,180
<i>"Like me."</i>

1281
01:00:17,084 --> 01:00:19,019
Huh?

1282
01:00:20,754 --> 01:00:22,656
Ron!

1283
01:00:23,858 --> 01:00:24,958
What are you doing?

1284
01:00:24,992 --> 01:00:27,628
Returning myself
to the facility.

1285
01:00:27,661 --> 01:00:28,962
I am a dumb bot.

1286
01:00:28,996 --> 01:00:32,966
No! No, you're not.
I'm so sorry.

1287
01:00:33,734 --> 01:00:35,769
I was wrong.

1288
01:00:35,803 --> 01:00:39,006
We did not fix me.
I did not fit in.

1289
01:00:39,039 --> 01:00:41,375
Who cares? Neither do I.

1290
01:00:41,408 --> 01:00:46,513
It doesn't matter.
'Cause you are my friend.

1291
01:00:51,084 --> 01:00:53,320
Your best friend
out of the box?

1292
01:01:22,149 --> 01:01:25,352
But still don't burn
my underpants.

1293
01:01:25,385 --> 01:01:28,121
You know, I have been
worried about him, but, uh,

1294
01:01:28,155 --> 01:01:29,990
I just... I work
these crazy hours.

1295
01:01:30,023 --> 01:01:31,225
The bot's in there?

1296
01:01:31,258 --> 01:01:32,927
Okay. This thing is dangerous.

1297
01:01:32,961 --> 01:01:34,695
We need to destroy it.

1298
01:01:36,965 --> 01:01:38,232
- Let's run.
- Barney,

1299
01:01:38,265 --> 01:01:39,968
are you in there?

1300
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:41,836
Just you and me.

1301
01:01:41,870 --> 01:01:43,036
Mom,
do you have a key?

1302
01:01:43,070 --> 01:01:44,338
We don't need anyone else.

1303
01:01:44,371 --> 01:01:48,175
Hey, you're not in trouble.
Please, just let me in.

1304
01:01:50,945 --> 01:01:52,145
Where is he?

1305
01:01:54,581 --> 01:01:55,817
- Shh.
- No clucking.

1306
01:01:55,850 --> 01:01:57,217
Could he
be with a friend?

1307
01:01:57,251 --> 01:02:00,721
Well, he...
he doesn't really have any.

1308
01:02:12,132 --> 01:02:13,767
Hey! Isn't that the kid?

1309
01:02:13,800 --> 01:02:16,136
Go! Go, go, go!

1310
01:02:16,169 --> 01:02:18,138
He's getting away!

1311
01:02:18,171 --> 01:02:20,107
We need to go faster!

1312
01:02:20,140 --> 01:02:21,575
No problem!

1313
01:02:25,312 --> 01:02:27,949
Ron, you did it! Yes!

1314
01:02:30,985 --> 01:02:32,820
Hey, down here!

1315
01:02:34,388 --> 01:02:37,491
Hey, stop! Come back!
We just want the bot!

1316
01:02:39,994 --> 01:02:41,428
Quick!

1317
01:02:43,564 --> 01:02:44,565
Shh.

1318
01:02:44,598 --> 01:02:48,036
"Poop Girl" is trending.
You have 19,032,000 likes.

1319
01:02:50,771 --> 01:02:52,272
- He went this way!
- Shh.

1320
01:02:52,306 --> 01:02:54,708
Hey, miss. You seen
a boy and a bot?

1321
01:02:56,677 --> 01:02:58,378
Do I look like I care?

1322
01:02:59,079 --> 01:03:01,582
Okay, sorry. My bad.

1323
01:03:01,615 --> 01:03:02,817
What's going on?

1324
01:03:02,850 --> 01:03:04,384
Bubble are looking for Ron.

1325
01:03:04,418 --> 01:03:06,520
They blame him for the riot.
I have to protect him.

1326
01:03:06,553 --> 01:03:08,856
Hey, dude.
I think that was Poop Girl.

1327
01:03:09,958 --> 01:03:12,192
Savannah?

1328
01:03:12,225 --> 01:03:14,394
"Poop Girl" has
20 million and 56...

1329
01:03:15,930 --> 01:03:18,365
Poop Girl. That's...

1330
01:03:18,398 --> 01:03:21,768
That's who I'm gonna be
for my whole life.

1331
01:03:21,802 --> 01:03:22,803
No.

1332
01:03:24,237 --> 01:03:25,305
You sure
he's not back there?

1333
01:03:25,339 --> 01:03:27,207
- We gotta go.
- Wait.

1334
01:03:27,240 --> 01:03:29,343
You're running away?
To the woods?

1335
01:03:29,376 --> 01:03:31,511
Please don't tell
anyone this time.

1336
01:03:31,545 --> 01:03:33,380
There are evil clowns
in there, Barney.

1337
01:03:33,413 --> 01:03:35,349
Their heads go
all the way around.

1338
01:03:35,382 --> 01:03:38,385
That's owls,
Savannah. I promise!

1339
01:03:43,223 --> 01:03:46,894
You lost them? No, no, no.
This is not happening.

1340
01:03:48,528 --> 01:03:49,463
You know what?

1341
01:03:49,496 --> 01:03:51,833
Access the cameras
on every B-Bot in town.

1342
01:03:51,866 --> 01:03:53,400
Use B-Bots to spy?

1343
01:03:53,433 --> 01:03:57,071
No. We're just recording for
training and monitoring purposes.

1344
01:03:57,105 --> 01:03:58,973
- But Marc would never...
- Marc put a camera

1345
01:03:59,007 --> 01:04:01,441
within six feet of every
young consumer in the country.

1346
01:04:01,475 --> 01:04:04,211
And now you're
worried about privacy?

1347
01:04:04,244 --> 01:04:05,512
Turn on the mics, too.

1348
01:04:05,545 --> 01:04:07,581
Listen out for
"Barney," "Rogue Bot,"

1349
01:04:07,614 --> 01:04:10,617
"Profit-sucking plastic
psycho." That kind of thing.

1350
01:04:10,651 --> 01:04:14,521
We'll find him. Wherever he is
in that Podunk town!

1351
01:04:17,357 --> 01:04:20,094
- Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
- Whoo-hoo.

1352
01:04:31,973 --> 01:04:33,875
Whoo!

1353
01:04:47,021 --> 01:04:49,322
Whoo.

1354
01:04:49,356 --> 01:04:51,324
- Ron.
- In your face.

1355
01:04:54,194 --> 01:04:56,898
Come on, Space Lord, fight me!

1356
01:04:56,931 --> 01:04:57,999
You need a stick.

1357
01:04:58,032 --> 01:05:00,034
- Searching for stick.
- Huh?

1358
01:05:00,068 --> 01:05:01,234
Is this one good?

1359
01:05:01,268 --> 01:05:02,569
Come back
and let me hurt you.

1360
01:05:02,602 --> 01:05:04,304
Ron! That's way too big
for a stick!

1361
01:05:04,337 --> 01:05:06,273
Look at mine compared
to yours!

1362
01:05:06,306 --> 01:05:08,142
Please help.

1363
01:05:08,176 --> 01:05:10,477
You have 0.85 friends.

1364
01:05:10,510 --> 01:05:12,814
- You have 0.7 friends.
- Oh, wow, you're sinking.

1365
01:05:12,847 --> 01:05:14,882
Hold on. Just...

1366
01:05:14,916 --> 01:05:16,349
You have 0.2 friends.

1367
01:05:16,383 --> 01:05:17,451
Grab my hands!
I'm gonna get you out.

1368
01:05:17,484 --> 01:05:19,053
I'm gonna get you out.

1369
01:05:25,258 --> 01:05:27,694
You know what? You choose.

1370
01:05:27,728 --> 01:05:29,864
Two-way street, right?

1371
01:05:29,897 --> 01:05:31,032
That way is good.

1372
01:05:31,065 --> 01:05:32,466
No, wait, wait.
Where are you going?

1373
01:05:33,266 --> 01:05:36,971
Ron. Hey, wait.
Stop! Stop, stop.

1374
01:05:39,006 --> 01:05:40,908
No! Ron!

1375
01:05:49,917 --> 01:05:51,451
Gotcha! Whoa!

1376
01:05:53,420 --> 01:05:55,622
Gotcha!

1377
01:05:59,227 --> 01:06:02,295
What? Why on earth
would you do that?

1378
01:06:02,329 --> 01:06:04,065
Do I have to like
the path you like?

1379
01:06:04,098 --> 01:06:07,235
No!
But your path sucks!

1380
01:06:07,267 --> 01:06:10,504
And seriously?
Off a cliff?

1381
01:06:10,537 --> 01:06:11,371
I like,

1382
01:06:11,404 --> 01:06:13,908
"Seriously?
Off a cliff?"

1383
01:06:13,941 --> 01:06:15,810
That way is good.

1384
01:06:15,843 --> 01:06:17,377
Log. Log.

1385
01:06:17,410 --> 01:06:18,880
- Log.
- Here.

1386
01:06:20,014 --> 01:06:21,816
Been eating
too much electricity?

1387
01:06:21,849 --> 01:06:25,153
- Your muscles are under-sized.
- No, they're not.

1388
01:06:28,823 --> 01:06:30,423
Hey, Ron.

1389
01:06:30,457 --> 01:06:34,561
Tell me something about you.
I never asked.

1390
01:06:34,594 --> 01:06:37,265
I am a Bubble
generation one B-Bot.

1391
01:06:37,297 --> 01:06:39,834
I currently have one friend.

1392
01:06:45,639 --> 01:06:48,843
- Oh, wow. I found it.
- Nice!

1393
01:06:49,709 --> 01:06:50,677
You wanna share?

1394
01:06:55,216 --> 01:06:58,585
You have not shared
29 friend invites.

1395
01:06:59,786 --> 01:07:01,688
Yeah. I know.

1396
01:07:03,090 --> 01:07:06,027
If you don't ask,
they can't say no.

1397
01:07:06,961 --> 01:07:08,361
Problem solved.

1398
01:07:12,799 --> 01:07:15,269
You know who I had at my party
when I was six?

1399
01:07:15,303 --> 01:07:18,638
Savannah and Rich. For real.

1400
01:07:18,672 --> 01:07:21,909
They were my friends just
because they lived nearby.

1401
01:07:21,943 --> 01:07:27,514
But at some point you just...
You just get it...

1402
01:07:27,547 --> 01:07:29,416
that you're not gonna be
one of the cool kids.

1403
01:07:32,920 --> 01:07:34,588
Hey, who cares, right?

1404
01:07:34,621 --> 01:07:37,892
'Cause I currently have
one friend, too.

1405
01:07:38,893 --> 01:07:41,062
How long will we
live in the woods?

1406
01:07:41,095 --> 01:07:42,897
I don't know.

1407
01:07:46,600 --> 01:07:47,869
Forever?

1408
01:07:55,977 --> 01:07:57,777
Do you know any stories, Ron?

1409
01:07:57,812 --> 01:08:00,882
I can create one
from my available data.

1410
01:08:00,915 --> 01:08:01,983
It will be called

1411
01:08:02,016 --> 01:08:04,484
"The Awesome Adventures
of Absalom of Addis Ababa

1412
01:08:04,517 --> 01:08:06,786
"and His Android, Alan."

1413
01:08:08,289 --> 01:08:10,790
Once upon a time
in Addis Ababa,

1414
01:08:10,825 --> 01:08:13,627
capital city of Ethiopia,
sovereign state in the Horn of Africa,

1415
01:08:13,660 --> 01:08:15,162
with 100 million inhabitants,

1416
01:08:15,196 --> 01:08:20,634
lived Absalom and his friend
Alan, a generation one android.

1417
01:08:20,667 --> 01:08:22,636
That's a nice story.

1418
01:08:34,916 --> 01:08:36,884
<i>Shall we check your

1419
01:08:36,918 --> 01:08:38,652
- <i>Yeah, sure.</i>
- <i>"Poop Girl" is trending.</i>

1420
01:08:38,685 --> 01:08:40,321
<i>Savannah
unfriended me? Unfriend her!</i>

1421
01:08:40,354 --> 01:08:42,722

1425
01:08:48,262 --> 01:08:49,964
My algorithm. What?

1426
01:08:52,599 --> 01:08:53,667
<i>Did you see Savannah?</i>

1427
01:08:53,700 --> 01:08:54,902
<i>Poop Girl, right?</i>

1428
01:08:54,936 --> 01:08:56,170
<i>I'm so glad
I am not her right now.</i>

1429
01:08:56,203 --> 01:08:57,504
<i>You dropped her
from this chat, right?</i>

1430
01:08:57,537 --> 01:08:58,438
<i>Dropping Savannah

<i>♪ It pooped me ♪</i>

1434
01:09:04,011 --> 01:09:06,113
Who did that?

1435
01:09:06,147 --> 01:09:07,480
Anonymouse3 created it.

1436
01:09:07,514 --> 01:09:11,085
23 million friends love
"Poop Girl, the Remix!"

1437
01:09:15,022 --> 01:09:16,057
Oh.

1438
01:09:16,090 --> 01:09:18,558
Hi. Uh, we're Barney's...

1439
01:09:19,093 --> 01:09:20,094
Um...

1440
01:09:20,794 --> 01:09:23,264
He hasn't come home.

1441
01:09:23,297 --> 01:09:26,000
And, yeah. So we're just...

1442
01:09:26,033 --> 01:09:28,235
We're checking with his, uh...

1443
01:09:28,269 --> 01:09:29,602
his fellow children.

1444
01:09:29,636 --> 01:09:31,439
You are Barney's friend.

1445
01:09:31,471 --> 01:09:33,074
You come to his
birthday party.

1446
01:09:33,107 --> 01:09:33,941
Um...

1447
01:09:33,975 --> 01:09:36,010
My goat eat
your slap bracelet.

1448
01:09:36,043 --> 01:09:37,878
Oh! That party.

1449
01:09:37,912 --> 01:09:41,115
Do you have any idea
where he is?

1450
01:09:41,481 --> 01:09:42,549
Uh... Um...

1451
01:09:42,582 --> 01:09:45,685
No, I, uh... Sorry.

1452
01:09:50,657 --> 01:09:55,396
Oh, Mom. I work round
the clock selling novelty junk

1453
01:09:55,429 --> 01:09:57,865
just to try to
give him a life.

1454
01:09:57,898 --> 01:10:02,103
But I'm blowing it, Mom.
I... I've lost touch with him.

1455
01:10:02,136 --> 01:10:03,603
Why didn't he come to me?

1456
01:10:03,636 --> 01:10:07,008
Sometimes kid
protect grown-up.

1457
01:10:07,041 --> 01:10:08,142
That's not right.

1458
01:10:08,175 --> 01:10:09,509
He will be okay.

1459
01:10:09,542 --> 01:10:12,947
Pudowskis are
brave and strong.

1460
01:10:22,490 --> 01:10:25,860
There's a spider.
Literally, like, this big!

1461
01:10:25,893 --> 01:10:27,928
A bird has commented
on your face.

1462
01:10:29,463 --> 01:10:31,132
Oh, great.

1463
01:10:33,733 --> 01:10:35,836
Where even are we?

1464
01:10:40,107 --> 01:10:43,676
Recess. Now known as
20 minutes of extra math.

1465
01:10:43,710 --> 01:10:45,012
What is
four-fifths as a decimal?

1466
01:10:45,046 --> 01:10:46,514
What is the
square root of nine?

1467
01:10:46,546 --> 01:10:47,614
Ugh! Seriously?

1468
01:10:47,647 --> 01:10:49,083
You have to be kidding me.

1469
01:10:49,116 --> 01:10:50,617
Alex, Jayden!

1470
01:10:50,650 --> 01:10:52,752
Yesterday was sick, right?

1471
01:10:52,786 --> 01:10:55,555
Sorry. Jayden's not
available right now.

1472
01:10:55,588 --> 01:10:57,525
They've blocked me?

1473
01:10:57,557 --> 01:10:58,658
Simplify the expression:

1474
01:10:58,691 --> 01:11:01,328
three to the power
of eight minus eleven.

1475
01:11:03,464 --> 01:11:04,532
Rich!

1476
01:11:04,564 --> 01:11:05,565
Twenty-five million
friends love...

1477
01:11:05,598 --> 01:11:09,170
- <i>♪ It pooped me ♪</i>
- Wait! Seriously!

1478
01:11:09,203 --> 01:11:11,906
- You have ruined my life.
- Uh...

1479
01:11:11,939 --> 01:11:15,943
But, look. It's Barney, okay?
He's missing.

1480
01:11:15,976 --> 01:11:16,811
What?

1481
01:11:16,844 --> 01:11:18,979
You and me,
we got him in trouble.

1482
01:11:19,013 --> 01:11:22,483
He's in the woods.
It's our fault he's out there.

1483
01:11:32,426 --> 01:11:33,793
Access denied.

1484
01:11:33,828 --> 01:11:36,796
- Here.
- Access denied. Access...

1485
01:11:38,399 --> 01:11:39,934
Access.

1486
01:11:41,368 --> 01:11:43,170
Let's find some place to camp.

1487
01:11:50,710 --> 01:11:52,580
Everything's wet.

1488
01:11:52,612 --> 01:11:53,746
How long is...

1489
01:11:53,780 --> 01:11:55,015
"I don't know. Forever"?

1490
01:11:55,049 --> 01:11:57,551
Twelve hours?
Twelve days? Twelve years?

1491
01:11:57,585 --> 01:11:59,587
- Twelve decades?
- Stop asking dumb questions.

1492
01:11:59,619 --> 01:12:02,189
I have 12% battery
power remaining.

1493
01:12:02,223 --> 01:12:04,158
Ron, come back.

1494
01:12:04,191 --> 01:12:05,725
Have you got water damage
to the brain?

1495
01:12:05,758 --> 01:12:06,994
I mean, seriously?

1496
01:12:07,027 --> 01:12:10,064
If you go back, they will
send you to the crusher.

1497
01:12:10,097 --> 01:12:12,632
Do you want to be recycled
as a lunch box?

1498
01:12:12,665 --> 01:12:14,602
What is your plan? Is it,

1499
01:12:14,634 --> 01:12:16,036
"Run! Run away!

1500
01:12:16,070 --> 01:12:18,105
- "Go, go, go! We gotta run."
- Stop. Ron.

1501
01:12:18,139 --> 01:12:19,006
Stop it!

1502
01:12:19,039 --> 01:12:21,142
Avoids problems
89% of the time.

1503
01:12:21,175 --> 01:12:22,543
You are so annoying!

1504
01:12:22,576 --> 01:12:25,846
You are so annoying
43.8% of the time.

1505
01:12:27,348 --> 01:12:29,984
Why don't you save your
battery by getting off my back?

1506
01:12:32,386 --> 01:12:35,089
Argh. There's nothing
in these woods that'll burn!

1507
01:12:37,191 --> 01:12:38,325
Incorrect.

1508
01:12:42,463 --> 01:12:44,398
Ha-ha-ha-ha.

1509
01:12:53,240 --> 01:12:54,674
What's that?

1510
01:12:54,707 --> 01:12:55,910
I never told you that.

1511
01:12:55,943 --> 01:12:57,511
I'm not afraid of the dark.

1512
01:13:00,214 --> 01:13:01,615
Oh, no. Ron.

1513
01:13:01,649 --> 01:13:02,950
My solar battery function

1514
01:13:02,983 --> 01:13:04,885
has not been uploaded.

1515
01:13:05,853 --> 01:13:08,923
Electricity.
Of course you like it.

1516
01:13:08,956 --> 01:13:10,723
Five percent
battery remaining.

1517
01:13:10,757 --> 01:13:12,560
Five percent? Uh...

1518
01:13:12,593 --> 01:13:15,062
Okay. Go to sleep.
Power down. Power down.

1519
01:13:24,505 --> 01:13:27,408
Oh, Ron.
You're right about the dark.

1520
01:13:29,343 --> 01:13:33,746
After my mom died, I was
terrified every single night.

1521
01:13:34,415 --> 01:13:35,583
And I wanted so bad

1522
01:13:35,616 --> 01:13:38,152
to just run into my dad's room
and tell him...

1523
01:13:39,987 --> 01:13:41,754
but what if
he was scared, too?

1524
01:13:44,024 --> 01:13:45,025
Ron!

1525
01:13:45,792 --> 01:13:47,228
Seriously, Ron?

1526
01:13:51,899 --> 01:13:54,201
No one even knows we're here.

1527
01:13:58,372 --> 01:14:01,976
<i>He's in the woods.
It's our fault he's out there.</i>

1528
01:14:02,009 --> 01:14:04,144
He left town for the woods?

1529
01:14:04,178 --> 01:14:06,680
It's night.
The weather's getting worse.

1530
01:14:06,714 --> 01:14:10,317
Pff. So access
the security cameras.

1531
01:14:10,718 --> 01:14:11,719
Uh...

1532
01:14:11,751 --> 01:14:14,588
There aren't any.
It's the woods.

1533
01:14:14,622 --> 01:14:17,124
Insane. Okay.

1534
01:14:19,326 --> 01:14:21,195
Let's put some in.

1535
01:14:28,768 --> 01:14:30,304
Get me to Nonsuch.

1536
01:14:30,337 --> 01:14:33,340
They're in the woods.
I have to meet Ron and Barney.

1537
01:14:48,355 --> 01:14:52,226
One of these trees must have a
power outlet or something, right?

1538
01:14:52,259 --> 01:14:55,095
Oh, this is not okay, Ron.

1539
01:14:55,129 --> 01:14:57,331
Best friends don't die
on each other.

1540
01:14:59,533 --> 01:15:01,368
Are we going
around in circles?

1541
01:15:05,239 --> 01:15:09,176
Hey! Down here! Over here!
Help us! Help!

1542
01:15:10,711 --> 01:15:13,280
Wait. They'll help me, but...

1543
01:15:16,116 --> 01:15:18,319
No, no, no. Come on.

1544
01:15:38,372 --> 01:15:39,440
What are they?

1545
01:15:44,978 --> 01:15:46,880
Ow.

1546
01:15:56,390 --> 01:15:57,558
I got nothing.

1547
01:15:57,591 --> 01:15:58,892
We can't give up.

1548
01:15:58,926 --> 01:16:01,662
People get lost in those woods
and never come out.

1549
01:16:11,672 --> 01:16:13,273
You know what?

1550
01:16:13,307 --> 01:16:16,076
We've done our best.
Let's call it a night.

1551
01:16:16,110 --> 01:16:17,812
- What? We can't do that.
- But what about the boy?

1552
01:16:17,846 --> 01:16:19,613
He's just not in there.

1553
01:16:19,646 --> 01:16:22,583
We should try across
town tomorrow.

1554
01:16:22,616 --> 01:16:23,650
Let's all go home.

1555
01:16:38,132 --> 01:16:41,535
That's Savannah's
B-Bot. And Noah's.

1556
01:16:47,508 --> 01:16:49,510
Ron.

1557
01:16:55,048 --> 01:16:57,785
I guess we're
both literally landfill.

1558
01:17:19,206 --> 01:17:21,241
"Poop Girl" has 32 million...

1559
01:17:21,275 --> 01:17:23,510
Why is there mud
on your wheels?

1560
01:17:26,213 --> 01:17:27,181
Huh?

1561
01:17:37,826 --> 01:17:40,661
No, no. You can't go back.

1562
01:17:42,196 --> 01:17:44,698
Must survive middle school.

1563
01:17:44,731 --> 01:17:46,700
No, no, Ron.
They'll...

1564
01:17:46,733 --> 01:17:48,569
They'll take you forever.

1565
01:17:49,871 --> 01:17:52,339
They'll send
you to the crusher.

1566
01:17:53,574 --> 01:17:54,809
Stay with me.

1567
01:17:54,843 --> 01:17:58,545
There are no
friends in the woods.

1568
01:17:58,579 --> 01:17:59,646
Ron.

1569
01:18:00,681 --> 01:18:01,682
What is it?

1570
01:18:01,715 --> 01:18:02,983
Alert Bubble.
Alert Bubble. Alert Bubble.

1571
01:18:03,016 --> 01:18:04,051
Do you see that?
Oh, my gosh!

1572
01:18:04,084 --> 01:18:05,085
Bubble Bot,
Ron Bintscatsco...

1573
01:18:05,118 --> 01:18:06,253
- It's Ron.
- Hey! It's him!

1574
01:18:06,286 --> 01:18:08,021
- And... And Barney!
- Barney?

1575
01:18:09,089 --> 01:18:10,991
Barney! Come on!

1576
01:18:11,024 --> 01:18:12,861
We're coming, brother.
Hang on there!

1577
01:18:12,894 --> 01:18:14,194
- Barney, are you okay?
- Barney!

1578
01:18:14,228 --> 01:18:15,496
It's his asthma.
He can't breathe right.

1579
01:18:15,529 --> 01:18:17,832
Twelve-year-old boy.
Grade two bronchospasm.

1580
01:18:19,333 --> 01:18:21,335
Why are you guys here?

1581
01:18:21,368 --> 01:18:24,104
- Friends...
- Sixth birthday.

1582
01:18:24,137 --> 01:18:25,807
Sorry.

1583
01:18:25,840 --> 01:18:27,876
He thought that...
I... I know...

1584
01:18:29,142 --> 01:18:31,178
I know you're not my friends.

1585
01:18:33,146 --> 01:18:37,117
Well, we're not
not your friends.

1586
01:18:43,790 --> 01:18:44,859
Over here!

1587
01:18:44,893 --> 01:18:46,059
Yo, guys,
he's over here.

1588
01:18:46,093 --> 01:18:47,294
Get down here. Let's go!

1589
01:18:47,327 --> 01:18:48,562
He's hurt.
He needs help.

1590
01:18:48,595 --> 01:18:50,597
- Quick! It's them. Help them!
- Okay, I can see them.

1591
01:18:50,631 --> 01:18:51,765
Barney! Oh, Barney!

1592
01:18:51,798 --> 01:18:53,166
Mr. Pudowski,
Mr. Pudowski, he's over here.

1593
01:18:53,200 --> 01:18:54,801
Check his lungs
for a pulse or something.

1594
01:18:54,836 --> 01:18:56,236
- Stand back!
- Oh, my Barney.

1595
01:18:56,270 --> 01:18:57,337
All right, deep breaths.

1596
01:18:57,371 --> 01:18:58,739
Everything's okay.
Dad's here.

1597
01:18:58,772 --> 01:18:59,773
Help him, please!

1598
01:18:59,807 --> 01:19:00,909
We've located the kid.

1599
01:19:00,942 --> 01:19:02,175
It's them! They're safe.

1600
01:19:02,209 --> 01:19:04,478
They found them!

1601
01:19:04,511 --> 01:19:07,114
- What's happening?
- The bot saved the boy.

1602
01:19:07,147 --> 01:19:10,885
What? That evil
profit-sucking thing!

1603
01:19:10,919 --> 01:19:12,185
- Grab it!
- <i>I'm on it.</i>

1604
01:19:12,219 --> 01:19:13,353
- <i>Stand back.</i>
- <i>Hey... Let me take him.</i>

1605
01:19:13,387 --> 01:19:14,555
- Give me the bot.
- What are you doing?

1606
01:19:14,588 --> 01:19:15,756
- Stop! You can't take him!
- Leave him alone!

1607
01:19:15,789 --> 01:19:16,790
- Stop it!
- It's dangerous.

1608
01:19:16,824 --> 01:19:17,926
- He's not dangerous.
- No!

1609
01:19:17,959 --> 01:19:19,426
You can't take him.
We won't let you!

1610
01:19:19,459 --> 01:19:21,295
That bot is Barney's
best friend, dude.

1611
01:19:21,328 --> 01:19:24,064
He just saved his life!

1612
01:19:27,334 --> 01:19:29,169
- Oh, no.
- The stream's trending.

1613
01:19:29,202 --> 01:19:31,405
People are calling
the bot a hero!

1614
01:19:33,507 --> 01:19:34,508
Aw!

1615
01:19:34,541 --> 01:19:40,048
Brave Bubble Bot saved boy.
RIP, Ron. How sad.

1616
01:19:40,080 --> 01:19:42,649
- And yet how great for sales!
- What?

1617
01:19:42,683 --> 01:19:45,452
Okay. Moving on!

1618
01:19:55,495 --> 01:19:58,231
We've known Barney
since we were little.

1619
01:19:58,265 --> 01:20:01,702
You were his best friend
in kindergarten.

1620
01:20:01,735 --> 01:20:03,537
And you were mine.

1621
01:20:04,671 --> 01:20:06,273
It gets complicated.

1622
01:20:06,306 --> 01:20:08,508
Yeah, right.
Should I friend Barney?

1623
01:20:08,542 --> 01:20:10,812
Searching for
"Barney likes pranks."

1624
01:20:10,845 --> 01:20:12,080
No matches.

1625
01:20:12,112 --> 01:20:13,213
Your pranks are lame.

1626
01:20:13,246 --> 01:20:14,414
They're funny, man.

1627
01:20:14,448 --> 01:20:17,852
If I don't do funny,
uh, I got nothing.

1628
01:20:17,885 --> 01:20:20,253
Since when did
this stuff matter?

1629
01:20:20,287 --> 01:20:25,225
Barney and Ron.
It's like we used to be.

1630
01:20:25,258 --> 01:20:27,761
<i>♪ It pooped me ♪</i>

1631
01:20:34,002 --> 01:20:35,168
- Barney? Barney!
- Oh, Barney!

1632
01:20:35,202 --> 01:20:39,606
Hey! Oh, Barney,
I am so sorry.

1633
01:20:39,640 --> 01:20:40,842
I let you down.

1634
01:20:41,943 --> 01:20:44,544
I know I'm always
overwhelmed with work.

1635
01:20:44,578 --> 01:20:47,247
But I'm your dad, okay?

1636
01:20:47,280 --> 01:20:49,117
You're like a
piece of my heart

1637
01:20:49,149 --> 01:20:50,818
walking around the world,

1638
01:20:50,852 --> 01:20:53,420
and I love you so much

1639
01:20:53,453 --> 01:20:56,657
that it makes me strong enough
to deal with anything.

1640
01:20:57,424 --> 01:20:59,159
Except losing touch with you.

1641
01:21:00,360 --> 01:21:01,428
Just talk to me, Barney.

1642
01:21:01,461 --> 01:21:03,430
- I'm trying!
- You're lonely? I get it.

1643
01:21:03,463 --> 01:21:05,298
- Where's Ron?
- Just communicate.

1644
01:21:05,332 --> 01:21:06,968
Ow! Hey!

1645
01:21:07,001 --> 01:21:08,368
I've got a friend, Dad!

1646
01:21:08,402 --> 01:21:10,905
The one that saved
my life, remember?

1647
01:21:10,938 --> 01:21:12,639
- Where is he?
- Uh...

1648
01:21:12,673 --> 01:21:15,308
Hi. I'm Marc Wydell
from Bubble.

1649
01:21:15,342 --> 01:21:17,111
Where is Ron?
If you crushed him...

1650
01:21:17,145 --> 01:21:20,213
No, of course not.
Barney, I invented B-Bots.

1651
01:21:20,247 --> 01:21:23,250
They're my dream.
Connection and friendship.

1652
01:21:23,283 --> 01:21:26,420
But it's not working.

1653
01:21:26,453 --> 01:21:29,456
Except you and Ron.
I fixed him.

1654
01:21:29,489 --> 01:21:31,725
- I wanna understand.
- What's up, Barney?

1655
01:21:31,758 --> 01:21:33,193
Ron! You're okay!

1656
01:21:33,226 --> 01:21:34,795
What's that?

1657
01:21:34,829 --> 01:21:37,065
The new number one
on the high-five charts.

1658
01:21:37,098 --> 01:21:38,565
I now know all 100.

1659
01:21:38,598 --> 01:21:40,801
- Are you okay?
- Doing great, buddy!

1660
01:21:40,835 --> 01:21:44,038
Let's go home and check out
your awesome rock collection.

1661
01:21:44,072 --> 01:21:45,873
No. You like electricity.

1662
01:21:45,907 --> 01:21:47,207
I do if you do.

1663
01:21:47,240 --> 01:21:49,776
Wait. This isn't Ron.
What did you do to him?

1664
01:21:49,811 --> 01:21:51,445
His code was unstable.

1665
01:21:51,478 --> 01:21:53,181
So I re-installed
the algorithm...

1666
01:21:53,213 --> 01:21:54,748
He fixed me. Selfie?

1667
01:21:55,817 --> 01:21:57,384
- Old women. Not trending.
- Bah.

1668
01:21:57,417 --> 01:21:58,920
Widowed dads, downer!

1669
01:21:58,953 --> 01:22:01,354
- Hey.
- Enhance and post!

1670
01:22:01,388 --> 01:22:03,356
Un-fix him. It's not him!

1671
01:22:03,390 --> 01:22:05,225
N... No. It... It's okay.

1672
01:22:05,258 --> 01:22:06,593
I backed up Ron to the cloud.

1673
01:22:06,626 --> 01:22:10,198
I'll just log in and I'll find
the old... Huh?

1674
01:22:10,230 --> 01:22:13,233
They can't lock me out.
I'm the CEO of Bubble.

1675
01:22:13,266 --> 01:22:15,136
<i>As the new CEO of Bubble,</i>

1676
01:22:15,169 --> 01:22:16,904
<i>it's my sad duty to announce</i>

1677
01:22:16,938 --> 01:22:19,207
<i>that the shareholders
have wisely agreed</i>

1678
01:22:19,239 --> 01:22:20,842
<i>to fire Marc Wydell.</i>

1679
01:22:20,875 --> 01:22:24,045
Andrew! Andrew! Andrew!

1680
01:22:24,078 --> 01:22:25,113
- What?
- Argh.

1681
01:22:25,146 --> 01:22:26,279
Barney!

1682
01:22:26,313 --> 01:22:28,149
He's in the cloud.
That's what you said, right?

1683
01:22:28,182 --> 01:22:30,250
- Well...
- So take me there.

1684
01:22:30,283 --> 01:22:31,585
- I'm sorry?
- You heard my son.

1685
01:22:31,618 --> 01:22:34,222
He needs to get
to the cloud thing.

1686
01:22:34,254 --> 01:22:36,456
And I'm going with him! Uh...

1687
01:22:36,490 --> 01:22:39,127
Barney, the cloud
is in a concrete fortress

1688
01:22:39,160 --> 01:22:40,627
half a mile below Bubble.

1689
01:22:40,660 --> 01:22:43,998
There are two million servers
with a zettabyte of data.

1690
01:22:44,031 --> 01:22:45,699
How would you find Ron?

1691
01:22:48,069 --> 01:22:50,238
He's my friend.

1692
01:22:50,270 --> 01:22:54,142
So take me there
and get me in!

1693
01:22:54,175 --> 01:22:55,442
Yeah! Go get

1694
01:22:55,475 --> 01:22:57,511
- that psycho robot, dude!
- Go! Go, Barney!

1695
01:22:57,544 --> 01:23:01,249
Okay, Bubble booble.
Let's go get Ron.

1696
01:23:06,419 --> 01:23:09,223
<i>Okay. To get Barney
down into the cloud,</i>

1697
01:23:09,257 --> 01:23:10,825
<i>we'll have to break
in past security</i>

1698
01:23:10,858 --> 01:23:13,828
<i>and get right to the
heart of Bubble HQ.</i>

1699
01:23:13,861 --> 01:23:15,662
<i>Tomorrow afternoon,
all the workers</i>

1700
01:23:15,695 --> 01:23:17,965
<i>will be watching Andrew
in the launchitorium.</i>

1701
01:23:17,999 --> 01:23:19,066
<i>That's our chance.</i>

1702
01:23:19,100 --> 01:23:21,334
<i>All staff
to the launchitorium.</i>

1703
01:23:21,368 --> 01:23:23,503
<i>All staff to the
launchitorium.</i>

1704
01:23:23,537 --> 01:23:27,208
<i>Please welcome
your new CEO, Andrew!</i>

1705
01:23:29,442 --> 01:23:31,344
Yes, yes, yes!

1706
01:23:31,378 --> 01:23:32,546
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

1707
01:23:32,579 --> 01:23:35,315
Yes! Ha-ha! Love it!

1708
01:23:40,054 --> 01:23:41,388
- Hi.
- Hi there!

1709
01:23:41,421 --> 01:23:42,689
How can Bubble help you?

1710
01:23:42,722 --> 01:23:45,358
- Cleaner!
- Uh, ma'am, you can't just...

1711
01:23:45,392 --> 01:23:46,626
- Sir?
- Ma'am?

1712
01:23:46,660 --> 01:23:48,296
Yeah. Can you
take a look at this, please?

1713
01:23:48,328 --> 01:23:49,729
It just keeps crashing on me.

1714
01:23:49,763 --> 01:23:52,766
And there's a smell of burning
when I hit the space bar.

1715
01:23:52,799 --> 01:23:56,204
Sir, this isn't a Bubble Store.
This is HQ.

1716
01:23:56,237 --> 01:23:57,571
Oh. Uh...

1717
01:23:57,604 --> 01:24:00,041
Oh! I just put Bubble
in my GPS.

1718
01:24:00,074 --> 01:24:02,375
I wondered why
it was a 19-hour drive.

1719
01:24:02,409 --> 01:24:04,178
Can you look at it anyway?

1720
01:24:05,345 --> 01:24:07,181
Oh, silly me.

1721
01:24:07,215 --> 01:24:08,615
Again, please.

1722
01:24:09,984 --> 01:24:11,418
Oh! Ooh.

1723
01:24:11,451 --> 01:24:14,021
Hang... Might be... Ooh.

1724
01:24:19,593 --> 01:24:21,394
Pat down?

1725
01:24:21,428 --> 01:24:24,298
So, workers, colleagues,
shareholders.

1726
01:24:24,332 --> 01:24:27,001
Hi, shareholders. Love ya.

1727
01:24:27,034 --> 01:24:31,105
Bubble's had a few
minor problems lately, right?

1728
01:24:32,139 --> 01:24:35,609
Oof! Yeah.
But here's the good news.

1729
01:24:35,642 --> 01:24:40,114
There's nothing wrong
with our B-Bots. It's kids.

1730
01:24:40,147 --> 01:24:41,715
Kids are the problem.

1731
01:24:41,748 --> 01:24:44,085
You give a child
an hour of screen time,

1732
01:24:44,118 --> 01:24:45,418
you get peace and quiet.

1733
01:24:45,452 --> 01:24:48,022
You have his friends around,
all hell breaks loose!

1734
01:24:48,055 --> 01:24:49,223
Am I right, kids?

1735
01:24:49,257 --> 01:24:50,892
Stick to your screens.

1736
01:24:50,925 --> 01:24:54,628
Today, your best friend
out of the box becomes...

1737
01:24:54,661 --> 01:24:57,430
<i>The only friend
you'll ever need!</i>

1738
01:24:57,464 --> 01:24:58,900
<i>Just log in, sir.</i>

1739
01:24:58,933 --> 01:24:59,934
Okay.

1740
01:25:04,604 --> 01:25:05,940
Huh?

1741
01:25:05,973 --> 01:25:08,541
See? That's what it did
at my house.

1742
01:25:09,844 --> 01:25:11,078
All good.

1743
01:25:11,112 --> 01:25:12,445
What happened?

1744
01:25:13,680 --> 01:25:15,515
Come on!

1745
01:25:20,054 --> 01:25:22,123
Okay. Everybody out.

1746
01:25:22,589 --> 01:25:24,125
This goats smells.

1747
01:25:24,158 --> 01:25:25,592
Okay. This way.

1748
01:25:28,296 --> 01:25:30,630
Server room.
Fingerprint recognition.

1749
01:25:30,664 --> 01:25:32,432
Uh...

1750
01:25:33,401 --> 01:25:34,601
I fix it.

1751
01:25:37,671 --> 01:25:40,207
Lights, sprinklers,
air-con, security doors.

1752
01:25:40,241 --> 01:25:41,775
Eat it all, Martina!

1753
01:25:42,742 --> 01:25:45,146
What? Uh...

1754
01:25:47,014 --> 01:25:48,448
What the...?

1755
01:25:52,452 --> 01:25:54,855
- Okay.
- You guys go that way.

1756
01:26:00,593 --> 01:26:02,997
Good to see you, buddy.

1757
01:26:03,030 --> 01:26:04,332
What is going on?

1758
01:26:04,365 --> 01:26:06,000
Uh, there's
a guy in reception.

1759
01:26:06,033 --> 01:26:08,768
- What?
- It's his laptop.

1760
01:26:08,802 --> 01:26:13,707
"Pudowski Novelty Exports"?
Pudowski! That kid!

1761
01:26:13,740 --> 01:26:16,077
Uh, Andrew.
He's in the building.

1762
01:26:16,110 --> 01:26:17,178
What?

1763
01:26:17,211 --> 01:26:19,380
Hey, yeah.
I think he went down that way.

1764
01:26:19,413 --> 01:26:20,780
Down here!

1765
01:26:21,748 --> 01:26:23,851
Huh?
They were right here.

1766
01:26:23,884 --> 01:26:25,685
That is weird.

1767
01:26:26,954 --> 01:26:27,955
Okay.

1768
01:26:27,989 --> 01:26:30,057
<i>Barney, slide along
to the central shaft.</i>

1769
01:26:30,091 --> 01:26:32,893
<i>The data cables inside
lead to down to the cloud.</i>

1770
01:26:32,927 --> 01:26:35,528
<i>We'll cover security
and, uh, stuff.</i>

1771
01:26:35,562 --> 01:26:37,832
- Good luck, Momscke.
- Okay.

1772
01:26:42,837 --> 01:26:43,871
Okay.

1773
01:26:45,772 --> 01:26:47,707
Of course
they're in the corridors.

1774
01:26:47,741 --> 01:26:49,844
They didn't just vanish!

1775
01:26:52,579 --> 01:26:54,115
Just go down here.

1776
01:26:57,418 --> 01:26:58,651
Whoa.

1777
01:26:59,120 --> 01:27:00,287
Okay.

1778
01:27:12,665 --> 01:27:14,235
He never mentioned that.

1779
01:27:16,470 --> 01:27:18,105
What are you doing?

1780
01:27:18,139 --> 01:27:19,539
Uh... Uh...

1781
01:27:20,307 --> 01:27:21,442
Uh...

1782
01:27:21,475 --> 01:27:25,179
I... You have problem
with women in workplace?

1783
01:27:25,212 --> 01:27:26,247
I never said that.

1784
01:27:26,280 --> 01:27:27,415
You want to squeeze my knee?

1785
01:27:27,448 --> 01:27:28,615
What?

1786
01:27:28,648 --> 01:27:31,718
Andrew, we found this goat
in the electrics.

1787
01:27:31,751 --> 01:27:34,355
Who are you people?
An improv troupe?

1788
01:28:06,320 --> 01:28:07,720
Ron!

1789
01:28:09,890 --> 01:28:10,891
Ron!

1790
01:28:12,560 --> 01:28:15,262
Where is your
snotty little brat?

1791
01:28:15,296 --> 01:28:16,864
He's looking for his friend.

1792
01:28:16,897 --> 01:28:19,467
Friend? Friend?

1793
01:28:19,500 --> 01:28:21,801
Hey, are you my friend?

1794
01:28:23,471 --> 01:28:24,538
Sure, Andrew.

1795
01:28:24,572 --> 01:28:26,807
They're just code. A trick.

1796
01:28:26,841 --> 01:28:27,674
What?

1797
01:28:27,707 --> 01:28:29,676
Data-harvesting
units controlled by us.

1798
01:28:29,709 --> 01:28:31,611
Designed to give kids
a consumer experience

1799
01:28:31,644 --> 01:28:35,049
featuring products and services
tailored to their browsing profile.

1800
01:28:35,082 --> 01:28:37,617
The B-Bots know
everything about them.

1801
01:28:37,650 --> 01:28:40,221
So we can sell them stuff.

1802
01:28:40,254 --> 01:28:42,056
You're spying on kids?

1803
01:28:42,089 --> 01:28:43,824
I hate kids.

1804
01:28:43,858 --> 01:28:47,361
Uh, Andrew. There's someone
inside the cloud.

1805
01:28:47,394 --> 01:28:49,830
What? It's him, isn't it?

1806
01:28:49,864 --> 01:28:51,065
- Power down the cloud.
- No!

1807
01:28:51,098 --> 01:28:53,234
- No.
- And send in security.

1808
01:29:01,342 --> 01:29:03,010
Ron!

1809
01:29:06,447 --> 01:29:08,249
Are you even here?

1810
01:29:16,756 --> 01:29:19,393
Oh, no. Where are you?
Barney Pudowski.

1811
01:29:19,426 --> 01:29:21,262
Um, seventh grade.

1812
01:29:22,396 --> 01:29:24,098
Nonsuch Middle School.

1813
01:29:29,537 --> 01:29:30,905
Uh... What is this?

1814
01:29:32,006 --> 01:29:33,908
<i>Powering down.</i>

1815
01:29:33,941 --> 01:29:35,843
- What's happening?
- <i>System at 10%.</i>

1816
01:29:35,876 --> 01:29:38,412
- No. No, no, no.
- <i>5%.</i>

1817
01:29:39,547 --> 01:29:40,780
<i>2%.</i>

1818
01:29:41,115 --> 01:29:42,149
No!

1819
01:29:47,655 --> 01:29:50,291
Ron, I'll never find you.

1820
01:29:50,991 --> 01:29:52,960
And you'll never find me.

1821
01:29:55,329 --> 01:29:56,931
Find me.

1822
01:29:58,332 --> 01:29:59,934
Find me!

1823
01:30:05,372 --> 01:30:06,706
Please.

1824
01:30:21,188 --> 01:30:23,357
Ron, I'm coming!

1825
01:30:35,636 --> 01:30:36,769
Ron!

1826
01:30:36,803 --> 01:30:38,305
Come on, come on!

1827
01:30:39,440 --> 01:30:40,441
Yes! I'm in.

1828
01:30:41,741 --> 01:30:43,711
Barney! He made it.

1829
01:30:43,743 --> 01:30:46,480
I found you!
I did it! I found you!

1830
01:30:46,513 --> 01:30:48,382
Uh, desk, desk.

1831
01:30:49,717 --> 01:30:51,418
Oh! Okay. Uh...

1832
01:30:53,153 --> 01:30:54,455
Here we go.

1833
01:31:03,864 --> 01:31:06,300
Hi, Absalom?

1834
01:31:06,333 --> 01:31:08,269
Ron, it's you!

1835
01:31:10,770 --> 01:31:13,540
Now I know
what's wrong with him.

1836
01:31:13,574 --> 01:31:16,477
Ron never had my algorithm.

1837
01:31:18,145 --> 01:31:19,546
Whoa!

1838
01:31:19,580 --> 01:31:21,448
That's his code?

1839
01:31:21,482 --> 01:31:23,884
It's beautiful. Like...

1840
01:31:24,718 --> 01:31:25,919
Alive.

1841
01:31:31,191 --> 01:31:33,294
<i>♪ Dikky, dikky, dakka ♪</i>

1842
01:31:33,327 --> 01:31:34,962
Hey, Ron. They turned you
into electricity...

1843
01:31:34,995 --> 01:31:35,963
<i>♪ Dikky, dikky, dikky, dakka
Dikky, dikky, dakka ♪</i>

1844
01:31:35,996 --> 01:31:36,697
...and then put
you inside a rock.

1845
01:31:36,730 --> 01:31:38,098
Electricity is best.

1846
01:31:38,132 --> 01:31:40,200
- You are so annoying!
- Whoa, whoa...

1847
01:31:40,234 --> 01:31:42,036
Please slap my hand
to show we are bonding.

1848
01:31:42,069 --> 01:31:44,738
I am within six feet.

1849
01:31:44,772 --> 01:31:46,340
Okay. Then just stay that way,
all right?

1850
01:31:46,373 --> 01:31:49,310
'Cause we gotta get out
of here! Come on, Ron.

1851
01:31:49,343 --> 01:31:50,377
Ron?

1852
01:31:51,378 --> 01:31:52,646
Ron?

1853
01:31:52,680 --> 01:31:54,348
Not, not your friends.

1854
01:31:55,683 --> 01:31:57,284
I know. I...

1855
01:31:57,318 --> 01:31:59,553
They are not having fun.

1856
01:32:22,943 --> 01:32:24,712
It's weird.

1857
01:32:24,745 --> 01:32:28,382
I used to think
that I was the lonely one.

1858
01:32:28,415 --> 01:32:30,751
They need to upgrade to a Ron.

1859
01:32:30,784 --> 01:32:33,220
I am for making friends.

1860
01:32:33,253 --> 01:32:36,390
What?
You mean, for real?

1861
01:32:36,423 --> 01:32:38,926
Uh, upgrade them
so they'd all be like you?

1862
01:32:38,959 --> 01:32:40,661
Please connect me
to the Bubble network.

1863
01:32:40,694 --> 01:32:43,564
Two hundred and twenty-five
million Rons out there!

1864
01:32:43,597 --> 01:32:44,932
Please connect me.

1865
01:32:44,965 --> 01:32:47,836
It would be insane!
I mean, amazing, but...

1866
01:32:47,868 --> 01:32:49,403
It will be fun.

1867
01:32:49,436 --> 01:32:50,471
Huh.

1868
01:32:50,504 --> 01:32:54,141
We're right here.
In the middle of the network.

1869
01:32:54,174 --> 01:32:56,744
Maybe we could really do this.

1870
01:32:56,777 --> 01:32:59,413
It's our one chance.
Now or never.

1871
01:33:01,648 --> 01:33:03,217
- Systems are down.
- It won't open!

1872
01:33:03,250 --> 01:33:06,320
Uh... Come on, Barney.
What are they doing?

1873
01:33:06,353 --> 01:33:09,256
"Upgrade all B-Bots
to be like Ron."

1874
01:33:09,289 --> 01:33:13,660
Ron's code! Of course.
His code is the fix to mine!

1875
01:33:13,694 --> 01:33:15,462
I can help them.

1876
01:33:15,496 --> 01:33:18,899
Marc? He's helping us.
This is how we do it.

1877
01:33:18,932 --> 01:33:20,701
- Yes!
- Come on, kid, open up!

1878
01:33:20,734 --> 01:33:21,769
Okay, what do I do?

1879
01:33:21,802 --> 01:33:24,104
Um, reboot... Wait!

1880
01:33:24,138 --> 01:33:26,440
Please connect me
to the Bubble network.

1881
01:33:26,473 --> 01:33:28,075
Oh! Finally, buddy.

1882
01:33:28,108 --> 01:33:31,678
Okay. Hold on tight, guys.
You're all getting a Ron!

1883
01:33:37,217 --> 01:33:39,553
Ron. Wait,
where are you going?

1884
01:33:39,586 --> 01:33:41,288
Into the network.

1885
01:33:41,321 --> 01:33:42,322
No. No way.

1886
01:33:42,356 --> 01:33:44,691
You just copy your code
and send that.

1887
01:33:44,725 --> 01:33:46,326
The settings
have not been uploaded.

1888
01:33:46,360 --> 01:33:48,462
No, no, no.
His code is fragmenting.

1889
01:33:48,495 --> 01:33:50,597
He'll disappear! No!

1890
01:33:55,402 --> 01:33:57,638
We'll just have
to go. Forget it.

1891
01:33:57,671 --> 01:33:59,573
Come on.
I'm not leaving you behind.

1892
01:33:59,606 --> 01:34:01,041
Barney.

1893
01:34:01,074 --> 01:34:03,744
I am for making friends.

1894
01:34:03,777 --> 01:34:05,479
What?

1895
01:34:05,512 --> 01:34:06,747
No. You're coming with me.

1896
01:34:06,780 --> 01:34:09,249
How to be a friend.

1897
01:34:10,819 --> 01:34:11,886
You taught me.

1898
01:34:16,957 --> 01:34:20,561
No. Stay with me. Remember?

1899
01:34:21,695 --> 01:34:23,697
Stay friends.

1900
01:34:24,431 --> 01:34:25,799
We can fix it.

1901
01:34:25,834 --> 01:34:27,468
You and me.

1902
01:34:30,370 --> 01:34:31,538
Now or never.

1903
01:34:39,580 --> 01:34:40,514
I guess we'll...

1904
01:34:40,547 --> 01:34:43,116
we'll swap them all
for a good one.

1905
01:34:44,751 --> 01:34:46,453
The best one.

1906
01:34:48,722 --> 01:34:52,493
Go, Ron. You don't have
to stay within six feet.

1907
01:34:52,526 --> 01:34:55,028
Go. Be everywhere.

1908
01:34:55,062 --> 01:34:57,331
<i>Adios,</i> Absalom.

1909
01:34:59,600 --> 01:35:01,435
<i>Arrivederci,</i> Ron Bintscatsco.

1910
01:35:45,078 --> 01:35:46,814
- Come on. What is that?
- What's happening?

1911
01:35:50,852 --> 01:35:52,152
Whoo-hoo!

1912
01:35:59,059 --> 01:36:00,260
Hi.

1913
01:36:00,694 --> 01:36:01,695
Uh...

1914
01:36:02,830 --> 01:36:05,165
I, uh, took a wrong turn.

1915
01:36:06,066 --> 01:36:07,634
Oh. Uh...

1916
01:36:08,068 --> 01:36:09,169
Right.

1917
01:36:09,202 --> 01:36:10,905
This way, please.

1918
01:36:13,674 --> 01:36:14,708
<i>We got him.</i>

1919
01:36:14,741 --> 01:36:16,743
Finally. Job done.

1920
01:36:19,346 --> 01:36:21,381
Uh, the cameras.

1921
01:36:22,115 --> 01:36:23,750
Barney! Hey! There he is!

1922
01:36:23,784 --> 01:36:25,053
Oh, Barney!

1923
01:36:25,085 --> 01:36:26,888
Move it along.
Everybody outta here.

1924
01:36:26,921 --> 01:36:27,922
Did you...?

1925
01:36:27,956 --> 01:36:29,189
I'm gonna tell
you everything, Dad.

1926
01:36:29,222 --> 01:36:30,757
On the way home.

1927
01:36:30,791 --> 01:36:33,327
Okay. Great.

1928
01:36:35,964 --> 01:36:39,099
Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo! Etcetera.

1929
01:36:39,800 --> 01:36:41,768
Sorry. Just, um... Uh...

1930
01:36:41,802 --> 01:36:43,437
Where were we?

1931
01:36:46,173 --> 01:36:48,508
<i>A trick! Data harvesting units
controlled by us.</i>

1932
01:36:48,542 --> 01:36:52,646
<i>So we can sell
them stuff. I hate kids!</i>

1933
01:36:57,150 --> 01:37:02,289
You know, I've loved my time
as Bubble CEO,

1934
01:37:02,322 --> 01:37:04,591
and I wanna thank you all
for your support

1935
01:37:04,625 --> 01:37:07,829
over the last
32 historic hours.

1936
01:37:07,862 --> 01:37:12,733
But I need to go now
to spend more time with my...

1937
01:37:12,766 --> 01:37:14,134
contacts.

1938
01:37:14,167 --> 01:37:16,838
So, please welcome back

1939
01:37:16,871 --> 01:37:19,139
Marc Wydell.

1940
01:37:21,642 --> 01:37:24,946
Marc! Marc! Marc!

1941
01:37:28,482 --> 01:37:32,619
Welcome to the future
of friendship.

1942
01:37:45,766 --> 01:37:47,801
- See you later.
- Here we go again.

1943
01:37:47,835 --> 01:37:48,836
It's gonna get weird.

1944
01:37:48,870 --> 01:37:50,905
- That way is good.
- This way is good.

1945
01:37:52,773 --> 01:37:55,575
Hey! What happened to
staying within six feet?

1946
01:37:55,609 --> 01:37:58,813
Guys, where's my troll bot?
Wait...

1947
01:37:59,579 --> 01:38:00,480
I get to choose.

1948
01:38:02,116 --> 01:38:04,118
K-pop? Are you kidding me?

1949
01:38:04,152 --> 01:38:07,155
Three months it's been
like this. Come back.

1950
01:38:07,187 --> 01:38:08,655
Come on, dude.

1951
01:38:10,323 --> 01:38:12,292
<i>So, here I am again.</i>

1952
01:38:12,325 --> 01:38:16,229
<i>Eighteen minutes
of recess fun.</i>

1953
01:38:16,263 --> 01:38:18,799
<i>Thanks, Ron. You fixed me.</i>

1954
01:38:18,833 --> 01:38:20,434
<i>And everyone else.</i>

1955
01:38:20,467 --> 01:38:21,768
Hey! We don't know them.

1956
01:38:21,802 --> 01:38:24,138
I get to choose your friends.
And I choose everyone!

1957
01:38:24,172 --> 01:38:26,306
Friend request.
Friend request.

1958
01:38:27,175 --> 01:38:29,077
- Hey.
- Friend request.

1959
01:38:29,110 --> 01:38:31,979
You've changed the world,
Barney Pudowski.

1960
01:38:32,013 --> 01:38:33,346
How cool is that?

1961
01:38:33,380 --> 01:38:35,749
- Friend request.
- Friend request.

1962
01:38:36,918 --> 01:38:38,251
Not just me.

1963
01:38:39,187 --> 01:38:40,454
Hey! Oh, my gosh!

1964
01:38:40,487 --> 01:38:42,789
Aren't you that girl
that got... You know.

1965
01:38:43,825 --> 01:38:45,193
Video not found.

1966
01:38:45,225 --> 01:38:46,526
Oh. My bad.

1967
01:38:47,128 --> 01:38:48,462
Thanks.

1968
01:38:48,495 --> 01:38:49,629
Come on.

1969
01:38:50,263 --> 01:38:51,398
- Hi, Barney!
- Hey!

1970
01:38:51,431 --> 01:38:52,499
My bot does
that every time.

1971
01:38:52,532 --> 01:38:53,633
- Hey there.
- Hi.

1972
01:38:53,667 --> 01:38:54,869
- It's so weird.
- Hi.

1973
01:38:54,902 --> 01:38:57,537
- He's, like, king of the bots.
- They love Pudowski.

1974
01:38:57,571 --> 01:39:00,908
Barn, you have got to get back
in that Bubble cloud place.

1975
01:39:02,043 --> 01:39:04,145
And get this bot to stop
making up its own game rules.

1976
01:39:04,178 --> 01:39:06,114
Free upgrades
for everyone!

1977
01:39:06,147 --> 01:39:08,348
How am I ever gonna win?

1978
01:39:08,381 --> 01:39:10,283
Dude! We gotta tell 'em!

1979
01:39:10,317 --> 01:39:13,653
You pranked a global
freakin' tech giant, man!

1980
01:39:13,687 --> 01:39:16,124
Please let me stream
the reveal, bro, please?

1981
01:39:16,157 --> 01:39:18,625
Take it from me, Rich.
Fame is overrated.

1982
01:39:18,658 --> 01:39:20,128
Look what I brought.

1983
01:39:20,161 --> 01:39:21,863
- I'll take one.
- One for everyone.

1984
01:39:21,896 --> 01:39:23,730
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

1985
01:39:23,764 --> 01:39:26,234
Barney! Hey! You see?

1986
01:39:26,266 --> 01:39:28,702
I told you my bench
would work!

1987
01:39:28,735 --> 01:39:30,771
Oh!

1988
01:39:30,804 --> 01:39:32,940
Yeah. It's great.

1989
01:39:34,108 --> 01:39:36,610
Mmm. Is all your
gran's food this good?

1990
01:39:36,643 --> 01:39:39,479
Come... Come over sometime.
Hang out.

1991
01:39:39,513 --> 01:39:41,581
I know you're dying to
see my rock collection.

1992
01:39:41,615 --> 01:39:43,818
Will she set us on fire again?

1993
01:39:43,851 --> 01:39:44,952
- Hope so.
- That was so fun!

1994
01:39:44,986 --> 01:39:46,586
But you're gonna have to talk
to that goat,

1995
01:39:46,620 --> 01:39:48,923
because I do not want
any more of my jewelry

1996
01:39:48,956 --> 01:39:50,124
going through its intestines.

1997
