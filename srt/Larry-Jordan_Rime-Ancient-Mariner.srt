1
00:02:34,837 --> 00:02:39,462
It is an ancient Mariner,
And he stoppeth one of three.

2
00:02:40,163 --> 00:02:43,694
"By thy long grey beard and glittering eye,
Now wherefore stopp'st thou me?

3
00:02:44,163 --> 00:02:46,960
"The Bridegroom's doors are opened wide,
And I am next of kin;

4
00:02:47,045 --> 00:02:49,889
The guests are met, the feast is set:
May'st hear the merry din."

5
00:02:51,202 --> 00:02:56,045
He holds him with his skinny hand,
"There was a ship," quoth he.

6
00:02:56,608 --> 00:03:00,788
"Hold off! unhand me, grey-beard loon!"
Eftsoons his hand dropt he.

7
00:03:01,233 --> 00:03:06,069
He holds him with his glittering eye—
The Wedding-Guest stood still,

8
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:10,222
And listens like a three years child:

9
00:03:11,027 --> 00:03:12,967
The Mariner hath his will.

10
00:03:14,249 --> 00:03:18,116
The Wedding-Guest sat on a stone:
He cannot chuse but hear;

11
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:23,116
And thus spake on that ancient man,
The bright-eyed Mariner.

12
00:03:24,967 --> 00:03:31,397
The ship was cheered, the harbour cleared,
Merrily did we drop

13
00:03:31,429 --> 00:03:34,827
Below the kirk, below the hill,
Below the light-house top.

14
00:03:35,374 --> 00:03:38,733
The Sun came up upon the left,
Out of the sea came he!

15
00:03:39,148 --> 00:03:43,682
And he shone bright, and on the right
Went down into the sea.

16
00:03:45,394 --> 00:03:49,947
Higher and higher every day,
Till over the mast at noon—

17
00:03:50,588 --> 00:03:53,962
The Wedding-Guest here beat his breast,
For he heard the loud bassoon.

18
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:57,088
The bride hath paced into the hall,
Red as a rose is she;

19
00:03:57,143 --> 00:04:00,651
Nodding their heads before her goes
The merry minstrelsy.

20
00:04:01,878 --> 00:04:06,822
The Wedding-Guest he beat his breast,
Yet he cannot chuse but hear;

21
00:04:07,198 --> 00:04:12,111
And thus spake on that ancient man,
The bright-eyed Mariner.

22
00:04:13,112 --> 00:04:18,729
And now the STORM-BLAST came, and he
Was tyrannous and strong:

23
00:04:18,971 --> 00:04:23,440
He struck with his o'ertaking wings,
And chased south along.

24
00:04:24,049 --> 00:04:29,518
With sloping masts and dipping prow,
As who pursued with yell and blow

25
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:34,971
Still treads the shadow of his foe
And forward bends his head,

26
00:04:35,417 --> 00:04:42,697
The ship drove fast, loud roared the blast,
And southward aye we fled.

27
00:04:44,214 --> 00:04:50,026
And now there came both mist and snow,
And it grew wondrous cold:

28
00:04:51,073 --> 00:04:56,094
And ice, mast-high, came floating by,

29
00:04:56,899 --> 00:04:58,695
As green as emerald.

30
00:04:59,628 --> 00:05:04,643
And through the drifts the snowy clifts
Did send a dismal sheen:

31
00:05:05,417 --> 00:05:08,432
Nor shapes of men nor beasts we ken—

32
00:05:08,967 --> 00:05:12,197
The ice was all between.

33
00:05:12,846 --> 00:05:17,666
The ice was here, the ice was there,
The ice was all around:

34
00:05:17,753 --> 00:05:23,127
It cracked and growled, and roared and howled,
Like noises in a swound!

35
00:05:24,182 --> 00:05:28,384
At length did cross an Albatross:

36
00:05:29,821 --> 00:05:31,799
Thorough the fog it came;

37
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:37,135
As if it had been a Christian soul,
We hailed it in God's name.

38
00:05:38,667 --> 00:05:43,276
It ate the food it ne'er had eat,
And round and round it flew.

39
00:05:44,065 --> 00:05:48,494
The ice did split with a thunder-fit;
The helmsman steered us through!

40
00:05:49,284 --> 00:05:54,846
And a good south wind sprung up behind;
The Albatross did follow,

41
00:05:55,705 --> 00:06:00,143
And every day, for food or play,
Came to the mariners' hollo!

42
00:06:01,331 --> 00:06:08,030
In mist or cloud, on mast or shroud,
It perched for vespers nine;

43
00:06:08,484 --> 00:06:12,856
Whiles all the night, through fog-smoke white,

44
00:06:14,137 --> 00:06:16,499
Glimmered the white Moon-shine.

45
00:06:17,607 --> 00:06:21,226
"God save thee, ancient Mariner!
From the fiends, that plague thee thus!—

46
00:06:21,937 --> 00:06:23,851
Why look'st thou so?"—

47
00:06:25,431 --> 00:06:27,718
With my cross-bow...

48
00:06:29,429 --> 00:06:30,849
I...

49
00:06:31,771 --> 00:06:32,931
shot...

50
00:06:33,971 --> 00:06:35,451
...the Albatross.

51
00:06:38,787 --> 00:06:42,638
The Sun now rose upon the right:
Out of the sea came he,

52
00:06:42,748 --> 00:06:48,021
Still hid in mist, and on the left
Went down into the sea.

53
00:06:48,865 --> 00:06:54,982
And the good south wind still blew behind
But no sweet bird did follow,

54
00:06:55,505 --> 00:07:00,099
Nor any day for food or play
Came to the mariners' hollo!

55
00:07:01,568 --> 00:07:07,615
And I had done an hellish thing,
And it would work 'em woe:

56
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:12,021
For all averred, I had killed the bird
That made the breeze to blow.

57
00:07:12,638 --> 00:07:17,848
Ah wretch! said they, the bird to slay
That made the breeze to blow!

58
00:07:18,982 --> 00:07:24,263
Nor dim nor red, like God's own head,
The glorious Sun uprist:

59
00:07:24,904 --> 00:07:28,544
Then all averred, I had killed the bird
That brought the fog and mist.

60
00:07:29,264 --> 00:07:34,216
'Twas right, said they, such birds to slay,
That bring the fog and mist.

61
00:07:35,604 --> 00:07:42,880
The fair breeze blew, the white foam flew,
The furrow followed free:

62
00:07:43,725 --> 00:07:50,552
We were the first that ever burst
Into that silent sea.

63
00:07:53,107 --> 00:07:57,177
Down dropt the breeze, the sails dropt down,

64
00:07:58,468 --> 00:08:00,396
'Twas sad as sad could be;

65
00:08:01,373 --> 00:08:05,326
And we did speak only to break
The silence of the sea!

66
00:08:07,693 --> 00:08:13,630
All in a hot and copper sky,
The bloody Sun, at noon,

67
00:08:13,795 --> 00:08:17,302
Right up above the mast did stand,
No bigger than the Moon.

68
00:08:19,395 --> 00:08:21,784
Day after day, day after day,

69
00:08:22,011 --> 00:08:26,458
We stuck, nor breath nor motion;

70
00:08:27,916 --> 00:08:32,747
As idle as a painted ship
Upon a painted ocean.

71
00:08:34,018 --> 00:08:39,327
Water, water, every where,
And all the boards did shrink;

72
00:08:39,617 --> 00:08:42,678
Water, water, every where,

73
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:46,175
Nor any drop to drink.

74
00:08:47,416 --> 00:08:52,388
The very deep did rot: O Christ!
That ever this should be!

75
00:08:53,747 --> 00:08:57,845
Yea, slimy things did crawl with legs

76
00:08:57,869 --> 00:09:00,177
Upon the slimy sea.

77
00:09:00,802 --> 00:09:06,495
About, about, in reel and rout
The death-fires danced at night;

78
00:09:06,808 --> 00:09:12,204
The water, like a witch's oils,
Burnt green, and blue and white.

79
00:09:13,356 --> 00:09:17,649
And some in dreams assured were
Of the spirit that plagued us so:

80
00:09:17,919 --> 00:09:22,845
Nine fathom deep he had followed us
From the land of mist and snow.

81
00:09:23,067 --> 00:09:27,782
And every tongue, through utter drought,
Was withered at the root;

82
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:34,677
We could not speak, no more than if
We had been choked with soot.

83
00:09:36,523 --> 00:09:42,469
Ah! well a-day! what evil looks
Had I from old and young!

84
00:09:43,404 --> 00:09:47,983
Instead of the cross, the Albatross

85
00:09:48,881 --> 00:09:50,923
About my neck was hung.

86
00:09:53,289 --> 00:10:01,622
There passed a weary time.  Each throat
Was parched, and glazed each eye.

87
00:10:02,337 --> 00:10:05,251
A weary time! a weary time!

88
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:09,627
How glazed each weary eye,

89
00:10:10,199 --> 00:10:15,349
When looking westward, I beheld
A something in the sky.

90
00:10:17,138 --> 00:10:20,841
At first it seemed a little speck,
And then it seemed a mist:

91
00:10:21,271 --> 00:10:25,142
It moved and moved, and took at last
A certain shape, I wist.

92
00:10:26,378 --> 00:10:31,755
A speck, a mist, a shape, I wist!
And still it neared and neared:

93
00:10:32,413 --> 00:10:36,862
As if it dodged a water-sprite,
It plunged and tacked and veered.

94
00:10:37,448 --> 00:10:43,884
With throats unslaked, with black lips baked,
We could not laugh nor wail;

95
00:10:45,033 --> 00:10:51,682
Through utter drought all dumb we stood!
I bit my arm, I sucked the blood,

96
00:10:52,436 --> 00:10:56,937
And cried, A sail! a sail!

97
00:10:59,836 --> 00:11:04,972
With throats unslaked, with black lips baked,
Agape they heard me call:

98
00:11:05,372 --> 00:11:10,227
Gramercy! they for joy did grin,
And all at once their breath drew in,

99
00:11:10,847 --> 00:11:12,847
As they were drinking all.

100
00:11:13,802 --> 00:11:18,399
See! see! (I cried) she tacks no more!

101
00:11:19,087 --> 00:11:20,553
Hither to work us weal;

102
00:11:21,421 --> 00:11:27,207
Without a breeze, without a tide,
She steadies with upright keel!

103
00:11:29,157 --> 00:11:33,019
The western wave was all a-flame
The day was well nigh done!

104
00:11:33,524 --> 00:11:36,906
Almost upon the western wave
Rested the broad bright Sun;

105
00:11:37,058 --> 00:11:43,449
When that strange shape drove suddenly
Betwixt us and the Sun.

106
00:11:44,917 --> 00:11:51,457
And straight the Sun was flecked with bars,
(Heaven's Mother send us grace!)

107
00:11:52,649 --> 00:11:58,049
As if through a dungeon-grate he peered,
With broad and burning face.

108
00:11:59,893 --> 00:12:05,736
Alas! (thought I, and my heart beat loud)
How fast she nears and nears!

109
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:11,068
Are those her sails that glance in the Sun,
Like restless gossameres!

110
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:14,880
Are those her ribs through which the Sun
Did peer, as through a grate?

111
00:12:15,048 --> 00:12:17,393
And is that Woman all her crew?

112
00:12:18,791 --> 00:12:23,809
Is that a Death? and are there two?

113
00:12:26,006 --> 00:12:30,177
Is Death that woman's mate?

114
00:12:31,787 --> 00:12:37,183
Her lips were red, her looks were free,
Her locks were yellow as gold:

115
00:12:38,334 --> 00:12:43,488
Her skin was as white as leprosy,

116
00:12:45,551 --> 00:12:52,570
The Night-Mare Life-in-Death was she,

117
00:12:54,465 --> 00:12:57,590
Who thicks man's blood with cold.

118
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:03,787
The naked hulk alongside came,
And the twain were casting dice;

119
00:13:05,498 --> 00:13:08,647
"The game is done!  I've won!  I've won!"

120
00:13:09,351 --> 00:13:13,061
Quoth she, and whistles thrice.

121
00:13:15,116 --> 00:13:20,219
The Sun's rim dips; the stars rush out:

122
00:13:21,643 --> 00:13:24,161
At one stride comes the dark;

123
00:13:26,103 --> 00:13:31,903
With far-heard whisper, o'er the sea.
Off shot the spectre-bark.

124
00:13:33,082 --> 00:13:39,463
We listened and looked sideways up!
Fear at my heart, as at a cup,

125
00:13:39,585 --> 00:13:41,349
My life-blood seemed to sip!

126
00:13:42,456 --> 00:13:47,925
The stars were dim, and thick the night,

127
00:13:49,277 --> 00:13:53,201
The steersman's face by his lamp gleamed white;

128
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:58,781
From the sails the dew did drip—
Till clombe above the eastern bar

129
00:13:58,891 --> 00:14:03,210
The horned Moon, with one bright star

130
00:14:03,749 --> 00:14:05,460
Within the nether tip.

131
00:14:07,434 --> 00:14:12,441
One after one, by the star-dogged Moon
Too quick for groan or sigh,

132
00:14:12,906 --> 00:14:17,016
Each turned his face with a ghastly pang,

133
00:14:18,265 --> 00:14:20,453
And cursed me with his eye.

134
00:14:22,407 --> 00:14:25,956
Four times fifty living men,

135
00:14:26,979 --> 00:14:29,697
(And I heard nor sigh nor groan)

136
00:14:31,087 --> 00:14:35,320
With heavy thump, a lifeless lump,

137
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:42,126
They dropped down one by one.

138
00:14:43,621 --> 00:14:48,814
The souls did from their bodies fly,—
They fled to bliss or woe!

139
00:14:50,761 --> 00:14:55,045
And every soul, it passed me by,

140
00:14:57,276 --> 00:15:02,445
Like the whizz of my cross-bow!

141
00:15:03,995 --> 00:15:08,014
"I fear thee, ancient Mariner!
I fear thy skinny hand!

142
00:15:08,518 --> 00:15:12,168
And thou art long, and lank, and brown,
As is the ribbed sea-sand.

143
00:15:12,387 --> 00:15:17,495
"I fear thee and thy glittering eye,
And thy skinny hand, so brown."—

144
00:15:17,933 --> 00:15:22,579
Fear not, fear not, thou Wedding-Guest!

145
00:15:24,119 --> 00:15:28,614
This body dropt not down.

146
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:36,347
Alone, alone, all, all alone,

147
00:15:37,284 --> 00:15:40,222
Alone on a wide wide sea!

148
00:15:41,047 --> 00:15:45,108
And never a saint took pity on
My soul in agony.

149
00:15:47,249 --> 00:15:51,036
The many men, so beautiful!

150
00:15:52,247 --> 00:15:56,392
And they all dead did lie:

151
00:15:58,054 --> 00:16:04,697
And a thousand thousand slimy things

152
00:16:06,806 --> 00:16:08,517
and so did I.

153
00:16:10,439 --> 00:16:16,140
I looked upon the rotting sea,
And drew my eyes away;

154
00:16:17,336 --> 00:16:22,347
I looked upon the rotting deck,
And there the dead men lay.

155
00:16:24,446 --> 00:16:28,350
I looked to Heaven, and tried to pray:

156
00:16:30,286 --> 00:16:33,728
But or ever a prayer had gusht,
A wicked whisper came,

157
00:16:34,908 --> 00:16:40,418
and made my heart as dry as dust.

158
00:16:41,767 --> 00:16:45,825
I closed my lids, and kept them close,

159
00:16:46,848 --> 00:16:49,416
And the balls like pulses beat;

160
00:16:50,025 --> 00:16:53,849
For the sky and the sea,
and the sea and the sky

161
00:16:54,664 --> 00:16:59,597
Lay like a load on my weary eye,

162
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:06,448
And the dead were at my feet.

163
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:13,444
The cold sweat melted from their limbs,

164
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:16,362
Nor rot nor reek did they:

165
00:17:17,345 --> 00:17:23,212
The look with which they looked on me
Had never passed away.

166
00:17:25,597 --> 00:17:29,733
An orphan's curse would drag to Hell
A spirit from on high;

167
00:17:30,954 --> 00:17:36,574
But oh! more horrible than that
Is a curse in a dead man's eye!

168
00:17:39,379 --> 00:17:41,882
Seven days, seven nights,

169
00:17:44,499 --> 00:17:46,513
I saw that curse,

170
00:17:49,627 --> 00:17:55,171
And yet I could not die.

171
00:17:57,089 --> 00:18:02,961
The moving Moon went up the sky,
And no where did abide:

172
00:18:03,563 --> 00:18:08,427
Softly she was going up,
And a star or two beside.

173
00:18:09,967 --> 00:18:12,834
Her beams bemocked the sultry main,

174
00:18:13,599 --> 00:18:16,396
Like April hoar-frost spread;

175
00:18:17,622 --> 00:18:23,809
But where the ship's huge shadow lay,
The charmed water burnt alway

176
00:18:24,563 --> 00:18:28,614
A still and awful red.

177
00:18:29,943 --> 00:18:35,001
Beyond the shadow of the ship,
I watched the water-snakes:

178
00:18:35,877 --> 00:18:41,164
They moved in tracks of shining white,
And when they reared,

179
00:18:42,187 --> 00:18:47,361
the elfish light fell off in hoary flakes.

180
00:18:49,332 --> 00:18:55,097
Within the shadow of the ship
I watched their rich attire:

181
00:18:55,761 --> 00:19:00,846
Blue, glossy green, and velvet black,

182
00:19:02,399 --> 00:19:06,213
They coiled and swam; and every track

183
00:19:07,059 --> 00:19:10,428
Was a flash of golden fire.

184
00:19:11,724 --> 00:19:15,127
O happy living things!

185
00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:20,261
No tongue their beauty might declare:

186
00:19:21,825 --> 00:19:26,099
A spring of love gushed from my heart,

187
00:19:26,787 --> 00:19:29,829
And I blessed them unaware:

188
00:19:30,932 --> 00:19:33,990
Sure my kind saint took pity on me,

189
00:19:35,095 --> 00:19:38,543
And I blessed them unaware.

190
00:19:39,557 --> 00:19:44,391
The self same moment I could pray;

191
00:19:46,306 --> 00:19:49,372
And from my neck so free

192
00:19:50,301 --> 00:19:55,546
The Albatross fell off, and sank

193
00:19:56,015 --> 00:19:59,745
Like lead into the sea.

194
00:20:02,583 --> 00:20:04,761
Oh sleep!

195
00:20:06,789 --> 00:20:11,198
It is a gentle thing,
Beloved from pole to pole!

196
00:20:11,596 --> 00:20:16,870
To Mary Queen the praise be given!
She sent the gentle sleep from Heaven,

197
00:20:17,198 --> 00:20:19,198
That slid into my soul.

198
00:20:21,103 --> 00:20:25,357
The silly buckets on the deck,
That had so long remained,

199
00:20:27,457 --> 00:20:31,187
I dreamt that they were filled with dew;

200
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:37,003
And when I awoke, it rained.

201
00:20:39,105 --> 00:20:43,527
My lips were wet, my throat was cold,

202
00:20:44,519 --> 00:20:47,268
My garments all were dank;

203
00:20:48,178 --> 00:20:53,991
Sure I had drunken in my dreams,
And still my body drank.

204
00:20:55,444 --> 00:20:59,337
I moved, and could not feel my limbs:
I was so light—almost

205
00:20:59,362 --> 00:21:03,178
I was so light—almost
I thought that I had died in sleep,

206
00:21:03,763 --> 00:21:05,763
And was a blessed ghost.

207
00:21:07,299 --> 00:21:11,913
And soon I heard a roaring wind:
It did not come anear;

208
00:21:12,515 --> 00:21:17,767
But with its sound it shook the sails,
That were so thin and sere.

209
00:21:18,453 --> 00:21:24,317
The upper air burst into life!
And a hundred fire-flags sheen,

210
00:21:24,426 --> 00:21:27,305
To and fro they were hurried about!
And to and fro, and in and out,

211
00:21:27,423 --> 00:21:29,852
The wan stars danced between.

212
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:36,375
And the coming wind did roar more loud,
And the sails did sigh like sedge;

213
00:21:36,665 --> 00:21:40,258
And the rain poured down from one black cloud;

214
00:21:41,719 --> 00:21:44,391
And the Moon was at its edge.

215
00:21:45,938 --> 00:21:50,500
The thick black cloud was cleft, and still

216
00:21:51,032 --> 00:21:53,032
The Moon was at its side:

217
00:21:54,571 --> 00:21:58,438
Like waters shot from some high crag,

218
00:21:59,290 --> 00:22:04,727
The lightning fell with never a jag,
A river steep and wide.

219
00:22:06,188 --> 00:22:09,610
The loud wind never reached the ship,

220
00:22:09,805 --> 00:22:12,820
Yet now the ship moved on!

221
00:22:13,906 --> 00:22:19,641
Beneath the lightning and the Moon
The dead men gave a groan.

222
00:22:20,602 --> 00:22:25,508
They groaned, they stirred, they all uprose,

223
00:22:26,891 --> 00:22:29,820
Nor spake, nor moved their eyes;

224
00:22:31,415 --> 00:22:35,094
It had been strange, even in a dream,

225
00:22:35,899 --> 00:22:38,860
To have seen those dead men rise.

226
00:22:40,563 --> 00:22:45,508
The helmsman steered, the ship moved on;

227
00:22:46,766 --> 00:22:48,766
Yet never a breeze up blew;

228
00:22:50,313 --> 00:22:53,469
The mariners all 'gan work the ropes,
Where they were wont to do:

229
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:56,438
They raised their limbs like lifeless tools—

230
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:00,140
They were a ghastly crew.

231
00:23:01,874 --> 00:23:07,983
The body of my brother's son,
Stood by me, knee to knee:

232
00:23:09,593 --> 00:23:13,584
The body and I pulled at one rope,

233
00:23:15,647 --> 00:23:17,647
But he said nought to me.

234
00:23:20,358 --> 00:23:23,350
"I fear thee, ancient Mariner!"

235
00:23:23,483 --> 00:23:26,655
Be calm, thou Wedding-Guest!

236
00:23:27,226 --> 00:23:32,498
'Twas not those souls that fled in pain,
Which to their corses came again,

237
00:23:33,194 --> 00:23:35,256
But a troop of spirits blest:

238
00:23:36,374 --> 00:23:41,248
For when it dawned—they dropped their arms,
And clustered round the mast;

239
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:47,991
Sweet sounds rose slowly through their mouths,
And from their bodies passed.

240
00:23:48,218 --> 00:23:53,623
Around, around, flew each sweet sound,
Then darted to the Sun;

241
00:23:54,795 --> 00:23:58,307
Slowly the sounds came back again,

242
00:23:58,631 --> 00:24:01,776
Now mixed, now one by one.

243
00:24:03,145 --> 00:24:07,819
Sometimes a-dropping from the sky
I heard the sky-lark sing;

244
00:24:08,631 --> 00:24:11,436
Sometimes all little birds that are,

245
00:24:12,171 --> 00:24:16,264
How they seemed to fill the sea and air
With their sweet jargoning!

246
00:24:17,358 --> 00:24:22,733
And now 'twas like all instruments,
Now like a lonely flute;

247
00:24:24,499 --> 00:24:29,295
And now it is an angel's song,
That makes the Heavens be mute.

248
00:24:32,757 --> 00:24:37,991
It ceased; yet still the sails made on

249
00:24:38,726 --> 00:24:41,717
A pleasant noise till noon,

250
00:24:42,804 --> 00:24:47,842
A noise like of a hidden brook
In the leafy month of June,

251
00:24:48,257 --> 00:24:52,967
That to the sleeping woods all night
Singeth a quiet tune.

252
00:24:55,749 --> 00:24:59,061
Till noon we quietly sailed on,

253
00:25:00,459 --> 00:25:03,319
Yet never a breeze did breathe:

254
00:25:04,679 --> 00:25:07,217
Slowly and smoothly went the ship,

255
00:25:07,819 --> 00:25:10,936
Moved onward from beneath.

256
00:25:12,890 --> 00:25:18,358
Under the keel nine fathom deep,
From the land of mist and snow,

257
00:25:19,163 --> 00:25:20,854
The spirit slid:

258
00:25:21,913 --> 00:25:26,295
and it was he
That made the ship to go.

259
00:25:27,733 --> 00:25:32,655
The sails at noon left off their tune,

260
00:25:34,241 --> 00:25:37,069
And the ship stood still also.

261
00:25:39,345 --> 00:25:44,428
The Sun, right up above the mast,
Had fixed her to the ocean:

262
00:25:46,171 --> 00:25:52,139
But in a minute she 'gan stir,
With a short uneasy motion—

263
00:25:52,811 --> 00:25:55,495
Backwards and forwards half her length

264
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:59,381
With a short uneasy motion.

265
00:26:01,444 --> 00:26:04,889
Then like a pawing horse let go,

266
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:10,577
She made a sudden bound:
It flung the blood into my head,

267
00:26:11,647 --> 00:26:13,881
And I fell down in a swound.

268
00:26:15,749 --> 00:26:19,889
How long in that same fit I lay,
I have not to declare;

269
00:26:20,444 --> 00:26:23,108
But ere my living life returned,

270
00:26:23,835 --> 00:26:27,631
I heard and in my soul discerned

271
00:26:28,726 --> 00:26:32,100
Two Voices in the air.

272
00:26:34,007 --> 00:26:38,327
"Is it he?" quoth one, "Is this the man?

273
00:26:39,241 --> 00:26:44,381
By him who died on cross,
With his cruel bow he laid full low,

274
00:26:44,452 --> 00:26:46,452
The harmless Albatross.

275
00:26:48,064 --> 00:26:53,721
"The spirit who bideth by himself
In the land of mist and snow,

276
00:26:55,166 --> 00:26:59,814
He loved the bird that loved the man

277
00:27:01,768 --> 00:27:04,252
Who shot him with his bow."

278
00:27:05,781 --> 00:27:11,367
The other was a softer voice,
As soft as honey-dew:

279
00:27:12,117 --> 00:27:14,124
Quoth he,

280
00:27:15,484 --> 00:27:20,710
"The man hath penance done,
And penance more will do."

281
00:27:23,307 --> 00:27:27,687
But tell me, tell me! speak again,
Thy soft response renewing—

282
00:27:27,953 --> 00:27:31,281
What makes that ship drive on so fast?

283
00:27:32,094 --> 00:27:34,538
What is the Ocean doing?

284
00:27:35,984 --> 00:27:41,648
Still as a slave before his lord,
The Ocean hath no blast;

285
00:27:42,851 --> 00:27:48,281
His great bright eye most silently
Up to the Moon is cast—

286
00:27:48,766 --> 00:27:53,273
If he may know which way to go;
For she guides him smooth or grim

287
00:27:53,437 --> 00:27:59,023
See, brother, see! how graciously
She looketh down on him.

288
00:28:01,453 --> 00:28:06,679
But why drives on that ship so fast,
Without or wave or wind?

289
00:28:08,172 --> 00:28:11,968
The air is cut away before,
And closes from behind.

290
00:28:12,156 --> 00:28:17,132
Fly, brother, fly! more high, more high
Or we shall be belated:

291
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:22,648
For slow and slow that ship will go,
When the Mariner's trance is abated.

292
00:28:25,437 --> 00:28:26,851
I woke,

293
00:28:28,109 --> 00:28:31,523
and we were sailing on
As in a gentle weather:

294
00:28:32,523 --> 00:28:37,771
'Twas night, calm night, the Moon was high;

295
00:28:39,851 --> 00:28:43,390
The dead men stood together.

296
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:50,390
All stood together on the deck,
For a charnel-dungeon fitter:

297
00:28:50,656 --> 00:28:55,898
All fixed on me their stony eyes,
That in the Moon did glitter.

298
00:28:57,930 --> 00:29:02,968
The pang, the curse, with which they died,

299
00:29:04,203 --> 00:29:06,281
Had never passed away:

300
00:29:07,781 --> 00:29:12,023
I could not draw my eyes from theirs,
Nor turn them up to pray.

301
00:29:13,469 --> 00:29:16,460
And now this spell was snapt:

302
00:29:17,578 --> 00:29:22,623
Once more I viewed the ocean green.
And looked far forth,

303
00:29:24,264 --> 00:29:28,490
yet little saw
Of what had else been seen—

304
00:29:30,741 --> 00:29:36,037
Like one that on a lonesome road
Doth walk in fear and dread,

305
00:29:37,694 --> 00:29:40,287
And having once turned round

306
00:29:41,842 --> 00:29:46,553
walks on,
And turns no more his head;

307
00:29:48,662 --> 00:29:51,443
Because he knows, a frightful fiend

308
00:29:53,116 --> 00:29:56,592
Doth close behind him tread.

309
00:29:59,506 --> 00:30:02,334
But soon there breathed a wind on me,

310
00:30:03,459 --> 00:30:05,459
Nor sound nor motion made:

311
00:30:06,498 --> 00:30:11,787
Its path was not upon the sea,
In ripple or in shade.

312
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:17,756
It raised my hair, it fanned my cheek

313
00:30:18,858 --> 00:30:21,115
Like a meadow-gale of spring—

314
00:30:22,803 --> 00:30:27,076
It mingled strangely with my fears,

315
00:30:28,545 --> 00:30:31,646
Yet it felt like a welcoming.

316
00:30:34,584 --> 00:30:39,397
Swiftly, swiftly flew the ship,
Yet she sailed softly too:

317
00:30:39,686 --> 00:30:43,986
Sweetly, sweetly blew the breeze—

318
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:46,748
On me alone it blew.

319
00:30:48,795 --> 00:30:54,080
Oh! dream of joy! is this indeed

320
00:30:54,771 --> 00:30:58,763
The light-house top I see?
Is this the hill? is this the kirk?

321
00:31:00,029 --> 00:31:02,116
Is this mine own countree!

322
00:31:03,451 --> 00:31:06,896
We drifted o'er the harbour-bar,
And I with sobs did pray—

323
00:31:07,006 --> 00:31:09,779
O let me be awake, my God!

324
00:31:11,224 --> 00:31:13,224
Or let me sleep alway.

325
00:31:17,577 --> 00:31:22,318
The harbour-bay was clear as glass,
So smoothly it was strewn!

326
00:31:23,147 --> 00:31:26,396
And on the bay the moonlight lay,
And the shadow of the moon.

327
00:31:26,967 --> 00:31:31,381
The rock shone bright, the kirk no less,

328
00:31:32,303 --> 00:31:34,303
That stands above the rock:

329
00:31:35,131 --> 00:31:40,920
The moonlight steeped in silentness
The steady weathercock.

330
00:31:42,858 --> 00:31:46,623
And the bay was white with silent light,

331
00:31:48,014 --> 00:31:51,998
Till rising from the same,
Full many shapes, that shadows were,

332
00:31:52,732 --> 00:31:54,443
In crimson colours came.

333
00:31:55,709 --> 00:31:59,013
A little distance from the prow
Those crimson shadows were:

334
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:01,260
I turned my eyes upon the deck—

335
00:32:02,666 --> 00:32:07,572
Oh, Christ! what saw I there!

336
00:32:08,576 --> 00:32:13,212
Each corse lay flat, lifeless and flat,

337
00:32:14,682 --> 00:32:20,108
And, by the holy rood!
A man all light, a seraph-man,

338
00:32:20,694 --> 00:32:22,694
On every corse there stood.

339
00:32:23,954 --> 00:32:28,151
This seraph band, each waved his hand:

340
00:32:28,339 --> 00:32:32,138
It was a heavenly sight!
They stood as signals to the land,

341
00:32:32,779 --> 00:32:35,724
Each one a lovely light:

342
00:32:37,252 --> 00:32:42,747
This seraph-band, each waved his hand,
No voice did they impart—

343
00:32:43,081 --> 00:32:45,289
No voice; but oh!

344
00:32:46,391 --> 00:32:51,768
the silence sank
Like music on my heart.

345
00:32:54,237 --> 00:32:57,027
But soon I heard the dash of oars;
I heard the Pilot's cheer;

346
00:32:57,137 --> 00:33:00,636
My head was turned perforce away,
And I saw a boat appear.

347
00:33:00,943 --> 00:33:04,684
The Pilot, and the Pilot's boy,
I heard them coming fast:

348
00:33:04,985 --> 00:33:09,451
Dear Lord in Heaven! it was a joy
The dead men could not blast.

349
00:33:10,381 --> 00:33:16,313
I saw a third—I heard his voice:
It is the Hermit good!

350
00:33:17,399 --> 00:33:21,221
He singeth loud his godly hymns
That he makes in the wood.

351
00:33:21,979 --> 00:33:27,787
He'll shrieve my soul, he'll wash away
The Albatross's blood.

352
00:33:29,112 --> 00:33:33,295
This Hermit good lives in that wood
Which slopes down to the sea.

353
00:33:33,689 --> 00:33:38,013
How loudly his sweet voice he rears!
He loves to talk with marineres

354
00:33:38,071 --> 00:33:39,929
That come from a far country.

355
00:33:40,839 --> 00:33:45,448
He kneels at morn and noon and eve—
He hath a cushion plump:

356
00:33:46,054 --> 00:33:49,807
It is the moss that wholly hides
The rotted old oak-stump.

357
00:33:51,416 --> 00:33:54,666
The skiff-boat neared: I heard them talk,

358
00:33:55,784 --> 00:33:57,784
"Why this is strange, I trow!

359
00:33:58,156 --> 00:34:01,931
Where are those lights so many and fair,
That signal made but now?"

360
00:34:03,228 --> 00:34:08,240
"Strange, by my faith!" the Hermit said—

361
00:34:09,194 --> 00:34:11,770
"And they answered not our cheer!

362
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:15,797
The planks looked warped! and see those sails,

363
00:34:16,208 --> 00:34:19,858
How thin they are and sere!

364
00:34:20,670 --> 00:34:24,525
I never saw aught like to them,
Unless perchance it were

365
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:29,188
"Brown skeletons of leaves that lag

366
00:34:29,321 --> 00:34:31,321
My forest-brook along;

367
00:34:31,734 --> 00:34:34,299
When the ivy-tod is heavy with snow,

368
00:34:34,386 --> 00:34:37,861
And the owlet whoops to the wolf below,

369
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:40,130
That eats the she-wolf's young."

370
00:34:41,224 --> 00:34:45,842
"Dear Lord! it hath a fiendish look—
(The Pilot made reply)

371
00:34:46,147 --> 00:34:51,067
I am a-feared"—"Push on, push on!"
Said the Hermit cheerily.

372
00:34:51,575 --> 00:34:55,254
The boat came closer to the ship,
But I nor spake nor stirred;

373
00:34:55,301 --> 00:35:00,188
The boat came close beneath the ship,
And straight a sound was heard.

374
00:35:00,665 --> 00:35:04,058
Under the water it rumbled on,
Still louder and more dread:

375
00:35:04,129 --> 00:35:07,379
It reached the ship, it split the bay;

376
00:35:08,809 --> 00:35:13,055
The ship went down like lead.

377
00:35:15,594 --> 00:35:20,204
Stunned by that loud and dreadful sound,
Which sky and ocean smote,

378
00:35:20,669 --> 00:35:26,392
Like one that hath been seven days drowned
My body lay afloat;

379
00:35:27,883 --> 00:35:33,741
But swift as dreams, myself I found
Within the Pilot's boat.

380
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:39,033
Upon the whirl, where sank the ship,

381
00:35:39,408 --> 00:35:43,390
The boat spun round and round;

382
00:35:44,032 --> 00:35:46,155
And all was still,

383
00:35:47,883 --> 00:35:52,011
save that the hill
Was telling of the sound.

384
00:35:53,230 --> 00:35:58,613
I moved my lips—the Pilot shrieked
And fell down in a fit;

385
00:35:59,491 --> 00:36:03,943
The holy Hermit raised his eyes,
And prayed where he did sit.

386
00:36:05,389 --> 00:36:10,147
I took the oars: the Pilot's boy,
Who now doth crazy go,

387
00:36:10,194 --> 00:36:15,100
Laughed loud and long, and all the while
His eyes went to and fro.

388
00:36:15,569 --> 00:36:21,217
"Ha! ha!" quoth he, "full plain I see,
The Devil knows how to row."

389
00:36:23,335 --> 00:36:27,170
And now, all in my own country,

390
00:36:28,038 --> 00:36:30,201
I stood on the firm land!

391
00:36:31,436 --> 00:36:34,920
The Hermit stepped forth from the boat,
And scarcely he could stand.

392
00:36:35,163 --> 00:36:40,475
"O shrieve me, shrieve me, holy man!"

393
00:36:42,225 --> 00:36:46,772
The Hermit crossed his brow.
"Say quick," quoth he, "I bid thee say—

394
00:36:47,764 --> 00:36:50,397
What manner of man art thou?"

395
00:36:51,897 --> 00:36:55,233
Forthwith this frame of mine was wrenched
With a woeful agony,

396
00:36:55,335 --> 00:36:58,795
Which forced me to begin my tale;
And then it left me free.

397
00:36:59,485 --> 00:37:03,975
Since then, at an uncertain hour,
That agony returns;

398
00:37:04,030 --> 00:37:08,928
And till my ghastly tale is told,
This heart within me burns.

399
00:37:10,424 --> 00:37:15,569
I pass, like night, from land to land;
I have strange power of speech;

400
00:37:16,296 --> 00:37:20,678
That moment that his face I see,
I know the man that must hear me:

401
00:37:21,647 --> 00:37:24,780
To him my tale I teach.

402
00:37:26,788 --> 00:37:32,655
What loud uproar bursts from that door!
The wedding-guests are there:

403
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:37,897
But in the garden-bower the bride
And bride-maids singing are:

404
00:37:38,826 --> 00:37:44,655
And hark the little vesper bell,
Which biddeth me to prayer!

405
00:37:46,701 --> 00:37:51,881
O Wedding-Guest! this soul hath been

406
00:37:52,374 --> 00:37:57,639
Alone on a wide wide sea:

407
00:37:59,655 --> 00:38:04,139
So lonely 'twas, that God himself

408
00:38:05,233 --> 00:38:08,116
Scarce seemed there to be.

409
00:38:09,491 --> 00:38:13,135
O sweeter than the marriage-feast,

410
00:38:13,748 --> 00:38:15,905
'Tis sweeter far to me,

411
00:38:15,936 --> 00:38:19,412
To walk together to the kirk
With a goodly company!—

412
00:38:19,546 --> 00:38:23,076
To walk together to the kirk,
And all together pray,

413
00:38:24,405 --> 00:38:27,280
While each to his great Father bends,

414
00:38:28,014 --> 00:38:32,194
Old men, and babes, and loving friends,

415
00:38:32,444 --> 00:38:35,686
And youths and maidens gay!

416
00:38:37,069 --> 00:38:41,366
Farewell, farewell! but this I tell
To thee, thou Wedding-Guest!

417
00:38:42,585 --> 00:38:46,604
He prayeth well, who loveth well

418
00:38:46,708 --> 00:38:50,684
Both man and bird and beast.

419
00:38:51,997 --> 00:38:56,630
He prayeth best, who loveth best

420
00:38:56,693 --> 00:38:59,794
All things both great and small;

421
00:39:00,779 --> 00:39:05,692
For the dear God who loveth us
He made and loveth all.

422
00:39:07,372 --> 00:39:12,512
The Mariner, whose eye is bright,
Whose beard with age is hoar... is gone:

423
00:39:14,333 --> 00:39:18,528
and now the Wedding-Guest
Turned from the bridegroom's door.

424
00:39:20,044 --> 00:39:23,106
He went like one that hath been stunned,

425
00:39:23,997 --> 00:39:26,472
And is of sense forlorn:

426
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:32,973
A sadder and a wiser man,
He rose the morrow morn.

427
