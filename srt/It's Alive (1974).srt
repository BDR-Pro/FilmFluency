1
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,411
Honey?

2
00:02:16,335 --> 00:02:19,005
- Frank?
- What's the matter, he kicking again?

3
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:21,705
No, it's time.

4
00:02:31,474 --> 00:02:33,799
You always make me feel so...

5
00:02:34,018 --> 00:02:35,393
Frank!

6
00:02:37,897 --> 00:02:42,143
- You're awful.
- All right, let's get ready, huh?

7
00:02:56,497 --> 00:02:57,872
Frank?

8
00:03:04,754 --> 00:03:09,297
Oh, honey,
you better go wake up Chris.

9
00:03:14,346 --> 00:03:15,840
Chris.

10
00:03:36,324 --> 00:03:39,574
Come on, I got your number.

11
00:03:39,744 --> 00:03:41,072
Come on.

12
00:03:41,245 --> 00:03:42,870
Thattaboy.

13
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:46,075
- Dad, what time is it?
- What time is it? Time to get up.

14
00:03:46,375 --> 00:03:50,704
I have to drop you off at Charley's house.
You have to go to school from there.

15
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:52,421
- Why?
- Well, I wonder why.

16
00:03:52,589 --> 00:03:54,416
- I don't know.
- "I don't know."

17
00:03:54,591 --> 00:03:59,087
- Oh, is Mom having the baby?
- Yes. A trick she does every 11 years.

18
00:03:59,262 --> 00:04:01,835
- I guess so.
- Why don't you get dressed...

19
00:04:02,014 --> 00:04:04,422
...and don't forget your books.
- Okay.

20
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,094
- Dad?
- Yeah?

21
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:10,390
Anything happen to her? I saw on TV
in a movie once, where the mother died.

22
00:04:10,605 --> 00:04:12,562
Well, you know something?

23
00:04:13,066 --> 00:04:16,399
Things like that
happened a long time ago.

24
00:04:16,569 --> 00:04:19,938
They don't happen that way anymore.
She had you, didn't she?

25
00:04:20,114 --> 00:04:22,521
Yeah, look at the size of you,
you big ox.

26
00:04:24,493 --> 00:04:29,949
Okay, now, here you go.
Let's get ready. Attaboy.

27
00:04:47,555 --> 00:04:49,880
Why can't I go with you
to the hospital?

28
00:04:50,266 --> 00:04:55,093
We'd love to have you, but the doctors
don't allow little boys in hospitals.

29
00:04:55,271 --> 00:04:57,512
If I have my tonsils out again
I can go there.

30
00:04:57,731 --> 00:05:00,981
You'd be there for a week
and we'd be home in three days.

31
00:05:01,151 --> 00:05:05,480
You young whippersnappers.
You're not like the old team.

32
00:05:05,697 --> 00:05:09,646
Out with old Mr. Dunson, out on the
plains and prairie, driving those cattle...

33
00:05:09,826 --> 00:05:13,443
...getting their tonsils out in the middle
of the night, no doctors.

34
00:05:13,621 --> 00:05:17,488
Oh, boy. You're not a chip off
the old block there, scout.

35
00:05:18,834 --> 00:05:21,503
Well, maybe Charley
won't like having me around.

36
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:24,160
Charley won't like having you around.

37
00:05:24,339 --> 00:05:28,917
Charley only sees his own boys two
Sundays a month and he loves kids.

38
00:05:29,093 --> 00:05:34,335
Now, you young whippersnapper,
kiss your mother goodbye.

39
00:05:34,515 --> 00:05:37,599
Listen, we'll give you a call
as soon as we find out...

40
00:05:37,767 --> 00:05:40,437
...whether you've got
a baby sister or a brother.

41
00:05:40,603 --> 00:05:44,435
I don't care, as long as you're okay.
And you give me one of the puppies.

42
00:05:47,026 --> 00:05:49,018
Charley!

43
00:05:55,825 --> 00:05:58,032
Honey, your book.

44
00:05:58,203 --> 00:06:00,954
- Hi, Charley!
- Okay, Lenore, good luck to you.

45
00:06:01,122 --> 00:06:04,455
Call me, Frank. Call me.

46
00:06:10,297 --> 00:06:13,463
Well, pal, let's go and whip up
some French toast.

47
00:06:24,852 --> 00:06:27,389
I'm having my baby.

48
00:06:44,703 --> 00:06:47,407
Nurse, you know what they call them?

49
00:06:47,622 --> 00:06:52,829
In Ireland, my mother used to call them
the "wee cuddies" and the "wee cubs."

50
00:06:53,002 --> 00:06:55,754
The wee cuddies and wee...
Where could you get that?

51
00:06:55,963 --> 00:06:58,668
Wee cuddies and wee cubs.
I hope I have one like that.

52
00:06:58,882 --> 00:07:03,211
Would you please come to the labor
room now? It's the time to go back.

53
00:07:03,386 --> 00:07:04,715
- The labor room?
- Yes.

54
00:07:04,888 --> 00:07:06,382
- All right.
- This way.

55
00:07:14,396 --> 00:07:17,931
How did you know about
the wee cuddies and the wee cubs?

56
00:07:18,108 --> 00:07:20,184
I learned about them a long time ago.

57
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:23,314
- You speak Gaelic? Are you Irish?
- Yes. No, Scottish.

58
00:07:23,488 --> 00:07:25,694
- Scottish? And you speak Gaelic?
- I do.

59
00:07:25,865 --> 00:07:27,822
- You do speak Gaelic?
- This way.

60
00:07:27,992 --> 00:07:31,112
An Irish and a Gaelic.
An Irish and a Scotsman.

61
00:07:35,374 --> 00:07:37,496
- An Irish and a Scotsman.
- Yes.

62
00:07:43,464 --> 00:07:44,793
Hang on to my hand.

63
00:07:44,966 --> 00:07:48,500
Honey, I'm not very brave.
Oh, this little guy's gonna kill me.

64
00:07:49,762 --> 00:07:52,335
- Well, maybe I'll get a doctor.
- No, no.

65
00:07:52,514 --> 00:07:54,590
He's just different than Chris,
that's all.

66
00:07:54,766 --> 00:07:57,802
I tried to talk to the doctor
and make him understand...

67
00:07:57,977 --> 00:08:00,053
...but I couldn't make him understand.

68
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:04,274
It seems like it's different.
Honey, you better get the nurse.

69
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:06,897
Nurse, hurry up, please.

70
00:08:08,153 --> 00:08:12,862
- You better go to the waiting room.
- Just a minute, please. I love you.

71
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:17,449
I'm glad. I'm glad we decided to
have the baby, aren't you?

72
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:19,945
We both want it.
Don't worry about a thing.

73
00:08:20,122 --> 00:08:23,159
It's not gonna tie you down,
is it, sweetheart?

74
00:08:23,375 --> 00:08:26,162
Are you gonna feel trapped
like you did last time?

75
00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:30,750
- Calm down. Take a deep breath.
- I can't!

76
00:08:30,924 --> 00:08:34,127
Take a deep breath. Calm down.

77
00:08:34,302 --> 00:08:38,548
Relax. Try to relax.
Take a deep breath.

78
00:08:39,015 --> 00:08:42,597
Hey, listen, have you got something
to stir the coffee with?

79
00:08:42,768 --> 00:08:46,350
Yeah, here, use that. I've been using it
for the past three hours.

80
00:08:46,521 --> 00:08:48,893
You get used
to the taste of lead in coffee.

81
00:08:49,274 --> 00:08:52,939
There is an overabundance of lead
in all the things we eat nowadays.

82
00:08:53,111 --> 00:08:55,648
We're slowly but surely
poisoning ourselves.

83
00:08:56,238 --> 00:08:58,776
Fine world to bring a kid into, fellas.

84
00:08:58,949 --> 00:09:01,784
- I could cite examples...
- You don't have to lecture.

85
00:09:01,952 --> 00:09:05,036
Take a look at that smog.
What difference does it make...

86
00:09:05,205 --> 00:09:08,241
...if we breathe it or eat it?
- Maybe we'll adapt to it.

87
00:09:08,416 --> 00:09:11,999
I'm an exterminator. We service
the Beverly Hills-Westwood area.

88
00:09:12,211 --> 00:09:14,369
Here. Here's my card.

89
00:09:15,548 --> 00:09:18,632
I'm not trying to drum up business
or anything. No.

90
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:22,668
The point is, years back, we developed
this spray to kill roaches...

91
00:09:22,888 --> 00:09:24,512
...and other household pests.

92
00:09:24,681 --> 00:09:28,180
Well, all we ended up doing
was creating a new breed of roaches.

93
00:09:28,351 --> 00:09:32,597
- Is that right?
- Bigger, stronger and harder to kill.

94
00:09:35,983 --> 00:09:38,734
You wanna play poker?
Five-card draw.

95
00:09:39,069 --> 00:09:41,275
- Come on.
- Might as well.

96
00:09:41,446 --> 00:09:44,233
Let's clear some of this stuff away
and get going.

97
00:09:46,492 --> 00:09:49,777
I just hope my wife isn't gonna have
any trouble, you know?

98
00:09:49,995 --> 00:09:52,237
She did the last baby in 45 minutes.

99
00:09:52,456 --> 00:09:54,365
- No kidding.
- That's a fact.

100
00:09:56,626 --> 00:09:59,829
I thought they said
the second one came faster.

101
00:10:00,296 --> 00:10:04,590
You got nothing to complain about.
My wife's been in labor for six hours.

102
00:10:19,647 --> 00:10:22,055
Son of a bitch of a thing
stole my 50 cents!

103
00:10:28,447 --> 00:10:30,404
Hey, hold it.

104
00:10:31,616 --> 00:10:36,657
Here's your 50 cents.
No, really. No, no. Here's 50 cents.

105
00:10:37,288 --> 00:10:42,199
Go on. Sit down and read a magazine
or something.

106
00:10:45,128 --> 00:10:47,963
You know what's the biggest problem
in Beverly Hills?

107
00:10:48,131 --> 00:10:51,666
Snails. Yeah, snails and slugs.

108
00:10:52,552 --> 00:10:54,959
They can wipe out a lawn
in just a few weeks.

109
00:10:55,346 --> 00:10:57,303
Folks feel sorry for them.

110
00:10:57,473 --> 00:11:00,474
They're not like
your usual pest, you know?

111
00:11:00,642 --> 00:11:04,854
Folks just hate to see all them snails
laying on their lawns, dead.

112
00:11:05,564 --> 00:11:08,351
Snails and slugs and bugs.

113
00:11:09,317 --> 00:11:12,234
Any of you guys
in a happier profession?

114
00:11:41,179 --> 00:11:44,014
I think we've got
a really effective anesthetic.

115
00:11:44,182 --> 00:11:47,800
We'll check you before
we really do anything.

116
00:11:47,977 --> 00:11:52,722
- You know, I hurt...
- But you're doing just great. Just relax.

117
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:57,474
- It's been different than...
- You've done your share, we'll do ours.

118
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:07,618
She's fully dilated.
The head's on the perineum.

119
00:12:13,417 --> 00:12:16,832
- I know something's wrong.
- It's nothing really wrong, honey...

120
00:12:17,003 --> 00:12:19,494
...it's just a very, very big baby.

121
00:12:19,881 --> 00:12:23,960
- Gonna be fine, but I need your help.
- I know something's wrong.

122
00:12:24,135 --> 00:12:27,301
How big was your last baby?
How big, did you say?

123
00:12:27,471 --> 00:12:31,717
Seven pounds, 4 ounces. I told you
that this baby was different than Chris.

124
00:12:31,892 --> 00:12:33,967
This baby is just gigantic.

125
00:12:34,144 --> 00:12:38,521
It's probably 10, 101/2,
maybe even 11 pounds.

126
00:12:38,689 --> 00:12:41,809
Got a gigantic head,
but she's got a big pelvis.

127
00:12:42,026 --> 00:12:44,267
And she's got plenty of relaxation.

128
00:12:44,445 --> 00:12:46,733
I'm trying to cooperate.

129
00:12:46,905 --> 00:12:50,274
All right, all right. Relax. Relax.

130
00:12:51,284 --> 00:12:53,442
This thing is just immense.

131
00:12:53,786 --> 00:12:59,160
Now, we're just putting forceps
on the baby's head. Just breathe deep.

132
00:13:00,459 --> 00:13:06,248
Don't push, just pant.
Now, we're just easing the baby out.

133
00:13:06,673 --> 00:13:09,508
- Something's wrong.
- All right.

134
00:13:10,927 --> 00:13:13,762
Now, we just cut you.
You didn't feel that, did you?

135
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:15,305
- No.
- Okay, fine.

136
00:13:15,473 --> 00:13:18,557
Now, the baby will be out
in just about 30 seconds.

137
00:13:48,169 --> 00:13:51,086
Davis! Davis! Wait!

138
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:21,113
What does my baby look like?!
What's wrong with my baby?!

139
00:14:21,449 --> 00:14:22,694
Doctor!

140
00:14:22,867 --> 00:14:25,702
- Doctor!
- Davis, out of here!

141
00:14:31,416 --> 00:14:35,496
The umbilical cord's been severed.
Looks like it's been chewed off.

142
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:37,876
Where's the baby?!
The baby, doctor!

143
00:14:38,089 --> 00:14:40,758
- Get off of me!
- Get your hands off me!

144
00:14:48,307 --> 00:14:50,346
Darling!

145
00:14:55,396 --> 00:14:58,183
- Lenore! Lenore!
- Come on, let's go!

146
00:15:00,192 --> 00:15:03,359
Let me go! Let me go!

147
00:15:07,491 --> 00:15:09,946
Let go of me!

148
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,244
- We're gonna calm you down.
- Let me go! My wife!

149
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:16,914
Who stole my baby, doctor?

150
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:26,671
Don't. Don't touch me.
Don't you touch me.

151
00:15:27,634 --> 00:15:30,255
They stole my baby.

152
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:36,342
Frank!
I don't want my baby to be dead!

153
00:15:36,558 --> 00:15:41,765
I don't...
Tell me my baby isn't dead, please.

154
00:15:41,938 --> 00:15:45,224
I assure you, Mrs. Davis,
your baby is very much alive.

155
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:49,350
Oh, thank you. Thank you.

156
00:15:53,365 --> 00:15:56,070
Located a broken skylight
on the third floor.

157
00:15:56,243 --> 00:15:59,113
Blood and excess tissue on the roof.

158
00:16:03,499 --> 00:16:06,536
Lieutenant, what's it look like to you?

159
00:16:11,507 --> 00:16:13,380
Something small.

160
00:16:48,123 --> 00:16:50,246
Doctor.

161
00:16:52,043 --> 00:16:54,878
She's coming out of sedation now.

162
00:17:00,551 --> 00:17:02,093
Lenore?

163
00:17:07,265 --> 00:17:08,676
Can you hear me, darling?

164
00:17:09,184 --> 00:17:13,810
Somebody might have abducted our baby
and I'm holding this hospital responsible.

165
00:17:14,022 --> 00:17:18,564
That hole in the skylight isn't large
enough for a full-sized human being.

166
00:17:18,734 --> 00:17:21,225
There's no other way out
of that delivery room.

167
00:17:21,403 --> 00:17:24,772
- The doctor's correct.
- Let's not have a discussion about it.

168
00:17:24,948 --> 00:17:27,949
I've asked your husband
to submit to some tests.

169
00:17:28,159 --> 00:17:29,737
And I've refused.

170
00:17:30,286 --> 00:17:34,864
You've never been exposed to
radioactivity and radioactive material...

171
00:17:35,041 --> 00:17:38,954
...or undergone extensive x-rays?
- No, doctor, I told you.

172
00:17:39,128 --> 00:17:42,662
Well, we can't rule out genetic damage.

173
00:17:42,839 --> 00:17:46,006
I notice you did inquire
about abortion eight months ago.

174
00:17:46,176 --> 00:17:50,552
Doesn't everybody inquire about it now?
It was just a question of convenience.

175
00:17:50,721 --> 00:17:54,220
- We decided to have the baby.
- We all make mistakes.

176
00:17:54,391 --> 00:17:58,471
I apologize for that crack.
Let me talk to you outside. Come on.

177
00:18:22,208 --> 00:18:24,331
You're not afraid of me, are you?

178
00:18:24,502 --> 00:18:28,582
I've always been afraid of you.
Especially those eyes.

179
00:18:33,885 --> 00:18:35,794
I wanted a boy so badly.

180
00:18:37,597 --> 00:18:42,839
I think he was probably very frightened.
I know he's different.

181
00:18:43,019 --> 00:18:45,688
Yeah, I just...

182
00:18:45,854 --> 00:18:49,437
I think he was probably afraid
they were gonna hurt him.

183
00:18:56,489 --> 00:18:58,944
He's not ugly.

184
00:19:04,872 --> 00:19:08,038
Oh, you're so exhausted, sweetheart.

185
00:19:09,459 --> 00:19:12,164
You don't know what you're saying.

186
00:19:12,795 --> 00:19:14,705
I'm gonna check up on those two.

187
00:19:15,882 --> 00:19:17,921
I don't trust them.

188
00:19:19,885 --> 00:19:22,376
I mean, can you imagine?

189
00:19:23,055 --> 00:19:26,673
Can you imagine those guys,
trying to blame us?

190
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:28,510
We are the parents, sweetheart.

191
00:19:41,488 --> 00:19:45,616
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

192
00:19:50,872 --> 00:19:53,197
Doctor Norton decided
your wife can go home.

193
00:19:53,374 --> 00:19:55,865
- First thing in the morning.
- You realize...

194
00:19:56,043 --> 00:19:59,791
...it's in everyone's interest
to keep this quiet for the time being...

195
00:19:59,963 --> 00:20:03,332
...at least until we can find out
what's become of the infant.

196
00:20:03,508 --> 00:20:06,425
- You have heard no word about it?
- No.

197
00:20:06,594 --> 00:20:10,259
I don't see how it could survive
without clothing and nourishment.

198
00:20:10,431 --> 00:20:15,970
- Of course, like any animal, it may be...
- Well, it's not an animal, doctor...

199
00:20:16,144 --> 00:20:18,137
...you know that very well.

200
00:20:18,355 --> 00:20:22,304
Whatever it is,
you can't classify it as an animal.

201
00:20:22,483 --> 00:20:26,433
It's human, doctor, and that's
what's disgusting to you, isn't it?

202
00:20:26,612 --> 00:20:28,237
It kills like an animal.

203
00:20:28,405 --> 00:20:32,984
And when we find it,
we're gonna have to destroy it like one.

204
00:20:34,327 --> 00:20:36,534
Well, I don't care.

205
00:20:36,705 --> 00:20:38,946
I suppose you have
to do what's necessary.

206
00:20:39,123 --> 00:20:40,915
I'm glad you feel that way.

207
00:20:41,084 --> 00:20:44,452
I only hope your wife
understands as well.

208
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:48,706
What's there to understand?

209
00:20:50,092 --> 00:20:53,792
- Better not to think about it.
- Hey, look...

210
00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:58,383
...why not say good night to your
wife and maybe I drive you home.

211
00:20:58,558 --> 00:21:00,515
No, thanks.

212
00:21:03,354 --> 00:21:07,849
Okay, darling,
I'll see you in the morning.

213
00:21:21,328 --> 00:21:23,285
Stay on duty.

214
00:22:55,705 --> 00:22:58,908
<i>Police still offer no explanation</i>
<i>in the five deaths...</i>

215
00:22:59,083 --> 00:23:02,534
<i>... which occurred early today</i>
<i>at Saint George Medical Center.</i>

216
00:23:02,712 --> 00:23:05,167
<i>Officers are still working</i>
<i>around the clock.</i>

217
00:23:05,339 --> 00:23:08,174
<i>Sources at the hospital alleged</i>
<i>the deaths resulted...</i>

218
00:23:08,342 --> 00:23:11,959
<i>... from attacks by an infant</i>
<i>born only today in a mutated form...</i>

219
00:23:12,137 --> 00:23:13,963
<i>... but officials declined comment.</i>

220
00:23:14,139 --> 00:23:17,887
<i>This station has acquired information</i>
<i>naming Mr. And Mrs. Frank Davis...</i>

221
00:23:18,059 --> 00:23:21,593
<i>... of West Los Angeles as the parents</i>
<i>of the infant in question.</i>

222
00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:25,186
<i>The whereabouts of the newborn child</i>
<i>are not known.</i>

223
00:23:25,357 --> 00:23:29,817
They named us.
The bastards, they named us.

224
00:26:35,404 --> 00:26:38,191
Barbara, would you
come here for a minute, please?

225
00:26:38,365 --> 00:26:40,238
- Yes?
- I have to pick up my wife...

226
00:26:40,408 --> 00:26:44,240
...at the hospital tonight. Reschedule
the Sturbridge dinner for tomorrow.

227
00:26:44,412 --> 00:26:48,623
- I think Mr. Clayton wants to talk to you.
- And about the Marcus affair...

228
00:26:49,375 --> 00:26:54,285
...I think we can have cocktails at 6:30
tomorrow. I know he wants to approve...

229
00:26:54,463 --> 00:26:59,171
...the campaign by the end of the week.
- I think you better see Mr. Clayton now.

230
00:26:59,717 --> 00:27:01,046
All right.

231
00:27:01,803 --> 00:27:03,878
I'll be right back.

232
00:27:14,522 --> 00:27:17,357
- Well, well, come on in.
- Hello, pal.

233
00:27:17,567 --> 00:27:19,808
You must be exhausted.
You eaten anything?

234
00:27:19,986 --> 00:27:23,354
Get Frank a couple of poached eggs
on an English muffin...

235
00:27:23,531 --> 00:27:27,279
...with a side of bacon
and a tall glass of fresh orange juice.

236
00:27:27,492 --> 00:27:30,197
Should do the trick.
Don't want you collapsing.

237
00:27:30,370 --> 00:27:32,991
Frank, don't let it get you down.

238
00:27:33,164 --> 00:27:36,331
These things happen,
or at least that's what they say.

239
00:27:36,501 --> 00:27:38,742
- Who's they?
- I spoke to the hospital.

240
00:27:38,961 --> 00:27:40,372
They give you information?

241
00:27:40,546 --> 00:27:43,119
Well, I got connections over there,
you know.

242
00:27:43,298 --> 00:27:47,841
I'm the vice-chairman of the fundraising
committee. If there's anything I can do...

243
00:27:48,011 --> 00:27:50,716
No. Thanks.
I'm getting her out of there tonight.

244
00:27:52,056 --> 00:27:53,432
You think that's wise?

245
00:27:57,478 --> 00:28:00,395
Say, Barbara told me
you want to rap with me.

246
00:28:01,064 --> 00:28:02,938
Yeah, Frank.

247
00:28:05,569 --> 00:28:07,691
Frank, you...

248
00:28:08,238 --> 00:28:12,187
- You've accrued three weeks vacation.
- Yeah.

249
00:28:12,366 --> 00:28:16,446
You think it'd be a good idea
if you took it now?

250
00:28:17,121 --> 00:28:21,450
I can't, Bob.
I mean, I got the Marcus account...

251
00:28:21,625 --> 00:28:26,085
...and the Sturbridge campaign.
I'm just bogged down in work.

252
00:28:26,254 --> 00:28:30,631
Besides, I need to work.
It keeps my mind off things.

253
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:33,753
Frank, we're running
a public-relations business here.

254
00:28:33,927 --> 00:28:38,968
Our job is creating an image. And right
now, well, you're a little controversial.

255
00:28:40,058 --> 00:28:42,845
See, our clients want
their PR men to be anonymous.

256
00:28:43,061 --> 00:28:47,639
Maybe after a little while,
when you're a little less of a celebrity.

257
00:28:51,485 --> 00:28:55,399
You're not taking those accounts
away from me, are you?

258
00:28:55,572 --> 00:28:59,023
I mean, not now. Last-minute?

259
00:28:59,409 --> 00:29:02,575
These things happen, Frank.

260
00:29:02,745 --> 00:29:07,074
Look, you know O'Connors down
in accounting? He's got a retarded kid.

261
00:29:07,416 --> 00:29:11,663
Insists on keeping him in the house too.
Well, nobody thinks a thing of that.

262
00:29:11,837 --> 00:29:13,913
Nobody blames him.

263
00:29:14,881 --> 00:29:20,551
We're not talking about a retarded kid
and you know it.

264
00:29:21,345 --> 00:29:25,010
We're talking about
a monstrosity of some kind.

265
00:29:25,641 --> 00:29:29,508
Yeah, well, maybe we better
not talk about that.

266
00:29:44,241 --> 00:29:45,783
Bob.

267
00:29:48,662 --> 00:29:51,283
I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy.

268
00:29:52,999 --> 00:29:54,991
Just that I...

269
00:29:55,168 --> 00:29:59,461
I don't know what to do, Bob.
How to behave.

270
00:29:59,797 --> 00:30:01,919
And they...

271
00:30:03,592 --> 00:30:08,088
Putting microphones in my face. They're
asking me questions I don't understand.

272
00:30:08,304 --> 00:30:11,258
You know, what you need
is a good public-relations firm...

273
00:30:11,432 --> 00:30:13,590
...to handle all of that for you.

274
00:30:21,983 --> 00:30:24,474
That's very funny.

275
00:30:26,237 --> 00:30:27,945
Bob...

276
00:30:30,032 --> 00:30:32,737
Bob, this is all gonna be all right,
isn't it?

277
00:30:32,910 --> 00:30:36,076
When whatever this thing is
is dead. Right?

278
00:30:37,206 --> 00:30:38,534
Maybe it already is.

279
00:30:39,583 --> 00:30:43,532
Look, Frank, why don't you go down
the service elevator...

280
00:30:43,711 --> 00:30:46,629
...you won't have to meet
all those media people.

281
00:30:47,548 --> 00:30:49,873
Bob...

282
00:30:58,225 --> 00:31:00,264
Take care.

283
00:31:13,697 --> 00:31:19,035
Have them empty out his desk.
Send his personal articles to his house.

284
00:31:19,202 --> 00:31:20,577
He won't be coming back.

285
00:31:22,747 --> 00:31:25,913
- Mr. Davis, what did it look like?
- I got nothing to say.

286
00:31:26,083 --> 00:31:28,574
- What are you afraid of?
- Get out of my face.

287
00:31:28,752 --> 00:31:30,579
I got no comment.

288
00:31:30,754 --> 00:31:34,205
Get that goddamn thing out of my face!
Get out of the way!

289
00:31:34,382 --> 00:31:36,624
- What did it look like?
- I don't know.

290
00:31:36,801 --> 00:31:40,134
Never mind my baby!
Leave my wife out of it, you understand?

291
00:31:45,851 --> 00:31:47,724
Aren't we almost home?

292
00:31:50,063 --> 00:31:52,221
We'll be there in a few minutes.

293
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:58,563
I feel better already,
getting out of that terrible place.

294
00:31:58,738 --> 00:32:02,320
I don't have to take more shots, do I?
I don't like taking shots.

295
00:32:02,491 --> 00:32:08,196
- I don't like being made to go to sleep.
- Well, I engaged nurses in three shifts.

296
00:32:08,705 --> 00:32:11,575
I'm surprised anybody
would even wanna work for us.

297
00:32:14,835 --> 00:32:18,536
- Well, Dr. Norton took care of it.
- Oh, good.

298
00:32:19,506 --> 00:32:22,756
And I'm gonna be there all the time.

299
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:25,418
- What about...
- Yeah, I told the office...

300
00:32:25,595 --> 00:32:28,596
...I have to have those three weeks
vacation they owe me.

301
00:32:28,765 --> 00:32:34,185
Oh, what about that Marcus account?
That was very important to you.

302
00:32:34,353 --> 00:32:35,633
You're more important.

303
00:32:35,813 --> 00:32:39,228
What about Chris? Have you told him?
Does he know anything?

304
00:32:39,399 --> 00:32:41,641
I spoke to Charley.

305
00:32:42,402 --> 00:32:46,898
He kept him home from school.
Hasn't told him anything.

306
00:32:47,073 --> 00:32:51,117
- Good.
- Sooner or later, he'll switch on the TV.

307
00:32:51,285 --> 00:32:53,823
It's only so long you can keep
a secret like that.

308
00:32:54,455 --> 00:32:57,704
Dad, why can't I go to school or go out
or have friends over?

309
00:32:58,166 --> 00:33:01,001
Chris, I can't tell you now, son.

310
00:33:01,169 --> 00:33:04,086
You'll have to trust me.
You do trust me, don't you?

311
00:33:04,255 --> 00:33:06,710
- Sure, Dad.
<i>- You have to spend all your time...</i>

312
00:33:06,924 --> 00:33:09,960
...with Charley this week.
You wouldn't mind that.

313
00:33:10,469 --> 00:33:14,383
Chris. Chris, hey, buddy,
you don't wanna hurt his feelings.

314
00:33:14,598 --> 00:33:17,634
I like Charley, but I wanna
see Mom and the baby.

315
00:33:17,809 --> 00:33:19,885
<i>- The baby's not home yet.</i>
- Is it sick?

316
00:33:20,645 --> 00:33:23,895
Yeah, that's right, son.
The baby's sick.

317
00:33:24,065 --> 00:33:28,525
And everything here's a mess.
So it would be much better...

318
00:33:28,694 --> 00:33:33,023
...if you stay where you are.
- You tell Charley to let me watch TV.

319
00:33:33,198 --> 00:33:36,115
<i>- Okay, put him on.</i>
- Okay.

320
00:33:40,288 --> 00:33:44,071
Okay, Frank. Look, we'll take care
of everything. Hey, I had an idea.

321
00:33:44,250 --> 00:33:46,621
I'll take Chris up to the lake
for fishing.

322
00:33:47,169 --> 00:33:48,960
Okay, Charley. Thank you.

323
00:33:49,171 --> 00:33:51,293
Oh, and give my love to Lenore.

324
00:33:51,881 --> 00:33:53,790
Thanks, Charley.

325
00:34:20,657 --> 00:34:24,108
Hunting and killing babies
doesn't seem to be my specialty.

326
00:34:24,286 --> 00:34:26,325
So, what do you want, a transfer?

327
00:34:26,496 --> 00:34:28,951
Well, my wife's in her eighth month.

328
00:34:29,123 --> 00:34:31,875
Since I started this,
she hasn't gotten any rest.

329
00:34:32,084 --> 00:34:35,038
Me being so involved
really brings it home.

330
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:39,250
Besides, I guess you know
we lost our last baby.

331
00:34:39,716 --> 00:34:42,634
Look, you're lucky you don't have
grown kids nowadays.

332
00:34:42,802 --> 00:34:46,669
People without children
don't realize how lucky they are.

333
00:34:47,557 --> 00:34:48,885
Take these.

334
00:34:52,186 --> 00:34:54,344
Make you feel much better.

335
00:35:02,487 --> 00:35:05,322
Did you see it, Mrs. Davis?

336
00:35:08,325 --> 00:35:10,614
Surely you must have gotten
one glimpse.

337
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,917
They say it has teeth and claws.
Did you know that?

338
00:35:20,336 --> 00:35:22,376
How should I know that?

339
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:28,300
Were you aware that it killed
another person just last night?

340
00:35:28,469 --> 00:35:32,798
A musician on Santa Monica Boulevard.
He was on his way home from work...

341
00:35:32,973 --> 00:35:35,049
...about 2 in the morning...

342
00:35:35,225 --> 00:35:37,550
...and that was the last anybody
saw of him.

343
00:35:37,727 --> 00:35:40,016
They found him in an alley.

344
00:35:41,522 --> 00:35:44,642
Well, they can't be sure that it was...

345
00:35:45,234 --> 00:35:47,191
There's no doubt about it.

346
00:35:47,361 --> 00:35:50,694
The wounds are the same
as the doctor and nurses suffered.

347
00:35:55,994 --> 00:35:57,369
Well...

348
00:35:59,121 --> 00:36:03,450
- Well, what do you want me to say?
- Just say anything you feel.

349
00:36:08,755 --> 00:36:12,835
- What's under that napkin?
- There's nothing there.

350
00:36:13,718 --> 00:36:16,339
A recorder! A tape recorder!

351
00:36:16,554 --> 00:36:18,795
I'm a nurse. You can tell me anything.

352
00:36:18,973 --> 00:36:22,637
- Who are you working for?
- I really am a registered nurse...

353
00:36:22,809 --> 00:36:25,300
...and I write a little on the side.

354
00:36:25,479 --> 00:36:28,764
She's taking interviews
on a tape recorder.

355
00:36:40,701 --> 00:36:42,859
Get out.

356
00:37:00,594 --> 00:37:02,218
Frank?

357
00:37:09,101 --> 00:37:11,343
We just have to get rid
of everybody.

358
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:15,138
- Let's not have any more nurses, honey.
- All right.

359
00:37:15,357 --> 00:37:18,026
We'll let them all go.

360
00:37:24,115 --> 00:37:26,866
Should have known better...

361
00:37:28,035 --> 00:37:30,989
...than to trust anybody.

362
00:41:10,778 --> 00:41:14,906
Actually, already in excess
of $ 100,000 has been allocated...

363
00:41:15,115 --> 00:41:19,943
...by the university for examination
of this phenomenon.

364
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:22,575
We have some of the leading men
in the field.

365
00:41:22,747 --> 00:41:26,791
It's hoped this might lead to a
breakthrough to a better understanding...

366
00:41:26,959 --> 00:41:29,415
...of why mutations occur.

367
00:41:32,214 --> 00:41:34,171
You wanna experiment on it?

368
00:41:34,383 --> 00:41:38,629
My department has already cautioned
the police about excessive violence.

369
00:41:38,803 --> 00:41:43,132
If it could be dispatched with a bullet or,
better still, some kind of a gas.

370
00:41:43,349 --> 00:41:47,596
Undoubtedly, it's small and any kind of
bodily harm, especially from gunshots...

371
00:41:47,770 --> 00:41:50,770
...or explosives...
- In other words, you want me...

372
00:41:50,939 --> 00:41:52,350
...to sign away the body?

373
00:41:52,566 --> 00:41:56,184
Well, it's your right. After all,
you are the child's father.

374
00:41:57,529 --> 00:41:59,486
It's not my child.

375
00:41:59,697 --> 00:42:01,820
That's very wise...

376
00:42:01,991 --> 00:42:04,778
...to disassociate yourself emotionally.

377
00:42:06,495 --> 00:42:10,362
Just sign each copy, please.

378
00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:11,916
- Pen?
- Give him a pen.

379
00:42:21,509 --> 00:42:26,217
You know, it seems that out of every
tragedy, out of every evil...

380
00:42:26,388 --> 00:42:29,922
...some good can come if we
only apply ourselves.

381
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:33,764
I suppose that's gonna be in all
the medical journals?

382
00:42:33,978 --> 00:42:35,472
History books?

383
00:42:36,147 --> 00:42:39,397
"The Davis child."
"The Davis monster."

384
00:42:41,402 --> 00:42:43,727
It's like Frankenstein.

385
00:42:45,030 --> 00:42:49,857
In my opinion, this will be remembered
long after each of us is forgotten.

386
00:42:50,076 --> 00:42:53,030
When I was a kid, I always thought...

387
00:42:53,204 --> 00:42:57,996
...the monster was Frankenstein. Karloff
walking around in big shoes, grunting.

388
00:42:58,167 --> 00:43:00,788
I thought he was Frankenstein.

389
00:43:01,878 --> 00:43:04,416
Then I went to high school
and read the book...

390
00:43:04,631 --> 00:43:09,791
...and I realized that Frankenstein
was the...

391
00:43:10,344 --> 00:43:12,965
...doctor who created him.

392
00:43:13,764 --> 00:43:16,337
Somehow the identities...

393
00:43:17,726 --> 00:43:20,264
...get all mixed up, don't they?

394
00:43:24,357 --> 00:43:29,647
One must not allow oneself
to be impressed by escapist fiction.

395
00:43:29,820 --> 00:43:32,311
You forgot one.

396
00:43:32,781 --> 00:43:34,275
Pen.

397
00:43:43,750 --> 00:43:45,078
Frank, darling?

398
00:43:51,298 --> 00:43:53,172
Hi, darling.

399
00:43:53,342 --> 00:43:57,006
Mrs. Davis, I don't suppose you
took the pills I gave you.

400
00:43:57,220 --> 00:43:59,509
You really should, you know.

401
00:43:59,681 --> 00:44:03,808
Maybe it's all the pills I've taken
over the years that brought this on.

402
00:44:06,103 --> 00:44:08,392
You really shouldn't be downstairs.

403
00:44:09,273 --> 00:44:12,641
Maybe you'd both like
to have dinner with us.

404
00:44:12,859 --> 00:44:15,528
I have wonderful lamb chops
in the refrigerator.

405
00:44:15,737 --> 00:44:17,646
No, I'm afraid not.

406
00:44:18,990 --> 00:44:22,773
Honey, why don't you go down
to the basement and get a bottle...

407
00:44:22,952 --> 00:44:26,819
...of that nice Beaujolais. Won't that
go nicely with the lamb chops?

408
00:44:28,749 --> 00:44:31,418
We have quite an extensive wine cellar.

409
00:44:31,584 --> 00:44:35,712
It's one of Frank's many hobbies.
My husband's a many-faceted man.

410
00:44:37,965 --> 00:44:40,207
I'll show these gentlemen to the door.

411
00:45:00,694 --> 00:45:03,232
I'll get that wine.

412
00:45:03,405 --> 00:45:06,405
Oh, great, great. Good. Good.

413
00:46:12,801 --> 00:46:15,885
Boy, that basement's filthy.

414
00:46:18,681 --> 00:46:22,180
<i>How long had she taken birth control</i>
<i>pills before this pregnancy?</i>

415
00:46:22,393 --> 00:46:24,220
- Thirty-one months.
- You realize...

416
00:46:24,395 --> 00:46:27,348
...I came from the East
specifically for this matter.

417
00:46:27,522 --> 00:46:30,476
I realize that it is a police problem.

418
00:46:30,650 --> 00:46:34,398
But once the thing is killed,
it becomes a medical problem. Now...

419
00:46:34,571 --> 00:46:36,978
...you are in charge of that department?

420
00:46:37,156 --> 00:46:39,030
- Yes, I suppose so.
- Now...

421
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:41,655
...nobody knows how
this thing happened.

422
00:46:41,827 --> 00:46:45,741
It's really a matter of speculation
and perhaps that's for the best.

423
00:46:45,914 --> 00:46:51,074
After all, if we find out that the cause
is medication that we manufacture...

424
00:46:51,252 --> 00:46:54,253
...and it was administered over
a long period of time...

425
00:46:54,422 --> 00:46:58,502
...it'd be bad for you and worse for us.
We're susceptible to lawsuits.

426
00:46:58,676 --> 00:47:02,507
We'd think the government hadn't tested
and approved of those products...

427
00:47:02,679 --> 00:47:04,257
...that we put on the market.

428
00:47:04,431 --> 00:47:06,886
What do your interests recommend?

429
00:47:07,725 --> 00:47:12,019
Absolute destruction of this thing.

430
00:47:12,188 --> 00:47:16,351
Well, they've already signed over
the remains to the university.

431
00:47:16,525 --> 00:47:21,151
But if there was nothing left of it...

432
00:47:21,321 --> 00:47:24,820
...we would be most grateful to you.

433
00:47:26,784 --> 00:47:30,283
You have had
a very successful career...

434
00:47:30,454 --> 00:47:33,325
...until this freak incident.

435
00:47:34,416 --> 00:47:36,788
You know, it could
work out for the best.

436
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:42,381
We have an opening on the board of our
research and development department.

437
00:47:42,590 --> 00:47:45,959
Now, we wouldn't want people
to lose faith in us, would we?

438
00:49:00,703 --> 00:49:03,372
- Hello?
- <i>Dr. Norton, please</i>.

439
00:49:04,331 --> 00:49:07,830
No, Dr. Norton stepped out
for a moment. May I take a message?

440
00:49:08,001 --> 00:49:11,784
<i>Tell him they've cornered the infant</i>
<i>at the Hawthorn School...</i>

441
00:49:11,963 --> 00:49:14,418
<i>... in West Los Angeles.</i>

442
00:49:15,007 --> 00:49:16,798
That's a few blocks from here.

443
00:49:17,009 --> 00:49:20,627
<i>Ask the doctor to get over there</i>
<i>if he can. Thank you.</i>

444
00:49:28,770 --> 00:49:31,142
I have to go out for a while.

445
00:49:31,314 --> 00:49:32,689
All right.

446
00:49:32,898 --> 00:49:34,523
You don't mind staying alone?

447
00:49:36,193 --> 00:49:38,862
I'll keep everything warm.

448
00:49:59,881 --> 00:50:04,092
Wait a minute, I'm Frank Davis.
I wanna see Lieutenant Perkins.

449
00:50:04,260 --> 00:50:06,466
All right, take him.

450
00:50:22,818 --> 00:50:25,440
Wonder what's the matter with him.

451
00:50:25,613 --> 00:50:27,819
Screwed-up genes or something.

452
00:50:49,593 --> 00:50:51,550
Wait here.

453
00:51:46,394 --> 00:51:49,727
Davis, how the hell did you
find out about this?

454
00:51:50,606 --> 00:51:54,306
There was a phone call for Dr. Norton.
I took the message.

455
00:51:55,611 --> 00:51:57,437
My son Chris goes to school here.

456
00:51:57,654 --> 00:52:00,145
I've been here a million times,
PTA meetings.

457
00:52:01,616 --> 00:52:05,400
- Your kid goes here?
- That's right. He's in the sixth grade.

458
00:52:10,249 --> 00:52:12,040
Listen.

459
00:52:13,293 --> 00:52:15,333
Probably just a coincidence.

460
00:52:15,504 --> 00:52:19,168
Look, Perkins, I want this thing
destroyed as much as anybody else.

461
00:52:19,340 --> 00:52:21,297
- I realize that.
- Yeah, you realize.

462
00:52:21,467 --> 00:52:23,792
Then why is everybody looking at me?

463
00:52:24,929 --> 00:52:26,637
Yeah.

464
00:52:26,847 --> 00:52:30,891
Like it's my own flesh and blood
or something.

465
00:52:31,101 --> 00:52:34,968
Well, it's not! Understand?

466
00:52:35,146 --> 00:52:37,388
It's no relation to me.

467
00:52:39,192 --> 00:52:41,861
Nobody's looking at you.

468
00:53:21,146 --> 00:53:25,606
Say, you have my deepest sympathy.

469
00:53:25,775 --> 00:53:27,400
You and your wife.

470
00:53:27,569 --> 00:53:29,976
Is it all right
if your driver drops me off...

471
00:53:30,154 --> 00:53:33,155
...a block from my home?
I don't want my wife to see me.

472
00:53:33,366 --> 00:53:36,366
You don't want her to know
you were here tonight?

473
00:53:36,535 --> 00:53:40,615
I don't think she'd know how to take it.
Maybe I didn't do the right thing.

474
00:53:40,789 --> 00:53:44,122
I'm just trying to show everybody
I feel the same way they do.

475
00:53:44,292 --> 00:53:46,783
- I'm no different from anybody.
- We know that.

476
00:53:46,961 --> 00:53:49,119
I got a boy, 11 years old.
He's healthy.

477
00:53:49,297 --> 00:53:51,088
- He's brilliant.
- I understand.

478
00:53:51,298 --> 00:53:53,374
You don't have
to keep telling us that.

479
00:53:53,550 --> 00:53:57,215
We realize that.
Look, I gotta go back on duty.

480
00:54:09,690 --> 00:54:12,263
Take him wherever he wants to go.

481
00:55:39,271 --> 00:55:42,556
Davis said his kid went to this school.

482
00:55:44,234 --> 00:55:48,730
Now, why, in all of Los Angeles,
would it happen to show up here?

483
00:55:50,156 --> 00:55:53,110
Maybe it's looking for somebody.

484
00:57:15,525 --> 00:57:20,945
I'd like us to all get together again
and be a family.

485
00:57:21,155 --> 00:57:25,366
- I'm really trying very hard, Frank.
- I know, darling.

486
00:57:25,534 --> 00:57:26,944
I can see that.

487
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:30,114
Wouldn't it be a great idea
to bring Chris home?

488
00:57:30,622 --> 00:57:32,116
He's better off where he is.

489
00:59:33,191 --> 00:59:35,432
Lenore, did you go out?

490
00:59:48,538 --> 00:59:51,029
Lenore?

491
00:59:58,714 --> 01:00:01,169
Lenore.

492
01:00:01,341 --> 01:00:04,176
For chrissakes, answer me.

493
01:00:28,407 --> 01:00:30,613
Are you feeling better?

494
01:00:30,993 --> 01:00:32,902
Where the hell have you been?

495
01:00:33,078 --> 01:00:36,245
- I've been straightening up.
- I've been calling you.

496
01:00:39,584 --> 01:00:42,834
I've been all over the house,
straightening up.

497
01:00:44,255 --> 01:00:47,955
Where? You weren't downstairs.
Didn't you hear me calling you?

498
01:00:48,133 --> 01:00:50,838
Honey, there's a good movie on
with Paul Newman.

499
01:00:52,637 --> 01:00:55,211
I gotta get something in my stomach.

500
01:00:55,390 --> 01:00:57,715
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.

501
01:01:25,292 --> 01:01:27,664
Chris come back here today?

502
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:34,379
I said,
has Chris been back here today?

503
01:01:37,386 --> 01:01:39,462
No.

504
01:01:39,638 --> 01:01:41,714
Why do you say that?

505
01:01:48,313 --> 01:01:49,890
You wouldn't lie to me?

506
01:01:53,442 --> 01:01:57,440
I know you wanted Chris to come
back, but I specifically told you...

507
01:02:15,504 --> 01:02:17,496
Chris.

508
01:02:34,897 --> 01:02:36,936
Chris?

509
01:02:38,358 --> 01:02:40,931
Chris, are you hiding someplace?

510
01:02:42,570 --> 01:02:44,646
Don't fool around, now.

511
01:03:47,671 --> 01:03:50,707
I wish somebody would respect
my feelings around here.

512
01:03:50,924 --> 01:03:53,249
Why are you watching that stuff?

513
01:03:53,468 --> 01:03:55,875
I thought you wanted
to watch a movie.

514
01:04:01,266 --> 01:04:03,508
Who are you calling?
Don't call anybody.

515
01:04:03,685 --> 01:04:06,472
Please don't call anybody.
Who are you calling?

516
01:04:06,688 --> 01:04:09,439
- <i>How's Chris?</i>
- Had a hell of a time keeping him...

517
01:04:09,607 --> 01:04:11,350
...from the newscasts and papers.

518
01:04:11,526 --> 01:04:15,024
But the teacher sent over schoolwork,
so he's been keeping busy.

519
01:04:15,237 --> 01:04:17,111
You've been with him all the time?

520
01:04:17,322 --> 01:04:19,778
We just got back
from that fishing trip.

521
01:04:19,950 --> 01:04:22,322
He hasn't been out of my sight
for a minute.

522
01:04:22,494 --> 01:04:27,451
- Look, you wanna talk to him?
- No, I don't wanna talk to him.

523
01:04:28,916 --> 01:04:32,534
- Hi, Dad. When can I come home?
- Did you come back here today?

524
01:04:32,753 --> 01:04:35,125
Is the baby home
from the hospital yet?

525
01:04:38,425 --> 01:04:41,212
Did I do anything wrong?

526
01:04:41,386 --> 01:04:45,383
- Hey, how about something to eat?
- No, I'm not hungry. I wanna go to bed.

527
01:04:45,556 --> 01:04:48,759
- I'm sorry, Charley. I'm not mad at you.
- That's okay, kid.

528
01:04:48,976 --> 01:04:54,136
Honey, I want you to make love to me.
I want you to hold me and love me.

529
01:04:54,314 --> 01:04:56,105
You know, there are other ways.

530
01:04:56,274 --> 01:04:59,026
- Come on, sweetheart.
- There's no ice in there.

531
01:04:59,194 --> 01:05:03,321
I'll get the ice. Wait a minute,
I'll get the ice. Wait, I'll get the...

532
01:05:23,966 --> 01:05:25,674
Chris?

533
01:05:32,932 --> 01:05:34,925
Chris?

534
01:05:41,607 --> 01:05:44,857
Oh, my God. Chris!

535
01:05:53,659 --> 01:05:55,486
Lenore?

536
01:09:14,758 --> 01:09:17,379
What were you doing down
in the basement?

537
01:09:17,552 --> 01:09:19,959
You know.

538
01:09:50,498 --> 01:09:53,072
What are you gonna do?
What are you doing?

539
01:10:00,507 --> 01:10:03,592
Why are you so anxious
to be the one to do it?

540
01:10:15,896 --> 01:10:20,024
Who is it? Mom? Dad?

541
01:10:35,914 --> 01:10:38,203
Frank. Frank, wait. Wait. Wait.

542
01:10:38,417 --> 01:10:41,832
Frank, he could've killed you
when you were upstairs sleeping!

543
01:10:42,003 --> 01:10:44,079
- Let go of me.
- He could've killed you!

544
01:10:44,255 --> 01:10:46,746
Do you know why he didn't kill you?

545
01:10:53,055 --> 01:10:54,383
Hello?

546
01:10:57,726 --> 01:11:01,557
- He knows you're his father.
- What are you, crazy?

547
01:11:01,729 --> 01:11:03,058
He knows.

548
01:11:04,899 --> 01:11:08,018
He knows you're his father.

549
01:11:26,961 --> 01:11:30,210
Don't worry. Don't be scared.

550
01:11:33,049 --> 01:11:35,172
I'll protect you.

551
01:11:36,678 --> 01:11:40,509
It's a boy, you know. It's a boy.

552
01:11:40,723 --> 01:11:43,214
- I'll protect you.
- Chris, look out.

553
01:11:48,313 --> 01:11:50,222
I hit it. I'm sure I hit it.

554
01:11:50,732 --> 01:11:53,021
Charley! Look out, Charley!

555
01:11:56,195 --> 01:11:58,235
Charley!

556
01:12:03,077 --> 01:12:08,071
Go on, get down. Did you see it?
Did you see it? What does it look like?

557
01:12:08,373 --> 01:12:10,828
It's no relation to us, Chris.

558
01:12:12,126 --> 01:12:13,585
It can't be.

559
01:12:22,302 --> 01:12:24,971
See what your baby did to Charley?

560
01:12:27,932 --> 01:12:30,340
What did you do?

561
01:12:32,061 --> 01:12:35,181
Will you tell him
about the doctors in the hospital?!

562
01:12:35,689 --> 01:12:38,394
Lenore, take my son upstairs.

563
01:12:39,401 --> 01:12:43,233
The doctors at the hospital were trying
to suffocate your little brother.

564
01:12:43,405 --> 01:12:44,733
He just wants to live.

565
01:13:25,526 --> 01:13:29,903
You should've called us soon as you
began to suspect it was near the house.

566
01:13:30,072 --> 01:13:32,313
It's lost a lot of blood.

567
01:13:32,491 --> 01:13:36,784
And it's my opinion that our troubles
are very nearly over.

568
01:13:36,953 --> 01:13:41,330
- So shall we go?
- I wanna leave some men here.

569
01:13:41,582 --> 01:13:44,334
In case it decides
to double back to the house.

570
01:13:56,804 --> 01:13:58,512
I would...

571
01:13:58,681 --> 01:14:00,757
I would like to go with you.

572
01:14:00,933 --> 01:14:05,595
- Haven't you done enough already?
- No. Not yet.

573
01:14:07,689 --> 01:14:10,394
You have to be the one to do it,
don't you?

574
01:14:13,778 --> 01:14:15,438
Have you seen it?

575
01:14:16,030 --> 01:14:17,607
Got a real good look at it?

576
01:14:17,782 --> 01:14:20,948
It was too dark. It wouldn't matter.

577
01:14:21,785 --> 01:14:23,363
I could do it.

578
01:14:23,537 --> 01:14:27,320
You may have done it already,
if it doesn't stop bleeding.

579
01:14:28,458 --> 01:14:31,375
Will you excuse us
for a moment, please?

580
01:14:32,879 --> 01:14:34,705
We just can't take a civilian...

581
01:14:34,880 --> 01:14:40,005
Look, I advise you to let him come along.
After all, it found its way home by itself.

582
01:14:40,177 --> 01:14:45,088
It may be that it'll search out its father,
especially when he put a bullet in it.

583
01:14:45,265 --> 01:14:47,672
What have we got to lose?

584
01:14:48,142 --> 01:14:50,182
One more life.

585
01:14:55,107 --> 01:14:57,183
You know how to use a gun?

586
01:14:57,359 --> 01:14:59,316
Beg your pardon?

587
01:15:01,988 --> 01:15:04,396
Do you know how to use a rifle?

588
01:15:05,325 --> 01:15:06,735
Sure.

589
01:15:09,578 --> 01:15:12,365
We'll issue you one,
for your own protection.

590
01:15:12,539 --> 01:15:13,868
Okay.

591
01:15:15,751 --> 01:15:19,878
<i>The shot that wounded the infant was</i>
<i>fired not by the police but by its father...</i>

592
01:15:20,046 --> 01:15:23,296
<i>... public-relations executive</i>
<i>Frank Davis...</i>

593
01:15:23,466 --> 01:15:27,166
<i>... who currently is accompanying police</i>
<i>on the manhunt.</i>

594
01:16:01,375 --> 01:16:02,869
That's it.

595
01:16:03,043 --> 01:16:06,127
That's how it can travel
without anybody seeing it.

596
01:16:21,977 --> 01:16:28,015
<i>Units converge</i>
<i>at interceptor point 682 of project 9401</i>.

597
01:16:29,692 --> 01:16:32,895
<i>Close off block sections 21218...</i>

598
01:17:06,559 --> 01:17:10,639
<i>Divide units to cover all Sacatella,</i>
<i>L.A. River and...</i>

599
01:17:22,532 --> 01:17:27,656
<i>Drains 26 and 34, 1663560-O...</i>

600
01:17:27,828 --> 01:17:30,533
<i>... are now completely closed off</i>
<i>by our units.</i>

601
01:17:30,706 --> 01:17:33,956
<i>Hold position and stand by.</i>

602
01:18:08,198 --> 01:18:10,191
Let me have that.

603
01:18:16,456 --> 01:18:20,619
Davis, you stay right here.
Here, take this.

604
01:18:21,877 --> 01:18:24,249
Let's go. You stay here.

605
01:19:18,762 --> 01:19:20,589
It's back there somewhere.

606
01:19:20,764 --> 01:19:25,509
The damned fools must have walked
right by it. Now, I want that thing.

607
01:19:49,289 --> 01:19:50,949
- Where's Davis?
- I don't know.

608
01:19:51,124 --> 01:19:54,458
- He was supposed to stay here.
- Davis! Davis!

609
01:19:54,628 --> 01:19:57,628
Stay where you are,
we'll come get you!

610
01:20:03,177 --> 01:20:06,178
Davis! Davis, come back.

611
01:20:26,740 --> 01:20:28,567
Frank!

612
01:20:29,784 --> 01:20:32,536
Frank, do you hear me?

613
01:21:05,859 --> 01:21:08,528
Proceeding to Los Angeles River inlet,
as ordered.

614
01:22:02,952 --> 01:22:04,660
No.

615
01:22:08,332 --> 01:22:10,408
I know it...

616
01:22:11,668 --> 01:22:13,874
I know it hurts.

617
01:22:15,130 --> 01:22:19,127
I know that.
But everything's gonna be all right.

618
01:22:24,013 --> 01:22:26,052
See, I was...

619
01:22:36,440 --> 01:22:38,516
Well, I...

620
01:22:41,278 --> 01:22:44,195
I was scared, like you are.

621
01:22:45,991 --> 01:22:49,573
No, no. You mustn't cry.

622
01:22:50,161 --> 01:22:54,372
Because if you cry,
they'll hear you and they'll come.

623
01:23:20,480 --> 01:23:22,722
No, no. It's all right.

624
01:23:22,899 --> 01:23:24,938
It's gonna be all right.

625
01:23:25,360 --> 01:23:27,648
It's gonna be all right.

626
01:23:56,012 --> 01:23:57,590
Okay.

627
01:23:57,764 --> 01:23:59,223
Okay.

628
01:24:41,262 --> 01:24:43,883
Davis, come on out!

629
01:24:44,723 --> 01:24:47,095
Come on out, Davis!

630
01:24:49,311 --> 01:24:51,469
Where are you?

631
01:24:52,355 --> 01:24:54,182
Davis!

632
01:25:34,768 --> 01:25:39,928
<i>Davis has been seen moving through</i>
<i>the tunnel in possession of the infant.</i>

633
01:25:40,106 --> 01:25:43,060
Keep her here.

634
01:25:44,569 --> 01:25:47,486
<i>Drain stopped up ahead, impassable.</i>

635
01:25:47,697 --> 01:25:52,358
Can you hear me, Frank?
It can't be saved. It's gotta die.

636
01:25:52,534 --> 01:25:57,326
Just drop it and get the hell away
from it. Do you hear me, Frank?

637
01:26:44,373 --> 01:26:47,492
Frank! Can you hear me?

638
01:27:11,939 --> 01:27:15,390
All right, just stop there.
Stop right there.

639
01:27:20,530 --> 01:27:23,152
It can't hurt anybody.

640
01:27:29,580 --> 01:27:34,823
Look, lock it up. Study it.
But let it live, please.

641
01:27:35,753 --> 01:27:40,165
Put down your weapons. It's wounded.
It can't hurt anybody.

642
01:27:42,092 --> 01:27:46,385
Just drop it. Just drop it.
Just take it easy and drop it.

643
01:27:49,056 --> 01:27:50,385
Back away. Back away!

644
01:27:50,599 --> 01:27:54,928
If you fellas shoot, you're gonna shoot
me. Put the weapon down. It's harmless.

645
01:27:55,145 --> 01:27:57,351
That son of a bitch dies here and now!

646
01:27:57,564 --> 01:27:59,640
Drop it and stand aside, Davis.

647
01:28:02,193 --> 01:28:06,440
In one second, whether you're holding it
or not, I'll put a bullet through it.

648
01:28:06,655 --> 01:28:09,656
- Don't shoot.
- Kill it, lieutenant. Kill it!

649
01:28:09,825 --> 01:28:12,067
Kill it! Kill it now!

650
01:28:19,792 --> 01:28:23,078
Stop firing! Stop firing! Stop firing!

651
01:29:32,608 --> 01:29:35,063
Yeah, I'm bringing them home.

652
01:29:36,528 --> 01:29:40,656
<i>Lieutenant Perkins,</i>
<i>call for you on the private line.</i>

653
01:29:40,824 --> 01:29:42,484
Right.

654

Perkins.

655
01:29:52,084 --> 01:29:53,827
I understand.
